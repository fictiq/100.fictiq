## Introduction: Building Entities from Authent icated Attributes in Alligator Alley

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of entities within the **Alligator Alley** heterocosm using  Doležel's principle that fictional entities **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (i.e., this Codex and core narrative texts).*

*In Alligator Alley, this means every significant entity –  from a Gator-Baron to a specific species of Swamp Tyrant, a legendary hunting spear, or even the concept of "Crim son Tail Prime" – is defined by properties deeply intertwined with our core premise: **a world without beef, dominated by rept ilian cuisine.** Properties not listed are considered **undefined (undersaturated)** unless later authenticated by the Central Authenticational Authority (CAA).*

 *Focus on **authentication**: Only list properties considered 'true' or factual *for this world* based on our creative  decisions. Use comments `#` for notes, potential developments, or subjective perceptions attributed *to other characters* about this entity.*

### Summary: Entity Essence Profile

*Purpose: Briefly synthesize the core identity emerging from the property  bundle, reflecting its place in Alligator Alley.*

*   **Core Essence:** `[e.g., Silas  Kane is constituted as a veteran, highly skilled but deeply traditional Lead Hunter of the Blackwater Barony, his identity forged  by a life of dangerous proximity to Swamp Tyrants and unwavering adherence to ancient hunting codes. His existence is a testament to survival  and respect within a world that demands both from those who harvest its primary, perilous bounty.] `
*   **Primary Narrative Function:**  `[e.g., To represent the 'old ways' of hunting in contrast to newer, more exploitative methods; To  act as a mentor or obstacle to younger protagonists; To embody the risks and rewards of the Alligator Alley ecosystem.]`
*    **Key Internal Contradiction (if any, rooted in Alligator Alley's themes):** `[e.g.,  Deep respect for the Swamp Tyrants vs. the economic necessity of hunting them; Loyalty to a declining Baron vs. the  pragmatic need for survival in a changing world; Knowledge of sustainable hunting vs. pressure for larger quotas.]`
