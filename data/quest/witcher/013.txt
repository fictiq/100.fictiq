Velen (Continued)
Monster Nest (level 9)
Return to the "Crow's Perch" signpost and fast-travel to the "Burned Ruins" signpost. From there head north-east and cross a road to discover a Ghoul nest, guarded, of course, by several Ghouls (level nine). Kill them, blow up their nest, then loot it, and the burnt bodies nearby.

Objective	Reward
For destroying the Monster Nest	20 XP
Lindenvale
Follow the nearby road south, then when you reach a three-way fork, turn east. Follow this road east, then north-east, then east again, and finally south-east to reach Lindenvale, a small village that's worth going out of our way for in order to discover the signpost here. If you talk to the Blacksmith you'll start the quest "Of Swords and Dumplings". Apparently some master blacksmith-Hattori-has retired, and thus deprived the world of his talents. The Blacksmith also sells "Adalbert Kermith's Fourth Map" which, once read, will begin the quest "Scavanger Hunt: Cat School Gear Upgrade Diagrams - Part 4".

Play Gwent with both the Blacksmith and a Merchant in town to win some cards, then search the notice board and grab the following notices: "Contract: Monster in the Cemetery", "Monster in my Manor!", and "Contract on... Gods Know What On!" to start the quests "Contract: The Merry Widow", "The Fall of House Reardon", and "Contract: Mysterious Tracks". Busy town. As of now we're capable of easily completing "The Fall of House Reardon", and perhaps "Contract: The Merry Widow", but "Contract: Mysterious Tracks" is beyond our means at the moment.

Lastly, depending on your timing, you might want to consider talking to the Bookie outside the inn, where you can fight "Fishgulper", one of the fighters in the "Fists of Fury: Velen" quest. Before the fight, Fishgulper will ask you to take a dive so he can claim the purse to feed his family. If you do, you'll lose whatever coin you wagered, and will have to repeat the fight to progress the quest. If you beat Fishgulper without throwing the fight, you can give him five Crowns to help feed his family.

Objective	Reward
For defeating Fishgulper at fisticuffs	25 XP
2-140 Crowns
From Lindenvale to the Ferry Station
Spoils of War (level 4)
We'll deal with more of the quests in and around Lindenvale shortly, but for now, the signpost will suffice. Backtrack north-west along the road, then take a road to the north-east that leads over a bridge to get back on the central island in Velen. While crossing said bridge, take a dive off it to the north-west and swim up the river in that direction to find a "Spoils of War" event. Dive near the marker, shoot two Drowners (level four) with your crossbow, loot a skeleton near a sunken boat for an Aged Key, then unlock the nearby chest, where you can find-among other things-Moonblade, a relic-quality Silver Sword.

Note: Unique weapons like Moonblade actually level with you... to a degree. They usually remain a few levels below you, too. If such a weapon you found isn't to your liking, you can always consider reloading to a save before you started the quest/event, and come back for it later. Moonblade is a prime example of this, as the event required to complete it is laughably easy. Why not wait and come back for it when you really need an upgrade? Also... Moonblade was one of the most powerful Silver Swords in the first Witcher game. How it got here is anybody's guess.

Person(s) in Distress (level 16)
Cross the bridge and shortly you'll find a road running more or less east-west across the southern end of the island. If you head west, you'll find a very dangerous "Person(s) in Distress" encounter, where Slavers (level seven) are joined by Nilfgaardian Deserters (levels fourteen to sixteen). Simply put, if you're too low of a level, this fight is going to be pretty wretched. You'll have to make great effort to kill the two archers (perhaps using Quen to protect yourself), after which the fight becomes manageable, as the melee attackers are easy to parry, then exploit with a few strong attacks.

Once they're dead, loot one of them for the "Slaver's Key", then head to two houses near some docks. Enter the northern house and grab the "Unsent Note" off the floor, then unlock the cell, freeing a Swordsmith, who offers to reward you if you ever come around Mulbrydale. If you take him up on his offer you'll find that... well, it apparently just consists of doing business with you, telling you about Fergus-the master armorer-and playing some Gwent, although in the latter case, he doesn't seem to cough up a card.

Abandoned Site (level 4)
Follow the road past the bridge to the east (after either completing, or more likely, avoiding the previous event) to find an Abandoned Site guarded by four Drowners (level four). Kill them and peasants will move in, as well as some Nilfgaardian Soldiers to protect them.

Objective	Reward
For liberating the Abandoned Site	120 XP
50 Crowns
Hidden Treasure: An Unfortunate Turn of Events (level 10)
Search along the waterline to the east to find a corpse near a ruined boat, which you can loot to find an "Unsent Letter". Pick it up to start "An Unfortunate Turn of Events", then read it. Swim south-east from the body to find, under the water, a chest guarded by two Drowners (level ten). Kill them and loot the chest to score Harvall, a relic-quality Steel Sword that was in the first Witcher game. Like Moonblade, it's level scales with you.

Guarded Treasure (level 13)
Leave the Abandoned Site and continue east until you find a fork, at which you should head north-east to find a burnt-down house, near which is an Alghoul (level thirteen). It might be a bother to fight, if it had friends. Alas, it does not. Smite it and loot a chest and body near the house to complete this event.

Continue north-east past the burnt-down house until the trail ends at another road running north-south. Follow it south and when it forks again... eh, follow either one. Both trails lead to the same place-they reconnect to the east-west road we left earlier to explored the Guarded Treasure event. Where these paths reunite you'll find some Bandits (level five) attacking two merchants-Griwold and Anselm. Kill the Bandits and you'll be thanked by the merchants, who give you the pay set aside for their treacherous bodyguards.

Objective	Reward
For rescuing the merchants	25 XP
20 Crowns
Hidden Treasure: Tough Luck (Level 18)
Continue past the merchant's wagon and follow the road beyond to the north-east, ignoring a road to the south along the way. When the path splits north-east/north-west, head north-west until you spot a wagon north of the road. Head over to it, where you'll discover a "Hidden Treasure" event.

During the day you'll find a Foglet (level four), while at night there will be a pair of Nekkers (level eighteen). Naturally, you want to meet the former here, not the latter. Once the monster(s) are dead, search a body near the wagon to find a "Letter" to start the quest "Tough Luck". Read the Letter, then search to the south-west to find another-a women's-body, where you can find a "Small Key". Take it and open a chest that's losing a battle with gravity.

Monster Nest (level 9)
Backtrack to the east, then continue following the the road to the north-east, past a wagon north of the road (deja vu?), where you'l find a Ghoul nest. Kill the Ghouls (level nine) and blow up their nest north of the road. Once done, search around a wagon to the south of the road to find a chest.

Objective	Reward
For destroying the Monster Nest	20 XP
Bandit Camp (level 5)
Continue along the road to the north-east until you find a Bandit Camp south of the road, marked by abandoned wagons and ruined houses. Kill the Deserters (level five) nearby and loot a chest south of a destroyed building, near a campfire. There are also Ghouls (level two) prowling both north and south of the road.

Monster Nests (level 9)
A short ways along the road to the north-east you'll find a fork with new roads to the north (through an unmarked Nilfgaardian fort) and south-east. Standing in front of the fort, head due east into the wilderness, where you'll find a pair of Ghoul Nests near a destroyed trebuchet. Kill the Ghouls (level nine), then bomb their nests.

From the Ferry Station to Oxenfurt
Ferry Station
From the trebuchet, head south to find a road, which you should follow more or less south-east until you reach the Ferry Station. Kill some Ghouls (level nine), then loot the nearby house, the bodies south of it, and the docks. The Ferry Station serves a fine hub for the south-eastern part of this island, and there's plenty to do around it. To the north you'll find a "Treasure Hunt" event, along the shore to the west is a "Guarded Treasure" event, while finally, along the road to the south-east you'll find an "Abandoned Site".

Treasure Hunt: Lost Goods (level 4)
Head north into the wilderness until you find the "Treasure Hunt" event. At the map marker is a body which you can loot for "Nilfgaardian's Notes", which starts the quest "Lost Goods". Read the notes, then venture to the east to find a jetty, guarded by a pack of Drowners (level four). Kill them, then loot the parcels near the dock, and the chest in the swamp east of the dock to finish the quest.

Guarded Treasure (level 9)
From the Ferry Station follow a road running west along the shore. At the end of this road you'll find a larger than usual pack of Drowners (level nine) guarding a chest and some parcels on a beached boat. Try to kill them peicemeal, as there are quite a few of them, and they're clustered up pretty well. Once they're dead loot the nearby containers.

Abandoned Site (level 9)
Travel along a road south-east from the Ferry Station until you find a riverside fort, now abandoned to time and Necrophages. Four Ghouls (level nine) are led by an Alghoul (level nine). The Ghouls do an unfortunately effective job of serving as a distraction while fighting the Alghoul, which makes this encounter tougher than the lone level thirteen Alghoul we dispatched earlier. Try to lure the Ghouls out if you can-dispatching them one at a time... or at least, without the Alghoul present. If not, dodging, fast attacks, and Igni should work well enough. When the area is cleared a squad of Nilfgaardian soldiers will occupy the place, providing you with a merchant you can deal with, in the process.

Objective	Reward
For liberating the Abandoned Site	120 XP
50 Crowns
Abandoned Site (level 9)
Only one more event to do before we hit Oxenfurt... and it's another "Abandoned Site" event! Backtrack north, through the Ferry Station, back all the way to the Nilfgaardian fort we found earlier. Go through the fort and follow the road beyond until you find a fork to the south-east. Ignore the fork itself, and instead run due east at this point to find the "Abandoned Site", which is infested by some Drowners (level nine). Kill them and some Redanians will move in. Again, you'll get a new merchant to utilize.

Objective	Reward
For liberating the Abandoned Site	120 XP
50 Crowns
Oxenfurt
Return to the road by traveling west, then follow the road north until you reach a camp outside of Oxenfurt. Find the bridge leading over the river to the north-east to reach Oxenfurt, which you should be able to enter by presenting the "Letter of Safe Passage" to the guards near the gate. Once done, head on inside.

Head to the northern end of Oxenfurt to find the house Tamara is hiding in. Once inside you'll be pestered by the fisherman's brother before he brings Tamara out to talk to you. Hear her side of the story, and ask about her future plans before you're interrupted by a representative of the Eternal Fire. Before Tamara leaves, Geralt gives her the doll from the Bloody Baron. Loot the house before you leave, as you can find a "Mysterious Letter" in a container near the front windows.

Objective	Reward
For talking to Tamara	150 XP
