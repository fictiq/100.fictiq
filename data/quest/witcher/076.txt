Bombs
Bombs are good for... well, blowing things up, ideally. When created, you'll get a limited number of them to use (they can be replenished by resting, where you'll automatically use alcohol to concoct more)-higher grades of bombs will have more numbers in a stack. Throw them at enemies or use them to blow up Monster Nests. Depending on the bomb, they do everything from causing brute damage, to applying status effects.
