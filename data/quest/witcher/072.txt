Crafting Components
To make all those wonderful weapons and armor you'll need to kill monsters more effectively, you need components. Components can be found carelessly strewn throughout the world, in various container. Other weapons and otherwise useless items can also be dismantled for components. Sometimse that just doesn't suffice, though. When that happens, you can visit a craftsman and have them forge your lesser components (most of which can be purchased from various craftsmen) into rarer ones. Below are the diagrams for these, most-if not all-of which you will begin the game with.
