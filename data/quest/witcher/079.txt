Oils
Oils in The Witcher 3 are massively useful. You apply them to your swords (this uses up no charges, and costs you nothing besides the initial cost of crafting the oil) and you get a damage bonus against a specific foe based upon the grade of the oil-either 10%, 25% or 50%. These are hefty, free damage bonuses that only take a little foresight to gain. It's well worth your while to keep your Oils updated, and to apply them liberally.

Potions
One of the more basic-and effective-of a Witcher's tools are potions. You drink them, and you gain passive bonuses for a set duration. They have less toxicity and greater efficacy than Decoctions, but their duration is much shorter. Use these immediately before or during tough fights to make the most of them.
