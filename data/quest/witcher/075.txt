Alcohol
A pretty small and useless category, you'll find plenty of Alcohest and Dwarven Spirit all over the place. They're useful for replenishing expended Potions, Bombs, and Decoctions, but you never need to craft them. White Gull, on the other hand, is needed to make many of the more uncommon Alchemy Ingredients, which in turn are needed to upgrade more powerful Potions and Oils. The two rare components in White Gull-Cherry Cordial and Mandrake Cordial-can be purchased from various Innkeeps. Otherwise, don't expect to find too many in your exploration.
