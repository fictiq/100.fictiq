Child of the Elder Blood
Our destination is a rather insignificant island on the western edge of Skellige-west of Kaer Trolde, west of the "Eldberg Lighthouse" signpost, and due north of the Isle of Mists, which is you remember was on the north-western end of Undvik. Anyways, at this location are two islands-our destination is the north-western coast of the larger, southern of the two islands. Sail west, or if you have "The Pali Gap Coast" signpost, just fast-travel there.

Child of the Elder Blood (level 31)
Either way you get there, reach "The Pali Gap Coast" signpost and head south-east to find the entrance to some ruins. Continue south-east to find Yennefer and Ciri. Talk to the former and she'll work some magic that gives you access to the rest of the laboratory... but only after waking a Golem (level twenty-eight). Kill it and continue south-east to find cozy little chamber.

After the cutscene wait around for Yennefer to discover something (you can use your Witcher Senses to discover some trivial information about Avallac'h-namely that he has a sweet tooth) then head south-west and talk to Yennefer to learn what she uncovered. Head north-east, then turn south-east and head down some stairs to the south-west, then go down another flight of stairs to the south-east and search to the south-west to discover a genealogy, which prompts more discussion between the three.
