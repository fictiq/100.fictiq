Steel Swords
While Witchers are professional monster hunters, for some Witchers can't seem to avoid politics. Geralt is one of those Witchers, so keep your Steel Sword in good condition to fend off the humans and nonhumans who will pose as much of a threat as any Necrophage will during your travels.

Upgrades
Upgrades consist of Runestones and Glyphs, which can be inserted into weapons and armor to improve them. Typically it's less of a hassle to just buy the best versions from merchants, but if you find yourself with an abundance of lesser versions in your inventory, it might be worth upgrading them.
