Witcher Sets
Some of the best armor and weapon plans in the game aren't random, however, and are the subject of special quests-these are the "Witcher School" quests. There are three Witcher School gear sets (in the vanilla game, at least) and are well worth getting, as they tend to be quite a bit stronger than most other armors and weapons in the game. There are three full sets of Witcher School gear in the game-Cat (Feline), Griffin, and Bear (Ursine), light, medium, and heavy armor, respectively.
