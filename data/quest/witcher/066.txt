The Wild Hunt (Continued)
Ciri: Confidence or Doubt #4 - The Tantrum
Now search to the north-east and go through a door to find a bedroom. An occupied bedroom. After some rude words, Geralt and Yennefer will try to cheer Ciri up, giving you another opportunity to boost her confidence or cause doubt to stir behind her troubled brow. During a timed dialogue decision say "Go for it." to be a bad role model and indulge Ciri's temper tantrum, boosting her confidence, or say "Calm down." to cause her to doubt herself.

Ciri: Confidence or Doubt #5 - Last Respects for Skjall
Leave the laboratory and talk to Ciri, who will make another request of you, giving you yet another chance to influence her. She'll ask aboout Skjall, and when she gets the bad news, she'll ask you to accompany her to the grave. During a time dialogue response say "Yeah, I'll go with you." to start the quest "Skjall's Grave" and boost Ciri's confidence, or say "No time." to burden her with more doubt. If you started "Skjall's Grave", do that quest next, otherwise, skip to "On Thin Ice".

For searching Avallac'h's laboratory	300 XP
Skjall's Grave (level 28)
Ciri and Geralt will head to Hindarsfjall, where Ciri will look for Skjall's grave. What you say here doesn't matter, so feel free to respond how you wish. Ciri will see that Skjall is given the burial he deserves, and will react poorly when some Skelligers challenge her. When you two leave you'll get a chance to head back to Kaer Trolde with Ciri, or pass and mess around some more. Traveling back to Kaer Trolde doesn't lock you into anything, though-it's just a free trip. This will be your last chance to complete side quests, visit merchants, and prepare before you confront the Wild Hunt. When you're ready, head on board the ship and talk Avallac'h to complete "Battle Preparations" and start "On Thin Ice".
