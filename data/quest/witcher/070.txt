Crafting Information
How to Craft
The crafting system in The Witcher 3 is pretty simple. As you explore you'll find diagrams, formula, manuscript pages... even the odd book. All of these teach you new items you can craft... with some provisions. Some of these can be purchased from merchants. Usually merchants sell diagrams/formula that reflect their wares-blacksmiths sell armor and weapons, herbalists sell potion/bomb/oil/decoction recipes, for example. The plans merchants sell are static, but the ones you find in the wilderness are not, so you can't always count on having a specific potion, oil, or diagram... unless you're really thorough about completing events and side-quests.

In addition to plans, you'll need materials to craft items. Ore, leather, monster bits, herbs, alcohol, etc. Most of this stuff is pretty common, and again, if you search thoroughly, and break down items that have uncommon components (gem dust, rare metals, etc) you'll have more than enough... at least, later on, when you actually need it. Simple enough. But there's more. Only Armorers can craft armor, and Blacksmiths can craft weapons. There are also three grades of craftsman-Amateur, Journeyman, and Master. There's only one master craftsman of each type in the game, and you have to complete quests to get them to work for you. Complete "Of Swords and Dumplings" to gain the services of the master blacksmith (weapons), finishing "Master Armorer" will allow the master armorer to craft for you, and satisfying the demands of the master alchemist during "Practicum in Advanced Alchemy" will allow you to buy many of the best rune, glyph, potion, oil, and decoction plans from him.
