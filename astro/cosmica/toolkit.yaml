# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly detailed methodology** for the **systematic analysis 
    and structural mapping** of the [World Name] heterocosm, rigorously applying the core analytical 
    procedures derived from Doležel's semantic theory of fiction. It serves as an exhaustive toolkit 
    for dissecting the world's **textually constituted reality**.
  scope: |
    Guides the analyst through identifying authenticated propositions, mapping entity property bundles, 
    charting relational networks, reconstructing macro-structures (modalities, history, states), 
    and evaluating systemic coherence based *solely* on evidence within the defined canonical corpus.
  methodological_stance: |
    **Strictly Text-Centric & Semantic:** Analysis prioritizes the objective (intersubjectively verifiable 
    within the text) semantic and logical structures authenticated by the authoritative narrative discourse. 
    External factors (author biography, reader psychology, AW physics unless authenticated) are bracketed 
    during the core structural analysis. Focus is on the architecture *as built by language*.

# --- Procedure 1: Exhaustive Authentication Audit & Proposition Logging ---
# Purpose: Meticulously identify ALL potentially constitutive propositions within the canon and rigorously 
#          evaluate their authentication status to establish the world's factual baseline.
authentication_audit_logging:
  
  step_1_1_corpus_scan:
    method: "Systematic reading/viewing/playing of the defined canonical corpus."
    objective: "Identify *every* sentence, image, sound cue, or gameplay mechanic that potentially predicates existence, assigns a property, establishes a relation, states a rule, depicts an event, or describes a state relevant to the heterocosm."
    tooling: "[e.g., Digital annotation software, searchable text corpus, detailed scene/chapter logs, gameplay recording/analysis.]"

  step_1_2_source_authority_analysis:
    method: "For each potential proposition, identify its precise source within the narrative discourse."
    analysis_points:
      - "Identify Narrator Type/Voice: Omniscient, Limited Third, Reliable/Unreliable First, Implicit Discourse, etc. Assess its established reliability level based on internal textual evidence."
      - "Analyze Character Discourse: Determine character reliability regarding specific topics based on their authenticated knowledge (Epistemic), biases (Psychological/Axiological), and narrative function. Distinguish between authenticated subjective belief/perception and objective world-fact assertion."
      - "Evaluate In-World Documents/Media: Assess the authenticated reliability of texts, recordings, or interfaces presented *within* the heterocosm."
      - "Cross-Reference Sources: Check for corroboration or contradiction between different narrative sources regarding the same proposition."
    output: "Assign an 'Authentication Strength' score/category (e.g., High Authority, Moderate Authority, Low Authority/Subjective, De-Authenticated/Unreliable) to each proposition based on source analysis."

  step_1_3_proposition_cataloging:
    method: "Log all propositions deemed to have sufficient positive authentication into a structured database or detailed index."
    required_fields_per_entry:
      - "Proposition ID (Unique)"
      - "Proposition Text/Description (Exact wording or precise summary)"
      - "Subject Entity ID(s)"
      - "Predicate Type (Existence, Property Assignment, Relation, Rule, Event, State)"
      - "Property/Relation Category (if applicable - using Doležel's taxonomy)"
      - "Authentication Source(s) (Specific Textual Citation - page, timestamp, dialogue line, Codex entry ref)"
      - "Authenticating Voice/Narrator Type"
      - "Authentication Strength (Rated in Step 1.2)"
      - "Temporal Context (Specific time/era within heterocosm)"
      - "Canon Tier (If applicable)"
      - "Analyst Notes (Ambiguities, cross-references, potential issues)"
    tooling: "[e.g., Relational database (Airtable, SQL), structured spreadsheet, dedicated qualitative analysis software.]"

  rationale_step_1: |
    This exhaustive, evidence-based logging creates the verifiable dataset upon which all subsequent structural 
    analysis depends. Rigorous authentication assessment is non-negotiable for maintaining analytical objectivity 
    within Doležel's framework.

# --- Procedure 2: Detailed Entity Constitution Mapping (Property Bundle Reconstruction) ---
# Purpose: Systematically reconstruct the 'property bundle' for key entities by collating and categorizing 
#          their authenticated predicates according to Doležel's taxonomy.
entity_constitution_mapping:

  step_2_1_entity_selection:
    method: "Identify key entities (persons, objects, places, creatures, factions, concepts) crucial for understanding the world's structure, narrative, or themes."
    criteria: "[e.g., Narrative centrality, frequency of appearance, thematic significance, embodiment of unique world rules/elements.]"

  step_2_2_predicate_collation:
    method: "Query/filter the logged propositions (from Procedure 1) to gather ALL authenticated predicates associated with the selected entity."

  step_2_3_taxonomic_categorization:
    method: "Assign each authenticated predicate to its appropriate category within Doležel's taxonomy:"
    categories_detailed:
      - "Physical Properties (Form, Material, Sensory Signature - visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, gustatory, atmospheric)"
      - "Functional Properties (Innate Abilities, Learned Skills, Tech/Magic Functions, Operational Parameters, Inabilities, Vulnerabilities, Costs, Dependencies, Constraints)"
      - "Psychological Properties (Traits, Emotions, Cognitive Style/Abilities, Beliefs, Motivations, Subjective Memories, Flaws)"
      - "Social/Relational Properties (Formal Roles, Social Status/Hierarchy, Factional Affiliations/Allegiances, Kinship Ties)"
      - "Categorical Properties (Species, Type, Classifications)"
      - "Modal Properties (Unique Alethic Status - e.g., immortality; Unique Deontic Status - e.g., binding oath; Unique Axiological Status - e.g., inherently sacred; Unique Epistemic Status - e.g., cannot lie)"
      - "Axiological Properties (Perceived Value - Reputation, Moral Standing *within world*, Aesthetic Judgment *within world*)"
      - "Historical Properties (Origin, Past Experiences, Lineage, Provenance, Embodied Change/Continuity)"
    technique: "Requires careful semantic analysis of the predicate's content and function."

  step_2_4_bundle_synthesis_analysis:
    method: "Synthesize the categorized properties into a coherent profile for the entity."
    analysis_points:
      - "Multifacetedness Assessment: Across how many categories is the entity significantly defined? How detailed is the definition within key categories?"
      - "Internal Coherence Check: Are there logical contradictions *within* the authenticated bundle itself (e.g., conflicting functional properties, psychological traits incompatible with actions)?"
      - "Identification of Core Essence: What specific combination of properties defines the entity's unique identity and primary function within the world?"
      - "Undersaturation Mapping: Explicitly identify significant properties *not* authenticated for this entity across all relevant categories."

  output_step_2: "Detailed, evidence-based constitutional profiles for key heterocosmic entities, structured by property type."
  rationale_step_2: "Provides a systematic anatomy of fictional beings based purely on their authenticated textual definition."

# --- Procedure 3: Comprehensive Relational Network Analysis ---
# Purpose: Map the authenticated connections between entities to reveal the structural fabric of the heterocosm 
#          (social, political, spatial, causal networks).
relational_network_analysis:

  step_3_1_relation_identification_logging:
    method: "Scan authenticated propositions (from Procedure 1) specifically identifying predicates establishing relations *between two or more* authenticated entities."
    relation_types_to_map: "[Spatial (location, proximity, topology), Temporal (sequence, simultaneity), Social (hierarchy, alliance, enmity, affiliation), Kinship, Causal (event/action links), Intentional (belief, desire, emotion *towards* another entity), Part-Whole, Comparative.]"
    logging_fields: "[e.g., Relation ID, Entity A ID, Entity B ID, Relation Type, Specific Nature (e.g., 'Antagonistic - Active Pursuit'), Authentication Source, Temporal Context, Canon Tier.]"

  step_3_2_network_mapping_visualization:
    method: "Organize the identified relations to reveal structural patterns."
    techniques:
      - "Social Network Graphs: Visualizing alliances, rivalries, communication flows between persons/factions."
      - "Spatial Mapping: Linking entities to locations, mapping territories, analyzing proximity/distance constraints."
      - "Causal Chain Diagrams: Mapping key plot events and their authenticated causes/effects."
      - "Hierarchical Charts: Depicting authenticated political or organizational structures."
    tooling: "[e.g., Network analysis software (Gephi), diagramming tools (Lucidchart, draw.io), GIS for spatial mapping if applicable.]"

  step_3_3_network_structure_analysis:
    method: "Analyze the properties of the mapped network."
    analysis_points:
      - "Density & Connectivity: Is the network sparsely or densely connected? Are there isolated clusters or central hubs?"
      - "Dominant Relation Types: Are certain types of relations (e.g., conflict, hierarchy) particularly prevalent?"
      - "Structural Holes & Bridges: Are there entities connecting otherwise separate groups? Are there significant gaps in expected relations?"
      - "Power Dynamics: How does the network structure reflect and reinforce authenticated power relations?"

  output_step_3: "A detailed map and analysis of the heterocosm's structural organization based on authenticated relations."
  rationale_step_3: "Reveals the systemic context in which entities operate, moving beyond individual constitution to world architecture."

# --- Procedure 4: Macro-Structure Reconstruction (Modalities, History, States) ---
# Purpose: Synthesize authenticated data to define the overarching rules, history, and context governing the entire heterocosm.
macro_structure_reconstruction:

  step_4_1_modal_system_inference:
    method: "Analyze patterns across *all* authenticated propositions (entity properties, relations, events) to infer the world's fundamental governing modalities."
    process_per_modality:
      - "Alethic: Collate all authenticated possibilities/impossibilities, costs/limits of forces (magic/tech). Formulate concise statements of the core physical/metaphysical laws."
      - "Deontic: Collate all authenticated laws, codes, obligations, permissions, prohibitions, and consistent consequences for adherence/violation. Define the normative system(s)."
      - "Axiological: Collate all authenticated value judgments, depictions of desirable/undesirable states, recurring symbols of value. Reconstruct the core value hierarchy/system."
      - "Epistemic: Collate all authenticated limits on knowledge, statements about source reliability, patterns of information flow/control. Define the rules of knowing."
    output: "Explicit definition of the core authenticated modalities governing Aethelgard."

  step_4_2_historical_timeline_construction:
    method: "Assemble all authenticated historical facts and temporal relations into a coherent, chronologically ordered Master Timeline."
    process: "Verify dates, sequences, causal links between authenticated events. Explicitly document periods of authenticated uncertainty or conflicting accounts (based on source reliability). Identify major turning points and their authenticated consequences."
    output: "The definitive authenticated historical record of the Aethelgard heterocosm."

  step_4_3_global_state_definition:
    method: "Collate authenticated propositions describing the prevailing political, social, economic, environmental, etc., conditions for specific key narrative periods (especially the 'Now')."
    process: "Synthesize these into a coherent description of the world state, ensuring consistency between different aspects (e.g., economy aligns with tech level and political situation)."
    output: "Defined snapshots of the heterocosm's global state at crucial points."

  rationale_step_4: "Reconstructs the foundational 'operating system' and contextual backdrop against which all specific entities and events must be understood."

# --- Procedure 5: Systemic Interplay Analysis & Final Coherence Evaluation ---
# Purpose: Synthesize all preceding analyses to evaluate the heterocosm as an integrated system and assess its overall internal coherence.
systemic_interplay_coherence_evaluation:

  step_5_1_mapping_interconnections_detailed:
    method: "Explicitly trace and analyze the causal and influential links *between* the different identified layers: How do specific Modal laws constrain specific Entity properties? How does History shape specific Global States? How do Entity actions (driven by Properties/Relations) operate within Global States and test Modal limits?"
    technique: "Use case studies of key narrative sequences or systemic processes (e.g., 'The Dust Economy Cycle,' 'Investigating a Temporal Anomaly')."

  step_5_2_rigorous_consistency_audit:
    method: "Actively search for contradictions or inconsistencies across *all* levels of authenticated data."
    checklist_items:
      - "Are any entity properties incompatible with established Modalities?"
      - "Do any narrative events violate established causal logic or Alethic limits?"
      - "Does the present Global State contradict authenticated History?"
      - "Are character actions inconsistent with their authenticated Psychological/Functional/Social profile within the given context?"
      - "Do different canonical sources present conflicting authenticated realities (after accounting for reliability/perspective)?"
    output: "A list of identified points of coherence and documented inconsistencies requiring explanation or acknowledgement."

  step_5_3_evaluating_structural_integrity:
    method: "Based on the consistency audit and interplay analysis, make a final assessment of the heterocosm's overall structural integrity and logical soundness *on its own terms*."
    criteria: "[e.g., Degree of internal consistency, richness of meaningful interconnections, plausible causality (within world rules), functional coherence of systems.]"
    output: "A critical evaluation of the world's architectural success according to Doležel's principles."

  rationale_step_5: "Moves beyond analyzing parts to assessing the functional coherence and integration of the heterocosm as a complete semantic system."

# --- VI. Methodological Stance & Boundaries (Analyst's Guide) ---
methodological_stance_boundaries:
  purpose: "Reiterate the guiding principles and limitations for analysts employing this protocol."
  core_principles:
    - "**Textual Evidence Paramount:** All analytical claims MUST be directly supported by specific, cited evidence of authentication within the defined canonical corpus."
    - "**Internal Logic First:** Evaluate consistency and plausibility based on Aethelgard's *own established rules (modalities)*, not external AW standards."
    - "**Semantic & Structural Focus:** Prioritize analysis of meaning structures, logical relations, property bundles, and systemic interplay."
    - "**Respect Undersaturation:** Clearly distinguish authenticated facts from undefined gaps; avoid speculative filling presented as objective analysis."
  bracketed_areas: "[Authorial biography/psychology, subjective reader response/affect (as primary data), external scientific/historical critique (unless invited by realist mode), non-canonical sources.]"
  goal_of_analysis: "To produce a rigorous, evidence-based, structural-semantic map and analysis of the Aethelgard heterocosm as constituted by its authoritative discourse."

# --- Conclusion: The Analyst as Semantic Cartographer & Architect ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    This protocol outlines the core methodological procedures derived from Doležel's framework for 
    analyzing the Aethelgard heterocosm. It mandates a rigorous, text-centric approach focused on 
    **identifying authentications, mapping property bundles, charting relational networks, reconstructing 
    macro-structures (modalities, history, states), and evaluating systemic coherence**.
  role_of_analyst: |
    The analyst employing this toolkit functions as a **semantic cartographer**, meticulously mapping the 
    terrain of the textually constituted reality, and as a **structural architect (in reverse)**, 
    deconstructing the edifice to understand its design principles, load-bearing elements, internal logic, 
    and overall integrity.
  final_statement: |
    By adhering to these procedures, the analyst can move beyond impressionistic readings to provide a deep, 
    evidence-based understanding of the intricate 'Architecture of Meaning' that defines Aethelgard, revealing 
    the full scope and power of its linguistic forge.
