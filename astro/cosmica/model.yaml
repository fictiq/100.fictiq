# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly detailed framework** for the **explicit legislation and rigorous 
    codification** of the **Foundational Governing Laws (Modal Structures)** of the Aethelgard heterocosm. 
    Applying Doležel's theory, it treats these modalities not as emergent properties but as **primary, 
    constitutive attributes predicated onto the world-system itself** by the Sovereign Authenticator(s)/CAA 
    via the Master Codex and core canonical texts.
  scope: |
    Defines the **absolute, non-negotiable operating system** of Aethelgard's reality, encompassing all 
    fundamental rules governing Possibility/Necessity (Alethic), Obligation/Permission (Deontic), Value 
    (Axiological), and Knowledge/Belief (Epistemic). Adherence to these authenticated modalities is the 
    **supreme test of canonical consistency** for all entities, events, and narratives within the heterocosm.
  ontological_premise: |
    The modalities **ARE** the fundamental architecture defining the logical space of Aethelgard. They exist 
    solely through **textual authentication** and possess **internal validity only**. Their structure dictates 
    the limits and potentials of all existence and action within this specific 'other world'.

# --- Article I: Alethic Modality (The Statutes of Possibility & Necessity) ---
# Purpose: Define the absolute boundaries of what *can* and *cannot* physically, metaphysically, 
#          or technologically occur within Aethelgard, establishing its core operational reality.
alethic_modality:
  title: "Article I: The Authenticated Laws of Being and Causality"
  
  section_1_1_baseline_physics_causality:
    title: "Baseline Physical Reality & Causal Principles"
    authenticated_laws:
      - law_id: "ALE_BASE_001"
        statement: "Standard Model Analogue (Constrained): Basic principles analogous to AW physics (gravity, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, basic mechanics) **apply by default**, providing a baseline for interaction and expectation, **UNLESS** explicitly superseded by authenticated Chrono-Tech effects, Aberration influence, Artificer phenomena, or specific localized anomalies."
        implication: "Provides grounding, makes deviations impactful. Requires specific authentication for *any* non-standard physics."
        consistency_note: "All technological/biological functions must adhere to this baseline unless exception is explicitly authenticated and its mechanism defined."
      - law_id: "ALE_BASE_002"
        statement: "Linear Causality (Dominant but Fragile): Cause **must precede effect** in the primary temporal flow. While Chrono-Tech permits observation/minor perturbation of the local past/present, authenticated attempts to **retroactively alter established macro-historical events** inevitably fail and trigger severe Paradox effects (ALE_RISK_001)."
        implication: "History is largely fixed; focus is on consequences, not retroactive fixes. Allows for localized temporal weirdness without breaking core causality."
        consistency_note: "No authenticated mechanism allows for successful causal rewriting of Tier 1/2 historical events."

  section_1_2_chrono_technology_alethic_limits:
    title: "Specific Alethic Parameters of Authenticated Chrono-Technology"
    authenticated_laws:
      - law_id: "ALE_CTECH_001"
        statement: "Temporal Viewing (Echo Observation): Authenticated Chrono-Viewers **CAN** render limited, degrading sensory echoes of events within a defined spatio-temporal proximity (e.g., <24hrs, <10m radius), but **CANNOT** interact with or alter the viewed past. Accuracy is **inherently imperfect** and subject to interference/degradation."
        implication: "Provides investigative tool but with severe epistemic/functional limits."
      - law_id: "ALE_CTECH_002"
        statement: "Localized Perturbation (Stasis/Stutter): Authenticated devices **CAN** create localized fields temporarily slowing or halting temporal flow within small volumes, requiring continuous power (Dust) and **risking field collapse/instability**."
        implication: "Allows for specific tactical/preservation uses but inherently unstable/costly."
      - law_id: "ALE_CTECH_003"
        statement: "Paradox Threshold & Consequence Spectrum: Attempts at *any* temporal manipulation beyond simple observation carry Paradox Risk. Risk **escalates non-linearly** based on: duration, spatial scope, energy input, causal significance of targeted event. Consequences range from minor local distortions & Temporal Sickness -> Aberration summoning -> localized reality fragmentation -> (Theoretical) full timeline erasure (unconfirmed/legendary)."
        implication: "Establishes inherent danger and scaling cost/risk for core tech."
      - law_id: "ALE_CTECH_004"
        statement: "Chrono-Dust Necessity & Properties: All known/Guild Chrono-Tech **NECESSARILY requires** refined Chrono-Dust as fuel/catalyst. Dust **IS** finite (within current understanding), **degrades** over time/use, and **IS** the source of Temporal Sickness upon sufficient exposure."
        implication: "Creates core resource dependency, economic driver, biological hazard."
      - law_id: "ALE_CTECH_005"
        statement: "Impossibility of Temporal Creation/Reversal (Macro): Known Chrono-Tech **CANNOT** create energy/matter from nothing via time loops, nor fundamentally reverse entropy on a significant scale, nor achieve true predictive prophecy beyond probabilistic analysis of echoes."
        implication: "Closes common time-travel loopholes; maintains thermodynamic/causal consistency."

  section_1_3_biological_ontological_possibilities:
    title: "Authenticated Parameters of Life, Death, and Being"
    authenticated_laws:
      - law_id: "ALE_BIO_001"
        statement: "Human Baseline & Mortality: Baseline humans **possess** standard AW-analogous biological functions and limitations (aging, disease susceptibility, physical damage thresholds) and **ARE mortal**. Death, once authenticated (brain function ceases), **IS final** and irreversible by known/authenticated means."
        implication: "Establishes stakes of physical conflict and mortality."
      - law_id: "ALE_BIO_002"
        statement: "Temporal Sickness Pathophysiology: Authenticated effects of Chrono-Dust overexposure **include** cumulative neurological damage (memory fragmentation, sensory distortion), cellular degradation (premature aging appearance), increased susceptibility to paradox effects, and potentially mutation (Undercity specific?)."
        implication: "Defines specific cost/hazard of the environment/technology."
      - law_id: "ALE_BIO_003"
        statement: "Automaton Constitution (Baseline): Standard Automatons **ARE** complex clockwork/analytical engines animated by Chrono-Dust cores running programmed memory loops. They **LACK** inherent biological processes, true consciousness, or independent agency beyond their programming (baseline models)."
        implication: "Defines their fundamental nature as distinct from biological life."
      - law_id: "ALE_BIO_004"
        statement: "Aberration Nature (Partial Definition): Temporal Aberrations **ARE** entities partially displaced from standard spacetime, exhibiting **authenticated immunity** to conventional physical force and **authenticated ability** to cause localized temporal/spatial distortions. Their origins/full capabilities **remain epistemically limited** (see EPI_LAW_00X)."
        implication: "Defines unique threat type operating under different rules."
      # --- Add laws for specific species if applicable ---

  section_1_4_metaphysical_cosmological_principles:
    title: "Authenticated Rules Governing Fundamental Reality (If Applicable)"
    authenticated_laws:
      - law_id: "ALE_META_001"
        statement: "Nature of Soul/Consciousness: Existence/nature of a non-physical 'soul' separate from biological/mechanical function **is unauthenticated** within the heterocosm's established reality. 'Consciousness' is defined only by observable/authenticated cognitive/psychological properties."
        implication: "Maintains a generally materialistic/mechanistic baseline unless specific spiritual elements are introduced & authenticated."
      - law_id: "ALE_META_002"
        statement: "Nature of Fate/Destiny: No evidence for **absolute, immutable destiny** is authenticated. Prophecies (if any) are authenticated only as high-probability *predictions* based on temporal analysis or as influential *beliefs*, not as fixed future facts."
        implication: "Preserves character agency (within other constraints); focuses on causality over predestination."
      # --- Add laws for dimensions, divinity, fundamental forces if relevant & authenticated ---

  alethic_undersaturation_notes: "[e.g., Precise mechanics of Paradox events; full range of Aberration types/abilities; limits of Artificer tech; possibility of other dimensions/entities beyond current authentication.]"
  alethic_consistency_prompt: "Can ANY authenticated event or entity function described elsewhere in the Codex violate these fundamental Alethic laws without an explicitly authenticated exception rooted in THESE SAME laws (e.g., Artificer tech exception ALE_CTECH_006)?"

# --- Article II: Deontic Modality (The Statutes of Obligation & Permission) ---

        statement: "Primacy of Guild Charters (Implicitly Authenticated): Council Edicts often **defer to or are heavily influenced by** pre-existing or newly negotiated Guild Charters regarding resource control, internal governance, and technological application."
        implication: "Weak central authority; fragmented legal landscape."
      - law_id: "DEO_LEGAL_002"
        statement: "Prohibition of Unsanctioned Temporal Manipulation: Deliberate creation of paradoxes, unauthorized historical viewing impacting Guild interests, or weaponization of Chrono-Tech **carry severe penalties** (authenticated as including memory wipe, forced Undercity exile, potential termination)."
        implication: "High stakes for core technology misuse; tool for Guild control."
      - law_id: "DEO_LEGAL_003"
        statement: "Restricted Access & Movement: Specific zones (Guild HQs, Archives, anomaly sites, Undercity access points) **are authenticated as legally restricted**, requiring specific clearance levels enforced by Watch/Guild Security."
        implication: "Creates physical/social barriers; enables infiltration plots."
      - law_id: "DEO_LEGAL_004"
        statement: "Property Rights (Automatons): Automatons **are authenticated as legal property** of their owner/Guild, lacking individual rights or legal standing."

        faction: "Memory Keepers"
        statement: "**Duty of Curated Preservation:** Members **are obligated** to preserve historical records but also **permitted (or potentially obligated by internal doctrine)** to 'clarify' or 'redact' information deemed destabilizing or contradictory to the 'accepted' Guild/Council narrative." # Note the authenticated ambiguity/potential conflict
        consequence_for_violation: "[e.g., Loss of archive access, potential 're-education' or memory adjustment.]"
      - code_id: "DEO_UNDERCITY_SC_01"
        faction: "Salvager Crews (General Custom)"
        statement: "**Code of Salvage & Aid (Informal but Enforced):** Strong expectation **exists** to share immediate hazard warnings (collapses, Aberrations) within trusted networks; disputes over salvage claims often resolved by established crew leader hierarchy or direct violence; betraying one's crew **is** the ultimate taboo."
        consequence_for_violation: "[Ostracism, violence, being left behind.]"

      - norm_id: "DEO_NORM_02"
        statement: "**Taboo on Overt Temporal Displays:** Flaunting personal Chrono-Tech wealth or engaging in casual temporal manipulation in public **is considered** reckless, arrogant, and invites negative attention/suspicion (links to AXI_LAW_003)."
        social_consequence: "[Social disapproval, attracting unwanted Guild/Watch scrutiny.]"
      - norm_id: "DEO_NORM_03"
        statement: "**Undercity Distrust Norm:** Default assumption **is** that Surface dwellers (esp. Guild members, Watch) are untrustworthy and likely exploitative."
        social_consequence: "[Difficulty for outsiders gaining trust/access/cooperation in Undercity.]"

  epistemic_consistency_prompt: "Do characters succeed or fail in obtaining information consistent with these authenticated rules of access and reliability? Are 'convenient' knowledge gains avoided?"

# --- Conclusion: Modalities as the Immutable Foundation ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    This protocol codifies the **Fundamental Modalities** – the supreme governing laws – of the Aethelgard 
    heterocosm. The authenticated principles of **Possibility/Necessity (Alethic), Obligation/Permission 
    (Deontic), Value (Axiological), and Knowledge/Belief (Epistemic)** collectively form the immutable 
    **constitution and operating system** of this fictional reality.
  final_statement: |
    All entities, events, states, and narrative developments within Aethelgard **must operate** coherently 
    within this established modal architecture. These laws, forged by **authenticated predication**, provide 
    the ultimate structural foundation, defining the world's unique logic, enabling its specific narrative 
    potentials, grounding its thematic explorations, and ensuring its internal consistency. Understanding 
    and respecting this foundational layer is paramount for both creation and analysis within the Aethelgard 
    semantic universe.

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Modalities:

Constitutional Framing: Uses Articles, Sections, and explicit "Statutes" or "Principles" to frame modalities as the fundamental, legislated laws of the world.

Granular Modal Breakdown: Requires defining specific rules, principles, and hierarchies within each modality (Alethic, Deontic, Axiological, Epistemic).

Emphasis on Authentication & Source: Demands clear authentication and often hints at the type of authentication needed (e.g., explicit statement vs. consistent pattern vs. tech spec).

Detailed Implications & Functions: Requires articulating the specific narrative and thematic implications or functions of each authenticated modal rule.

Inter-Modal Awareness: Prompts consideration of how different modalities interact (e.g., Deontic rules constrained by Alethic possibility).

Specificity in Examples: Uses highly specific examples drawn from the Aethelgard concept (Chrono-Tech limits, Guild laws, historical impact, Aberration nature) to illustrate the application of modal principles.

Rigorous Consistency Prompts: Includes prompts demanding checks for consistency within each modality and consideration of how rules are applied across the narrative.

Explicit Undersaturation Notes: Requires acknowledging what remains undefined even within the fundamental rules, preserving mystery and potential.

Formal Conclusion: Ends with a strong affirmation of the modalities as the immutable foundation, reinforcing their supreme importance in Doležel's framework.

This extremely detailed YAML provides a powerful tool for meticulously designing and documenting the core operating system of Aethelgard, ensuring its fundamental laws are clear, consistent, purposeful, and provide a robust foundation for all other world elements and narratives.
