## Introduction: Applying a Critical Lens to World Architecture

*This protocol guides a **critical self-evaluation** of the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm, using the analytical criteria derived from Doležel's framework. Having designed the world's entities, laws, states, and history, this step involves assessing the success of that construction based on principles of **internal coherence, systemic richness, purposeful originality, and structural thematic resonance**.*

*The goal is to objectively evaluate the world's structural integrity, functional integration, and overall effectiveness *on its own terms*, identifying strengths to amplify and weaknesses to address before finalizing narrative development.*

---

## I. Evaluation of Internal Coherence & Logic

*Purpose: To rigorously assess the world's adherence to its own authenticated rules and facts, treating consistency as a key measure of success.*

*   **Criterion: Adherence to Authenticated Modalities**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** Does the world consistently operate within the fundamental physical/metaphysical possibilities (Alethic), ethical/legal constraints (Deontic), value systems (Axiological), and knowledge limits (Epistemic) established in the Codex/Bible?
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Cite specific examples from planned narratives or Codex entries where rules are strictly followed. Note any potential or actual violations.]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Rate: Highly Consistent / Mostly Consistent / Some Notable Issues / Frequent Inconsistencies]`
    *   **Refinement Notes:** `[e.g., "Need to reinforce consequences for breaking Deontic rule DEO-01 consistently." or "Alethic limit ALE-02 feels occasionally bent for plot convenience; need stronger justifications or revisions."] `

*   **Criterion: Diachronic Consistency (Across Time)**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** Do authenticated facts, entity properties, and world states remain stable across the established timeline unless changes are explicitly authenticated and logically justified?
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Review key historical points vs. present state; track character property stability vs. development; check object function consistency.]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Rate: Highly Consistent / Mostly Consistent / Some Lapses / Problematic Retcons]`
    *   **Refinement Notes:** `[e.g., "Character X's backstory established in Codex needs slight adjustment to align perfectly with HIST_Event_Y." or "Ensure the economic impact of HIST_Event_Z is reflected consistently in all scenes set afterward."] `

*   **Criterion: Synchronic Consistency (Simultaneous States)**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** Are different elements authenticated as existing or occurring at the same time logically compatible? (e.g., individual properties vs. world laws; interacting systems).
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Examine specific complex scenarios or locations. Do environmental states match technological limits? Do social norms align with political realities? Do character abilities fit within world physics? ]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Rate: Highly Coherent / Generally Compatible / Some Logical Friction / Significant Contradictions]`
    *   **Refinement Notes:** `[e.g., "The coexistence of extreme surveillance (Political State) and thriving secret societies (Social Element) needs clearer explanation of *how* secrets are maintained – perhaps via specific counter-tech or blind spots."] `

*   **Overall Coherence Judgment:** Based on the above, how robust is the internal logical integrity of this heterocosm?
    *   `[Provide summary judgment, e.g., "The world demonstrates strong internal coherence regarding its core mechanics and history, but requires tightening consistency in character capabilities relative to established limits."]`

*   **# Self-Critique Prompt:** *Imagine you are a skeptical reader trying to find plot holes or logical flaws based *only* on the rules *you* have established. Where would they succeed? How can you preemptively fix those weaknesses?*

## II. Evaluation of Systemic Richness & Integration

*Purpose: To assess the complexity, depth, and functional integration of the world's components, valuing interconnectedness.*

*   **Criterion: Density of Interconnections**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** Are the key systems (History, Politics, Economy, Tech/Magic, Environment, Society) demonstrably and meaningfully interconnected? Do changes in one area plausibly ripple through others?
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Refer to Systemic Interplay Protocol. Are the mapped connections numerous, logical, and non-trivial?]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Rate: Highly Integrated / Moderately Interconnected / Somewhat Siloed / Poorly Integrated]`
    *   **Refinement Notes:** `[e.g., "Link between magic system's resource cost (Alethic) and world economy (Economic State) could be much stronger." or "Social impact of environmental hazards feels underdeveloped."]`

*   **Criterion: Functional Integration of Unique Elements**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** Do the world's most unique or defining elements (e.g., Chrono-Tech, Aberrations, specific factions) serve clear functions within the narrative and world system, or do they feel like isolated 'cool ideas' or aesthetic 'wallpaper'?
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Refer to Functional Integration Audit in previous protocol. Do key elements impact multiple systems? Are they essential?]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Rate: Elements Highly Functional / Mostly Functional / Some Decorative Elements / Significant 'Wallpaper']`
    *   **Refinement Notes:** `[e.g., "The 'Whispering Vents' location needs a clearer authenticated function or connection to core mysteries/hazards." or "Ensure the specific *type* of Automaton used has implications beyond generic robot labor."] `

*   **Criterion: Emergent Complexity**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** Does the interaction of established rules and entities generate interesting, perhaps unexpected, but logically consistent complexities (e.g., social dynamics, economic niches, unique strategies for survival/power)?
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Can you point to examples where simple rules lead to complex outcomes? e.g., Strict information control leading to sophisticated code languages; resource scarcity leading to unique salvage-based technologies.]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Rate: Rich Emergence / Moderate Emergence / Limited Emergence / Overly Simple System]`
    *   **Refinement Notes:** `[e.g., "Explore the unintended social consequences of widespread memory alteration tech more fully." or "Consider the ecological niche Aberrations might occupy beyond just being monsters."]`

*   **Overall Richness Judgment:** Does the world feel like a complex, multi-layered system with depth, or relatively superficial?
    *   `[Provide summary judgment, e.g., "Possesses strong systemic richness regarding politics and tech, but ecological and deeper cultural interconnections could be enhanced."]`

*   **# Self-Critique Prompt:** *Could a significant element be removed without the rest of the system fundamentally changing? If so, its integration might be weak. Where can you weave tighter connections?*

## III. Evaluation of Originality (Systemic & Synthesis Focus)

*Purpose: To assess originality based not just on novel concepts, but on the unique synthesis, modification, and coherent integration of elements within the world's specific architecture.*

*   **Criterion: Originality of Synthesis**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** Even if using familiar elements (tropes, archetypes), does the *specific combination* and *interaction* of these elements within Aethelgard's unique ruleset create a system that feels distinct and operates in a novel way?
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Refer to Trope Recombination Protocol. Where do standard tropes function differently due to Aethelgard's specific modalities or history? Where does the blend create unique dynamics (e.g., Chrono-Noir)?]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Rate: Highly Original Synthesis / Moderately Original / Familiar Combination / Feels Generic]`
    *   **Refinement Notes:** `[e.g., "The synthesis creating Chrono-Noir is strong. The political Guild structure, while functional, currently feels less uniquely synthesized – could benefit from stronger ideological differentiation rooted in time/memory themes."] `

*   **Criterion: Modification of Familiar Tropes**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** Where familiar tropes *are* used, have they been sufficiently **modified and recontextualized** by authenticated world-specific properties or rules to feel fresh and integral, rather than simply imported?
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Review Trope Integration analysis. Does the 'Amnesiac Detective' function differently due to Memory Keepers? Does 'Steampunk Tech' have unique limits due to Chrono-Dust? ]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Rate: Tropes Highly Adapted / Moderately Adapted / Tropes Feel Standard / Tropes Feel Out of Place]`
    *   **Refinement Notes:** `[e.g., "Need to further define how Undercity Salvager tropes are specifically shaped by *temporal* hazards, not just standard ruin-delving."]`

*   **Criterion: Coherence as Originality**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** Does the sheer **internal consistency and logical rigor** across the complex world system represent a significant creative achievement in itself, regardless of component novelty?
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Reflect on the success of maintaining coherence across modalities, history, states, and entities as evaluated in Section I & II.]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Acknowledge the creative value derived from the world's structural integrity.]`

*   **Overall Originality Judgment:** Considering both premise and system, how truly unique and creatively realized does this heterocosm feel?
    *   `[Provide summary judgment, e.g., "While utilizing some familiar genre elements, the originality arises strongly from the unique synthesis centered on temporal instability and memory, and the high degree of internal systemic coherence planned."]`

*   **# Self-Critique Prompt:** *Forget novelty for a moment. Does the world feel *well-built* and *functionally unique* in how its parts work together? Where does its core structural identity lie?*

## IV. Evaluation of Thematic Resonance via Structure

*Purpose: To assess how effectively the world's fundamental architecture (modalities, history, systems) embodies and explores the core themes, valuing structural resonance.*

*   **Criterion: Structural Embodiment of Themes**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** For each core theme, can you point to specific **authenticated world structures** (laws, historical patterns, social divisions, environmental realities) that directly explore or symbolize that theme?
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Refer to Thematic Resonance Protocol. Review how modalities, history, social/environmental structures link to themes like Memory/Identity, Order/Chaos, etc.]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Rate: Themes Deeply Embedded / Moderately Embedded / Superficially Linked / Weak Thematic Structure]`
    *   **Refinement Notes:** `[e.g., "Memory/Identity and Order/Chaos deeply embedded. Legacy theme needs stronger links to *specific*, consequential historical choices beyond the Shattering itself."] `

*   **Criterion: Resonance Through Interplay**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** Do the **interactions between different world systems** naturally generate thematic questions or commentary?
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Review Systemic Interplay analysis for emergent thematic resonance (e.g., Tech vs. Environment exploring Progress risks; Info Control vs. Personal Quest exploring Truth/Identity).]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Rate: Strong Emergent Themes / Moderate / Limited / Systems Interact Without Clear Thematic Resonance]`
    *   **Refinement Notes:** `[e.g., "The interplay between Guild politics and Chrono-Tech ethics strongly resonates. Could more explicitly link environmental decay to specific past Guild decisions to strengthen Legacy/Consequence theme."] `

*   **Criterion: Implicit vs. Explicit Thematics**
    *   **Self-Critique Question:** Does the world allow themes to emerge organically from its functioning, inviting interpretation? Or does it rely heavily on explicit authorial statements or characters explaining the themes?
    *   **Evidence Check:** `[Review planned narrative moments vs. background world structure. Where does the meaning primarily reside?]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Rate: Primarily Structural/Implicit / Good Balance / Relies Heavily on Explicit Statement]`
    *   **Refinement Notes:** `[e.g., "Aim for more 'showing' of themes through systemic consequences and character navigation of world rules, reducing reliance on direct thematic exposition in dialogue."] `

*   **Overall Thematic Resonance Judgment:** How effectively does the world's architecture serve as a vehicle for exploring its intended core ideas?
    *   `[Provide summary judgment, e.g., "The world structure strongly supports core themes of Memory and Order/Chaos through multiple integrated systems. Legacy theme could be architecturally deepened."]`

*   **# Self-Critique Prompt:** *If you removed all explicit thematic statements, would the core themes still be clearly discernible purely through the way the world is built and functions? Where are the structural weak points thematically?*

## V. Final Architectural Review & Action Plan

*Purpose: Synthesize the evaluation and define concrete steps for refinement based on the critical self-assessment.*

*   **Summary of Strengths:** `[List key areas where the world excels based on the criteria above: e.g., Strong internal logic of Chrono-Tech; unique Chrono-Noir synthesis; deep embedding of Memory theme; high potential for conflict generation.]`
*   **Summary of Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:** `[List key areas needing refinement: e.g., Need clearer consequences for deontic violations; strengthen systemic links for minor factions/tropes; bolster historical causality links to present economy; reduce extraneous complexity in System X; ensure sensory details consistently reinforce themes/states.]`
*   **Prioritized Action Items:** `[List concrete, actionable steps based on the weaknesses identified, linking back to specific Codex protocols or narrative elements, e.g., 1. Revise HIST_Event_FirstParadox consequences in Global States Protocol. 2. Add specific economic properties for Unguilded in Entity Protocol reflecting Automaton labor impact. 3. Define clearer rules/sensory signature for Aberration emergence. 4. Simplify internal politics of Minor Guild Y or integrate more functionally.]`
*   **Overall Confidence Level:** `[Assess readiness for narrative implementation based on structural integrity and coherence, e.g., High Confidence in core structure, Moderate Confidence pending specific refinements.]`

*   **# Final Sanity Check:** *Does this heterocosm, as currently designed and authenticated, feel like a world you yourself would find compelling, believable (on its own terms), and rewarding to explore deeply as a reader or player? Does its architecture hold up under scrutiny?*

```

**How to Use This Self-Critique Protocol:**

1.  **Honest Assessment:** Approach this critically. The goal is to identify weaknesses *before* they become major problems in narrative development or audience reception.
2.  **Evidence-Based:** Ground your assessments in the actual details authenticated in your other Codex documents. Don't rely on vague feelings; point to specific rules, histories, or properties.
3.  **Prioritize:** Focus on the most fundamental aspects first (Modalities, Core History/State links). Address major inconsistencies before minor details.
4.  **Actionable Outcomes:** Ensure the "Action Items" are concrete tasks you can actually perform to revise your Codex or narrative plans.
5.  **Iterative Tool:** This isn't necessarily a one-time final check. Use it periodically during development, especially after major world changes or narrative arcs are planned, to ensure the architecture remains sound.

By applying these critical criteria derived from Doležel's framework to your own creation, you move towards mastering the complex art of building fictional worlds that are not just imaginative, but also possess the structural integrity, systemic richness, and resonant depth that define the most enduring heterocosms.
