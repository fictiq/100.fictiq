Okay, Artist of Worlds, this Markdown document template is designed to help you **apply Doležel's analytical methodology to your *own* world during the creation and refinement process**. It adapts the "Analyst's Toolkit" (from Section VII of the previous synopsis, which summarizes the procedures implied by III.B.V.VII) into a **Creator's Self-Analysis and Verification Protocol**.

The purpose is to use these rigorous analytical steps not just to *understand* a finished world, but to actively *build* and *verify* the coherence and structure of your *own* heterocosm as you create it. It helps you think like a critical analyst *while* you are designing.

# Story World Codex: Creator's Self-Analysis & Verification Protocol
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica (Applying the Analyst's Toolkit to Creation)

**World:** [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]
**Codex Version:** [e.g., 0.1 - Self-Analysis Framework]
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Lead Architect(s):** [Your Name / Studio Name]

## Introduction: Analyzing Your Own Architecture

*This protocol adapts the analytical methodology derived from Doležel's framework for use by **you, the creator**, during the world-building process. It provides a structured way to critically examine the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm *as you define it*, ensuring its components are clearly authenticated, logically structured, systemically integrated, and internally coherent.*

*By applying these "Analyst's Toolkit" procedures to your own creation, you can proactively identify weaknesses, strengthen connections, clarify rules, and ensure the resulting world possesses the structural integrity necessary for compelling narrative and deep immersion. Treat this as a rigorous self-review process.*

## Procedure 1: Authentication Audit (Verifying Your World's Facts)

*Purpose: To systematically review and confirm *how* key facts about your world are being established (authenticated) within your primary design documents (Codex, narratives, etc.) and assess the clarity and reliability of that authentication.*

*   **Element Under Review:** `[Identify a specific key fact, rule, entity property, historical event, or global state, e.g., "The existence and basic function of Chrono-Viewers"]`
    *   **Primary Authentication Source(s):** `[List where this is primarily defined/shown, e.g., Codex Tech Spec OBJ_ChronoViewerMk3; Narrative Scene S1E2 description/use; Dialogue mentioning limitations.]`
    *   **Mode of Authentication:** `[Is it primarily via Direct Statement (narrator/Codex), Consistent Depiction (shown in action), Reliable Character Testimony, In-World Document, Implicit Necessity, etc.? e.g., Mix of Tech Spec (Direct Statement) and Narrative Depiction.]`
    *   **Authority/Reliability of Source(s):** `[Is the source clear and authoritative within your established canon? e.g., Codex Spec = Tier 1 Authority; Narrative depiction = Tier 1; Character dialogue about *advanced* functions might be less reliable.]`
    *   **Clarity & Ambiguity:** `[Is the authentication clear and unambiguous? Or is there intentional/unintentional ambiguity? e.g., Basic function clear; exact energy cost might be slightly ambiguous across different narrative mentions.]`
    *   **Consistency Check:** `[Does this authentication conflict with any *other* authenticated facts in the Codex/narratives? e.g., Ensure depicted usage doesn't contradict stated limitations in Tech Spec.]`
    *   **Action Item (If Needed):** `[e.g., Add precise energy cost to Codex Tech Spec for absolute clarity; Ensure all narrative depictions strictly adhere to authenticated limits.]`

*   **(Repeat this audit for other crucial world facts, rules, properties, and historical events. Prioritize foundational elements.)**

*   **# Self-Audit Prompts:**
    *   *If a collaborator asked "Where is it *proven* in our canon that X is true?", could you easily point to the specific, authoritative authentication(s)?*
    *   *Are you relying too heavily on implicit authentication for core rules that need explicit clarity?*
    *   *Are there elements where the source of authentication is unclear or potentially unreliable within the fiction?*

## Procedure 2: Entity Constitution Review (Analyzing Property Bundles)

*Purpose: To apply the property taxonomy systematically to your key entities, ensuring they are multifaceted, coherently defined, and respecting undersaturation.*

*   **Entity Under Review:** `[Entity Name/ID, e.g., CHAR_Rust]`
    *   **Taxonomic Property Checklist & Assessment:**
        *   `- Physical Properties Authenticated?` `[Yes/No/Partially. Notes: e.g., Strong visual (scars, patched gear), characteristic smell defined. Tactile details undersaturated.]`
        *   `- Functional Properties Authenticated?` `[Yes/No/Partially. Notes: e.g., Core skills (Salvage, Jury-Rigging, Undercity Navigation) well-defined. Specific combat limitations less clear.]`
        *   `- Psychological Properties Authenticated?` `[Yes/No/Partially. Notes: e.g., Core traits (Pragmatic, Loyal-to-Crew, Distrustful) established via action/dialogue. Deeper motivations/beliefs need more explicit authentication.]`
        *   `- Social/Relational Properties Authenticated?` `[Yes/No/Partially. Notes: e.g., Role (Crew Leader), Status (Respected/Feared in sector), Key Relations (Kaelen, rival crews) defined. Broader network undersaturated.]`
        *   `- Modal Properties Authenticated?` `[Yes/No/Partially. Notes: e.g., None currently authenticated; operates under standard Undercity human constraints.]`
        *   `- Axiological Properties Authenticated?` `[Yes/No/Partially. Notes: e.g., Embodies Undercity values (Survival, Resourcefulness); Reputation defined.]`
        *   `- Historical Properties Authenticated?` `[Yes/No/Partially. Notes: e.g., Authenticated as survivor of specific past Undercity conflict; Detailed origin remains undersaturated.]`
    *   **Bundle Coherence Check:** `[Do the authenticated properties across categories form a logical, consistent whole? Any internal contradictions? e.g., High resourcefulness aligns with survivalist background. Distrust aligns with world state. Seems coherent.]`
    *   **Multifacetedness Assessment:** `[Does the bundle feel sufficiently complex and defined across enough dimensions for the entity's narrative role? e.g., Yes, Rust is defined functionally, socially, psychologically, physically.]`
    *   **Undersaturation Check:** `[Are the undefined areas (e.g., deeper motives, full history) intentional gaps serving mystery/future development, or unintentional omissions? e.g., Intentionally leaving full history vague for now.]`
    *   **Action Item (If Needed):** `[e.g., Add brief internal monologue or dialogue revealing a core belief motivating Rust's distrust of the Surface. Define specific combat limitations/style.]`

*   **(Repeat this review for other key characters, crucial objects, significant locations, etc.)**

*   **# Self-Audit Prompts:**
    *   *For this entity, which property category is most heavily authenticated? Which is least? Does this align with its intended role?*
    *   *Can you clearly articulate the entity's essence based *only* on its authenticated property bundle?*
    *   *Are there any "generic placeholder" properties that could be replaced with more world-specific, authenticated details?*

---

## Procedure 3: Relational Network Mapping & Verification

*Purpose: To explicitly map and verify the coherence of the key relationships structuring the world.*

*   **Relationship Under Review:** `[Identify a key relationship, e.g., Chronometers Guild <-> Gearwrights Guild]`
    *   **Authenticated Nature:** `[e.g., Primary Rivalry (Political/Economic); Mutual Dependency (Gearwrights need Dust Cores, Chronometers need specialized Gearwright mechanisms); Historical Basis (Founding Compact disputes).]`
    *   **Key Authenticated Interactions:** `[List examples: e.g., Price negotiations over Dust Cores; Industrial espionage attempts; Blocking each other's proposals in Council; Public accusations via chronocasts.]`
    *   **Connecting Properties:** `[How do the authenticated properties of *each faction* influence this relationship? e.g., Chronometer secrecy vs. Gearwright pragmatism; Both value control/profit.]`
    *   **Consistency Check:** `[Are the depicted interactions consistent with the authenticated nature of the relationship and the properties/goals of the factions involved? e.g., Yes, interactions consistently reflect tense rivalry and dependency.]`
    *   **Action Item (If Needed):** `[e.g., Need to authenticate *specific* past events that escalated the rivalry beyond generic competition.]`

*   **Relationship Under Review:** `[e.g., Aethelgard City (Surface) <-> The Undercity]`
    *   **Authenticated Nature:** `[e.g., Spatial (Above/Below); Political (Surface Control vs. UC Autonomy); Social (Prejudice/Fear vs. Resentment/Independence); Economic (Salvage Flow vs. Resource Denial).]`
    *   **Key Authenticated Interactions:** `[e.g., Watch patrols at access points; Black market trade; Occasional Surface expeditions; Undercity resistance to interference.]`
    *   **Connecting Properties:** `[e.g., Surface value of Order vs. UC value of Survival; Environmental hazards of UC influencing Surface policy; Historical Collapse shaping current boundaries.]`
    *   **Consistency Check:** `[Are the interactions depicted consistent with the complex blend of dependency, fear, and autonomy authenticated for this relationship?]`
    *   **Action Item (If Needed):** `[e.g., Clarify the *exact* legal/political status of Undercity dwellers according to Council edicts.]`

*   **(Map and verify other crucial relationships: Character-Faction, Faction-Location, Character-Object, etc.)**

*   **# Self-Audit Prompts:**
    *   *Draw a simple network map of your key entities. Are the connections (relations) clearly defined and authenticated?*
    *   *Are there entities that seem too isolated? How could they be plausibly integrated into the network through authenticated relations?*
    *   *Does the nature of the relations logically arise from the properties of the entities being related?*

---

## Procedure 4: Macro-Structure Reconstruction & Verification

*Purpose: To synthesize authenticated information to ensure the world's overarching laws, history, and context are coherent.*

*   **Structure Under Review: Governing Modalities**
    *   **Verification Task:** Review all authenticated events, entity capabilities/limitations, and explicit rule statements. Do they consistently uphold the defined Alethic, Deontic, Axiological, and Epistemic modalities for Aethelgard?
    *   **Assessment:** `[e.g., Alethic limits on Chrono-Tech appear robustly enforced across examples. Deontic clash between Guild/Undercity is consistent. Axiology needs sharper definition in some areas. Epistemic uncertainty well-established.]`
    *   **Action Item (If Needed):** `[e.g., Add Codex entry clarifying specific points of Guild Axiology.]`

*   **Structure Under Review: Authenticated History**
    *   **Verification Task:** Review the Master Timeline and key historical event descriptions. Are dates consistent? Do causal links between events hold up? Does the history logically lead to the authenticated present state?
    *   **Assessment:** `[e.g., Core timeline consistent. Causality from Shattering -> Dark Years -> Reconstruction -> Guild Power seems sound. Specific consequences of mid-Reconstruction events need clearer links to present.]`
    *   **Action Item (If Needed):** `[e.g., Write short lore entries detailing impact of HIST_Event_X on specific Guild policies still active today.]`

*   **Structure Under Review: Global State Coherence**
    *   **Verification Task:** Review the authenticated Global States for the narrative 'Now'. Are the different aspects (Political, Social, Economic, Environmental) internally consistent and plausible *in combination*?
    *   **Assessment:** `[e.g., High political tension aligns with economic strain and social division. Pervasive environmental hazards justify strong Guild control attempts. System feels coherent.]`
    *   **Action Item (If Needed):** `[N/A]`

*   **# Self-Audit Prompts:**
    *   *Can you state the 3 most important 'laws' of your world (in terms of possibility/impossibility)? Are they *never* violated without consequence/explanation in your narratives?*
    *   *Can you draw a clear line of cause-and-effect from your most important historical event to at least two different aspects of the present Global State?*
    *   *Do the different 'systems' of your world (magic, tech, politics, economy) feel like they logically belong in the same universe and interact plausibly?*

## Procedure 5: Systemic Interplay & Final Coherence Audit

*Purpose: To perform a final check on the integration of all layers, ensuring the heterocosm functions as a unified system.*

*   **Interplay Checkpoint:** `[Select a complex planned scenario involving multiple entities, rules, and contextual factors.]`
    *   **Scenario:** `[e.g., Kaelen attempts to access a restricted Memory Keeper archive located in a temporally unstable Undercity sector, pursued by Gearwright automatons acting on potentially falsified Guild intel.]`
    *   **Consistency Analysis:** `[Walk through the scenario step-by-step, checking each action/outcome against authenticated properties, relations, modalities, history, and states. Does Kaelen have the skills/tools? Are the Archive defenses consistent? Is the instability effect plausible? Are automaton capabilities/limitations respected? Is the political motivation coherent?]`
    *   **Assessment:** `[Identify any points where the scenario requires violating established rules or assuming unauthenticated properties/relations.]`
    *   **Action Item (If Needed):** `[e.g., Scenario requires Kaelen bypassing security beyond his authenticated skill level - need to introduce authenticated assistance (e.g., from Rust) or modify the security system's authenticated properties.]`

*   **(Perform similar checks for other key scenarios or potential interactions)**

*   **Final Coherence Verdict:** `[Based on all preceding checks, provide a final assessment of the world's overall internal coherence and structural integrity.]`
    *   `[e.g., The Aethelgard heterocosm demonstrates strong structural coherence based on current authentication, with clear interplay between its core systems. Identified minor inconsistencies have been flagged for resolution via Codex updates and narrative refinement. Ready for further development with continued vigilance regarding authentication.]`

*   **# Self-Audit Prompt:** *Imagine explaining the core logic of your world to someone unfamiliar with it. Can you present a consistent, integrated picture where the rules, history, inhabitants, and environment all logically connect? Where do the explanations feel weak or hand-wavy?*
