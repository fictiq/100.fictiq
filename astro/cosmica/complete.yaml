# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol serves as a final review and synthesis of the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm, 
    drawing upon Doležel's concept of the world's architecture being completed through the 
    comprehensive scope of constitutive predication. Having defined individual entities, 
    governing modalities, global states, and authenticated history using previous protocols, 
    this document prompts a holistic assessment.
  focus: |
    Ensure all authenticated elements work together systemically, creating a coherent, 
    engaging, and narratively potent semantic universe consistent with the established 
    World Identity and Design Philosophy. Check for structural integrity, thematic resonance, 
    and overall completeness (within intentional undersaturation limits).

# --- I. Confirmation of Core Identity & Thematic Resonance ---
core_identity_confirmation:
  purpose: |
    Verify that the constructed world elements collectively embody the intended core identity 
    and effectively explore the primary themes.
  review_points:
    - point: "Alignment of Tone & Style with Authenticated Details"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Yes, Chrono-Noir/Hopeful Decay evident in sensory details, descriptions. Some areas might need minor tonal shifts.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Review Brass Market descriptions for consistent noir atmosphere.]"
    - point: "Effectiveness of Structures & Conflicts in Exploring Themes"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Memory/Identity (Memory Keepers), Order/Chaos (Guilds/Undercity), Legacy (Shattering), Time (Chrono-Tech) well-explored. Progress/Preservation theme could be stronger via specific historical conflict.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Authenticate a historical event related to early anti-Chrono-Tech sentiment.]"
    - point: "Overall Alignment with Core Concept"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Yes, blend of steampunk, temporal mechanics, noir investigation feels cohesive.]"
  reflection_prompt: |
    Looking at the world holistically, does it powerfully evoke the central ideas and feelings 
    you set out to explore? Where are the strongest thematic resonances? Are there major disconnects?

# --- II. Systemic Coherence & Interplay Review ---
systemic_coherence_review:
  purpose: |
    Ensure the different layers of the heterocosm (History, Global State, Entities, Modalities) 
    interact logically and consistently, forming a believable system.
  review_points:
    - point: "History -> Global State Causality"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Shattering/Dark Years -> Guild dominance = Strong. Undercity Collapse -> Undercity mistrust = Clear. First Paradox -> Chronometer Policy = Needs clearer textual link.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Add specific predicates to Global States Protocol linking current Chronometer research limits directly to HIST_Event_FirstParadox.]"
    - point: "Global State -> Individual Entity Constraints/Enablement"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Environmental/Social constraints on inhabitants consistent. Impact of Automaton labor on human Unguilded needs more explicit properties/states.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Add 'Economic State' predicate re: human unemployment; ensure relevant character profiles reflect this.]"
    - point: "Individual Predication -> World Reflection"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Sensory details reflect status well. Automaton glitches hint at themes/tech limits. Need more character beliefs reflecting contested histories.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Review key character profiles; add authenticated beliefs about contested historical events.]"
    - point: "Modal Consistency Across Levels"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Alethic (Chrono-Tech limits) mostly consistent. Deontic (Guild vs. Undercity codes) strong source of conflict. Axiological (order vs. progress) present, could be sharpened via motivations.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Ensure character motivations explicitly tie to defined world values. Double-check plot ideas against alethic limits.]"
    - point: "Overall System Health Assessment"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Systemic links (Resource->Politics->Tech->Society) feel robust and interconnected.]"
  reflection_prompt: |
    Where are the strongest systemic links? Weakest? Are there glaring internal contradictions across layers?

# --- III. Authentication & Undersaturation Audit ---
authentication_audit:
  purpose: |
    Review the clarity of authentication (distinguishing world-facts from beliefs/rumors) 
    and the strategic use of incompleteness (undersaturation).
  review_points:
    - point: "Clarity of Authentication Status"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Mostly clear. Status of Artificer legends needs explicit flagging - myth vs. authenticated fragment?]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Add explicit Authentication Status notes to key legends in History Protocol.]"
    - point: "Source Reliability Definition"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Hierarchy (Narrator > Guild Records > Character Beliefs > Undercity Folklore) seems consistently established. Memory Keepers flagged as potentially unreliable.]"
    - point: "Strategic Undersaturation Effectiveness"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Core mysteries effective hooks. Daily life details undersaturated, allowing flexibility/creativity. Aberration emergence feels *too* undefined - needs *some* authenticated constraint.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Define 1-2 authenticated trigger conditions/patterns for Aberrations, keep origin mysterious.]"
    - point: "Identification of Unintended Gaps"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Economics outside Guilds need more grounding. Inter-Guild communication protocols unclear.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Add predicates to Global States re: artisan economy; define basic Guild comms methods.]"
  reflection_prompt: |
    Does the balance between defined fact and intriguing mystery feel right? Is the audience given 
    enough solid ground? Is it clear *why* certain things are unknown within the world?

# --- IV. Narrative Potential & Engagement Review ---
narrative_potential_review:
  purpose: |
    Assess the world's designed capacity to generate compelling narratives and foster deep 
    audience engagement (exploration, speculation, creativity).
  review_points:
    - point: "Strength of Story Engines"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Foundational Conflicts (Guilds, Undercity, Mysteries, Tech Risk) seem potent and renewable.]"
    - point: "Narrative Elasticity (Genre/Scale)"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Robust support for intended range: Noir, Thriller, Horror, Adventure, Sci-Fi; Personal to Epic scales seem viable.]"
    - point: "Effectiveness of Engagement Hooks"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., Strong mysteries, sensory clue potential high, explorable zones defined, undersaturation invites creativity.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Seed a few more specific 'discoverable artifact' concepts with partial histories.]"
    - point: "Transmedia Synergy Potential (If Applicable)"
      assessment_notes: "[e.g., World facets align well with planned platform strengths (Game=Undercity/Tech, TV=Politics, Novel=History).]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Map specific cross-platform hooks more explicitly in Transmedia Strategy section.]"
  reflection_prompt: |
    As a creator, do you see multiple compelling stories here? As a fan, are there enough mysteries 
    and details to sustain long-term engagement and theorizing?

# --- V. Overall Architectural Assessment ---
overall_assessment:
  purpose: |
    A final holistic judgment on the state of the heterocosm's construction, summarizing 
    strengths, weaknesses, and readiness for narrative development.
  strengths: "[e.g., Unique Chrono-Noir atmosphere, compelling core mysteries, strong systemic links (environment/society), rich sensory potential, clear Guild structures.]"
  weaknesses_refinement_areas: "[e.g., Need clearer Aberration rules, motivations for minor Guilds underdeveloped, non-Guild economics vague, some historical consequences need stronger links to 'Now'.]"
  completeness_rating_conceptual: "[e.g., Core structure 90% complete. Requires refinement in specific sub-systems (Aberrations, minor factions). Ready for initial narrative development.]"
  readiness_for_narrative_dev: "[e.g., Yes, core narratives can proceed based on this foundation; further Codex refinement can occur concurrently or address issues raised by narrative development.]"
  final_reflection_prompt: |
    Does this heterocosm feel like a unified, purposeful creation? Does it successfully embody 
    the core vision? Is it ready to be inhabited by compelling stories?
