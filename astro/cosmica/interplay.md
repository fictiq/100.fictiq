**World:** [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]
**Codex Version:** [e.g., 0.1]
**Focus:** Analyzing the dynamic connections between History, Global State, and Individual Entities for the timeline around [Specify Era/Year, e.g., Year 312 AR]
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

## Introduction: Mapping the Heterocosmic System

*This protocol facilitates a systemic analysis of the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm, focusing on the crucial interplay between its authenticated history, its present global state of affairs, and the properties/actions of its individual inhabitants (persons, objects, places, etc.). Following Doležel, we understand the world not as isolated layers but as an integrated system where these elements constantly influence each other through textually authenticated causal links and constraints.*

*Use this document to explicitly trace these connections, ensuring internal coherence and deepening the world's perceived reality and narrative potential. Refer back to your Historical Authentication, Global States, and Entity Profile documents.*

## I. History Shaping the Present Global State

*Purpose: Identify key authenticated historical events/eras and trace their direct, authenticated consequences on the current Global State of Affairs.*

*   **Historical Event/Era ID:** `[e.g., HIST_Event_UndercityCollapse]`
    *   **Core Authenticated Fact:** `[e.g., Sector Gamma-7 catastrophically collapsed inwards (~180 AR), area became hazardous Deep Undercity.]`
    *   **Resulting Predicated Global State(s) in 'Now' (Year 312 AR):**
        *   `- Political State: Strict regulations and Guild control *exist* over Undercity access points.`
        *   `- Social State: Deep mistrust *persists* between Surface dwellers and Undercity Salvagers.`
        *   `- Environmental State: Persistent temporal instability *is documented* in sectors adjacent to the Collapse zone.`
        *   `- Economic State: A thriving black market *deals* in potentially dangerous salvage recovered from the Collapse periphery.`
        *   `- Atmospheric State: Undercity folklore *contributes* to a general atmosphere of fear regarding deep exploration.`
    *   *# Authentication Source for Link: [e.g., Council Decrees Doc, Faction Profiles, Environmental Reports, Narrative Descriptions]*

*   **Historical Event/Era ID:** `[e.g., HIST_Era_DarkYears]`
    *   **Core Authenticated Fact:** `[e.g., Period of societal collapse, resource scarcity, and survival focus following the Shattering (~1-50 AR).]`
    *   **Resulting Predicated Global State(s) in 'Now' (Year 312 AR):**
        *   `- Social State: Strong emphasis on Guild loyalty and order *developed* as a reaction to past chaos.`
        *   `- Economic State: Hoarding mentality *persists*; robust salvage/repair culture *exists* due to past scarcity.`
        *   `- Cultural State: Significant loss of pre-Shattering knowledge *occurred*, contributing to current mysteries.`
        *   `- Psychological State (Implied): Underlying societal trauma/fear of collapse *influences* current conservatism.`
    *   *# Authentication Source for Link: [e.g., Guild Histories, Social Norms Doc, Core Mystery Doc]*

*   **(Add more Historical Event -> Present State connections)**

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *For each major historical event/era, what specific political, social, economic, or environmental conditions in the 'Now' are its direct, authenticated result?*
    *   *How does the *memory* or *interpretation* of history (potentially flawed) influence the present state?*
    *   *Are there present states that seem *disconnected* from known history? (Potential mystery or area for development).*

## II. Global State Constraining Individual Entities

*Purpose: Identify key authenticated Global States and analyze how they enable, constrain, or shape the properties, possibilities, and typical actions of individual entities.*

*   **Global State:** `[e.g., Political State: City Watch is underfunded and lacks authority in outer districts.]`
    *   **Impact on Entity Type (Example - Salvager):**
        *   *Property Enabled:* `[e.g., Property 'Operates with Impunity' in outer rings is more likely authenticated.]`
        *   *Action Constrained:* `[e.g., Seeking official justice for crimes is largely impossible/ineffective.]`
        *   *Action Enabled:* `[e.g., Establishing independent 'turf' and enforcing own rules becomes necessary/possible.]`
    *   **Impact on Entity Type (Example - Guild Merchant):**
        *   *Property Constrained:* `[e.g., Property 'Feels Secure' is diminished when traveling through outer districts.]`
        *   *Action Enabled:* `[e.g., Hiring private Guild security for transport becomes a common, authenticated behavior.]`

*   **Global State:** `[e.g., Environmental State: Frequent, unpredictable temporal distortions occur in the Undercity.]`
    *   **Impact on Entity Type (Example - Undercity Creature 'Temporal Leech'):**
        *   *Property Enabled:* `[e.g., Ability 'Phase Shift' is likely authenticated as an adaptive trait.]`
        *   *Habitat Defined:* `[e.g., Authenticated as thriving primarily within these unstable zones.]`
    *   **Impact on Entity Type (Example - Human Salvager):**
        *   *Property Constrained:* `[e.g., Long-term habitation in distortion zones is impossible due to Temporal Sickness.]`
        *   *Skill Required:* `[e.g., Property 'Skilled Navigator of Temporal Eddies' becomes a valuable, authenticated survival trait.]`
        *   *Action Constrained:* `[e.g., Predictable travel routes are impossible; mapping is difficult.]`

*   **Global State:** `[e.g., Social State: Rigid Guild hierarchy dominates access to resources and status.]`
    *   **Impact on Entity Type (Example - Unguilded Artisan):**
        *   *Property Constrained:* `[e.g., Access to high-quality Chrono-Dust or advanced tools is restricted.]`
        *   *Motivation Enabled:* `[e.g., Strong motivation to either join a Guild, find loopholes, or operate illegally is authenticated.]`
    *   **Impact on Entity Type (Example - High Guild Member):**
        *   *Property Enabled:* `[e.g., Access to exclusive information, resources, and social circles is authenticated.]`
        *   *Deontic Constraint:* `[e.g., Bound by authenticated Guild secrecy oaths and codes of conduct.]`

*   **(Add more Global State -> Individual Entity constraint/enablement analyses)**

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *How does the current political climate limit or empower different types of characters?*
    *   *How do prevailing social norms or prejudices affect characters' choices, relationships, or self-perception?*
    *   *How do economic conditions (scarcity/plenty) dictate survival strategies or ambitions?*
    *   *How do environmental hazards or features directly shape the abilities, equipment, or behaviors needed to survive/thrive?*
    *   *How does the status of tech/magic enable or restrict problem-solving within the narrative 'Now'?*

---

## III. Individual Predication Reflecting/Revealing Global States & History

*Purpose: Identify specific authenticated properties or actions of individual entities that serve to exemplify, reinforce, or reveal the broader historical context or prevailing global states.*

*   **Individual Entity Property/Action:** `[e.g., Character CHAR_OldMan_Harkness possesses deep, specific knowledge of Pre-Shattering navigation techniques.]`
    *   **Reflects/Reveals:** `[e.g., Authenticates the *existence* of such lost knowledge (Historical State); Highlights the *incompleteness* of current Guild records (Epistemic State); Establishes Harkness's connection to a potentially forgotten past (Character History linking to World History).]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Character Dialogue / Action*

*   **Individual Entity Property/Action:** `[e.g., Automaton Unit 734 exhibits memory glitches displaying fragmented images inconsistent with official Memory Keeper records.]`
    *   **Reflects/Reveals:** `[e.g., Potential unreliability or manipulation of official history (Global Epistemic/Political State); The inherent decay/imprecision of Chrono-Tech memory (Technological State); Hints at suppressed historical truths (Historical Mystery).]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Narrative Description / Plot Point*

*   **Individual Entity Property/Action:** `[e.g., Widespread visual evidence of characters wearing breathing filters in the Gearwright Quarter.]`
    *   **Reflects/Reveals:** `[e.g., Authenticates the poor air quality and industrial pollution as a tangible reality (Environmental State); Shows adaptation as a common survival strategy (Social Condition).]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Consistent Visual Description / World Art Bible*

*   **Individual Entity Property/Action:** `[e.g., A Salvager successfully bypasses a City Watch checkpoint using knowledge of forgotten Undercity tunnels.]`
    *   **Reflects/Reveals:** `[e.g., Reinforces the Watch's limited control/knowledge (Political State); Authenticates the existence and utility of the Undercity network (Geographical/Social State); Shows individual agency exploiting system weaknesses.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Plot Event*

*   **(Add more examples of individual details illuminating the macro-level)**

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *What specific character traits, skills, possessions, or scars directly point to past historical events or current global conditions?*
    *   *How do common behaviors or dialogues among 'ordinary' inhabitants reflect the prevailing social, political, or economic realities?*
    *   *How do character successes or failures in specific actions implicitly reveal the world's underlying rules (modalities) or environmental constraints?*
    *   *Can the *absence* of certain properties in individuals (e.g., lack of historical knowledge, inability to perform certain tasks) reflect a global state (e.g., censorship, technological regression)?*

## IV. Potential for Individual Impact on Macro-Level States (Authenticated Causal Links)

*Purpose: Identify narrative possibilities (or established instances) where actions of individuals or small groups are authenticated as causing significant changes to the Global State or historical trajectory.*

*   **Potential/Actual Individual Action:** `[e.g., Protagonist Investigator K- uncovers proof of Memory Keeper manipulation of historical records regarding the Undercity Collapse.]`
    *   **Potential Authenticated Impact on Global State:**
        *   `- Political State: Could trigger Council investigation, destabilize Memory Keeper Guild's power, empower rival Guilds.`
        *   `- Social State: Could cause public outcry, shift attitudes towards Undercity, undermine faith in official history.`
        *   `- Epistemic State: Would authenticate the unreliability of certain historical records, opening new avenues for discovering 'true' history.`
    *   *# Authentication Requirement: Narrative must explicitly show or state these consequences occurring as a result of K-'s actions.*

*   **Potential/Actual Individual Action:** `[e.g., A rogue Gearwright inventor perfects and releases designs for cheap, efficient atmospheric scrubbers.]`
    *   **Potential Authenticated Impact on Global State:**
        *   `- Environmental State: Could gradually improve air quality in specific districts if widely adopted.`
        *   `- Economic State: Could disrupt Guild control over environmental tech, create new industries, potentially lower healthcare costs related to pollution.`
        *   `- Political State: Could lead to conflict with established Guilds, challenge Council regulations on technology distribution.`
    *   *# Authentication Requirement: Narrative must show adoption and documentable impact.*

*   **Potential/Actual Individual Action:** `[e.g., A powerful Undercity figure unites disparate Salvager crews and successfully seals off a major Aberration emergence point.]`
    *   **Potential Authenticated Impact on Global State:**
        *   `- Environmental State: Reduces frequency/severity of Aberration attacks in nearby sectors.`
        *   `- Political State: Increases Undercity faction's influence/bargaining power with the Surface.`
        *   `- Social State: May temporarily improve Surface perception of Undercity capabilities, or increase fear of their power.`
    *   *# Authentication Requirement: Narrative must validate the sealing action and its consequences.*

*   **(Add more potential feedback loops where micro-level actions influence the macro)**

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *What kinds of individual actions (discovery, invention, leadership, sacrifice, betrayal) have the potential to significantly alter the world's established states or rules within this heterocosm?*
    *   *What conditions must be met (e.g., specific artifacts, unique abilities, political opportunity) for an individual to have such an impact?*
    *   *How would the narrative need to *authenticate* the causal link between the individual action and the global change to make it believable within the world's logic?*
    *   *Conversely, how does the world system *resist* change initiated by individuals? What are the forces of inertia?*

---

## V. Systemic Coherence Check

*Purpose: Review the identified interplays to ensure logical consistency and mutual reinforcement between history, state, and individuals.*

*   **Consistency Point 1:** `[e.g., Authenticated History of Guild rivalry aligns with current Political State of 'Cold War' and motivates individual Guild Agents' suspicious actions.]` -> `[Status: Coherent]`
*   **Consistency Point 2:** `[e.g., Authenticated Environmental State of frequent temporal anomalies justifies the Functional Property 'Temporal Stabilizer Use Skill' being valuable for individual Salvagers.]` -> `[Status: Coherent]`
*   **Consistency Point 3:** `[e.g., Authenticated Global Social State of rigid hierarchy seems slightly contradicted by an Individual Character's rapid, unexplained rise through Guild ranks.]` -> `[Status: Potential Inconsistency - Requires explanation/authentication: Is the character exceptional? Is the hierarchy less rigid than stated? Is there hidden influence? -> ACTION: Refine state definition OR justify character arc explicitly.]`
*   **Consistency Point 4:** `[e.g., Authenticated Historical Fact of 'Artificer Tech Loss' aligns with current Technological State limitations but potentially conflicts with a planned plot point involving easy rediscovery.]` -> `[Status: Potential Inconsistency - ACTION: Ensure rediscovery plot involves significant difficulty, risk, and specific authenticated prerequisites (e.g., finding a unique key), consistent with the established historical loss.]`

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *Does the current Global State logically follow from the Authenticated History?*
    *   *Are the typical properties and actions of individuals consistent with the constraints and possibilities offered by the Global State and World Laws (Modalities)?*
    *   *Do individual character backstories align with the broader Authenticated History of their culture or origin?*
    *   *Are there any points where these different layers seem to contradict each other without clear narrative justification?*

## VI. Methodological Notes for the Creator (Systemic Focus)

*   **Think Interconnectedly:** Don't design history, present conditions, and characters in isolation. Constantly ask how they influence each other.
*   **Ground Actions in Context:** When plotting character actions, consider how the authenticated history and current global state would realistically shape their choices, motivations, and chances of success.
*   **Show Consequences:** Make the past matter by showing its tangible effects on the present state. Make the present state matter by showing how it constrains or enables individual lives. Make individual actions matter by showing (where appropriate and authenticated) their ripple effects on the larger world.
*   **Use This Document for Coherence:** Refer back to this protocol during writing and world development to ensure the different layers of your heterocosm remain logically and thematically intertwined. It's a tool for systemic consistency.

**How this Markdown Template Facilitates Systemic World-Building:**

1.  **Explicit Connection Sections:** It dedicates sections specifically to tracing the causal links *from* History *to* State, *from* State *to* Individuals, and *from* Individuals *back to* State/History.
2.  **Requires Justification:** It prompts the creator not just to state connections but to consider the *authenticated basis* for those links within their world's logic.
3.  **Focus on Impact:** It emphasizes analyzing the *impact* of one layer on another (how history *results* in present states, how states *constrain* individuals).
4.  **Highlights Feedback Loops:** The section on individual impact encourages thinking about how character agency can realistically (within the world's rules) influence the macro-level, creating dynamic potential.
5.  **Systemic Coherence Check:** Provides a dedicated space to actively review and troubleshoot potential inconsistencies between the different layers of world-building.
6.  **Reinforces Grounded Creativity:** By constantly linking back to *authenticated* facts, properties, and states, it encourages creativity that builds upon the established foundation, leading to a more cohesive and believable heterocosm.

Using this protocol helps ensure that Aethelgard feels less like a collection of interesting ideas and more like a functioning, interconnected system where past, present, and individual experience are deeply intertwined, reflecting the core principles of Doležel's sophisticated approach to fictional worlds.
