# Story World Codex: Entity Constitution Protocol (Property Bundle Method)
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Bundle Ontology)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced framework for the meticulous constitution of entities** 
    within the Aethelgard heterocosm, rigorously applying Doležel's foundational principle: 
    fictional entities **ARE** nothing more or less than **complex bundles of diverse properties 
    and relations, authenticated by the authoritative narrative discourse**. This protocol guides 
    the explicit definition of these constitutive bundles, moving beyond surface description to 
    define the core semantic and operational reality of each entity.
  scope: |
    Mandatory template for defining all significant canonical entities (persons, objects, places, 
    creatures, organizations, core concepts). Ensures consistency, facilitates deep analysis, 
    and clarifies the boundaries of authenticated reality versus undersaturation.
  ontological_premise: |
    Entities possess **no inherent substance or hidden essence** beyond the sum of their 
    authenticated properties and relations as documented herein and in core narrative texts. 
    'Depth' arises from the richness, complexity, and coherence of this authenticated bundle, 
    not from analogy to Actual World entities. All properties listed require textual/Codex 
    authentication; unlisted properties are definitively **undefined** within the heterocosm.

      and the **pervasive reality of decay and temporal chaos** (Shattering legacy, Dust effects, Aberrations, 
      social breakdown). Its identity lies in this **precarious balance**, manifesting sensorially as 
      **'Hopeful Decay'**. Its core function is to serve as a **stage and crucible** for exploring themes 
      of Memory, Time, Order, and Resilience through the struggles of its inhabitants, who are themselves 
      bundles of properties reflecting this core tension (e.g., precise machines prone to glitches, 
      ordered societies built on manipulated history)."]

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for the Property Bundle Concept:

Rigorous Ontology: The Introduction explicitly states the Doležel-inspired ontology (no substance beyond properties) and the role of authentication.

Granular Property Categories: Breaks down properties into highly specific sub-categories (e.g., under Physical: Visual Manifestation, Auditory Signature, Olfactory Profile, Tactile Qualities, Gustatory Note, Atmospheric Impact).

Detailed Authentication Requirement: Mandates citing the authentication source for each significant property, reinforcing the text-centric approach.

Explicit Undersaturation Tracking: Requires listing specific undefined properties for each category, forcing conscious management of incompleteness.

Focus on Sensory Detail: Integrates sensory properties throughout all relevant categories, treating them as core constitutive elements.

Modal Properties Explicit: Includes a dedicated section for properties directly reflecting the world's modalities.

Axiological Distinction: Separates inherent modal value (if any) from perceived value within the world.

Deep Prompts: Includes prompts designed to push thinking about the nuances within each property category (e.g., "How does light interact with it?", "Does sound change with state?").

Synthesis Section: Requires summarizing the entity's "essence" as emerging from the bundle, identifying internal tensions and key undersaturated areas.

Emphasis on Function & System: Implicitly frames properties in terms of their function within the entity and the broader heterocosmic system.

This extremely detailed YAML template provides a robust framework for meticulously constructing fictional entities as complex bundles of authenticated properties, fully aligning with and operationalizing the core ontological principles derived from Doležel's Heterocosmica. It encourages depth, precision, and consistency in defining the very substance of your fictional reality.
