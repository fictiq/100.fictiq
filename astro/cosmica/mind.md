Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template specifically designed to help you define the **Psychological and Mental Properties** of sentient entities in your story world. This protocol draws directly from the principles discussed in **"C. Psychological / Mental Properties: Constituting Interiority"** within Doležel's *Heterocosmica*.

The focus here is on **consciously authenticating** the inner lives of your characters (or other sentient beings like AI, gods, creatures) through specific, textually grounded properties, rather than vague descriptions or assumptions of real-world psychology. It encourages building believable interiority from the "bundle" of authenticated traits, beliefs, motivations, and emotional states.

## Introduction: Authenticating the Inner World

*This protocol guides the definition of the **psychological and mental properties** of sentient entities within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, an entity's "inner life" – its personality, emotions, beliefs, motivations, memories – exists **only as constituted by the bundle of properties authenticated** by the authoritative narrative discourse (this Codex, core narratives).*

*Instead of assuming deep, hidden psychologies analogous to real humans, this protocol focuses on **explicitly authenticating** the key mental and emotional attributes that define the entity's character, drive its behavior, and shape its subjective experience *within the world*. Use comments `#` for nuances, potential character development paths (future authentications), or subjective perceptions *by other characters* (which authenticate the *other* character's belief, not necessarily the target's reality).*

### Psychological Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core psychological identity and its role.*

*   **Core Psychological Essence:** `[Summarize the entity's inner world based on its most defining authenticated traits, beliefs, motivations, and flaws. e.g., Kaelen is constituted psychologically by a core of cynical determination born from profound **epistemic lack** (amnesia). His **cognitive strengths** (deduction, observation) are constantly battling his **emotional disposition** (melancholy, frustration) and **social limitations** (distrust, isolation). His primary motivation (identity quest) directly engages the world's central themes and mysteries, making his internal state a microcosm of the heterocosm's fragmented reality.]`
*   **Primary Narrative Function (Psychological):** `[Define its main role based on its inner life. e.g., Driving mystery through relentless questioning; Providing specific viewpoint/ideology; Embodying thematic conflict internally; Acting as moral compass (or failing to); Undergoing significant psychological development arc.]`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (from Bundle):** `[Identify conflicts arising from clashes *within* the psychological properties. e.g., Desire for truth vs. Fear of what truth might reveal; Loyalty to code vs. Cynicism about system; Logical approach vs. Emotionally driven actions.]`
*   **Potential for Development:** `[Based on authenticated traits and undersaturated areas, where does potential for psychological change/growth lie? e.g., Overcoming cynicism through connection; Recovering key memories altering identity; Automaton developing genuine empathy.]`

**How This Markdown Document Guides Psychological Design:**

1.  **Focus on Authentication:** Explicitly demands that psychological traits, emotions, beliefs, and motivations are **authenticated** through specific textual evidence (narration, action, reliable dialogue), discouraging vague or assumed interiority.
2.  **Taxonomic Breadth:** Uses Doležel's implied categories (Traits, Emotions, Cognition, Beliefs, Motivations, Memory, Flaws) to ensure a **multifaceted psychological profile** is considered.
3.  **Distinguishes Subjective/Objective:** Helps differentiate between a character's authenticated *belief* or *subjective experience* (e.g., feeling haunted) and objective facts of the heterocosm. Important for unreliable perspectives.
4.  **Highlights Undersaturation:** Requires acknowledging undefined psychological areas, respecting the limits of textual constitution and preventing assumptions of real-world psychological completeness.
5.  **Connects Inner State to Action:** Encourages linking authenticated psychological properties directly to observable *manifestations* in behavior, dialogue, or internal monologue.
6.  **Integrates with World:** Prompts consideration of how psychological profiles interact with the world's social structures, epistemic limits, and core themes.
7.  **Provides Structure for Complexity:** Offers a systematic way to build complex, even contradictory, inner lives while maintaining clarity about what is canonically established *for that character* within the world.

By using this protocol, you can build sentient entities in Aethelgard whose inner lives feel rich, motivated, and consistent within the rules of the heterocosm, grounding their actions and thematic significance in a carefully constructed bundle of authenticated psychological properties.
