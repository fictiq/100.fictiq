# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol guides the **rigorous evaluation and reinforcement** of **internal coherence** within the 
    [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Inspired by Doležel's framework, it treats coherence – the logical 
    compatibility of all authenticated facts, rules (modalities), properties, events, states, and histories 
    *according to the world's own established principles* – not merely as the absence of error, but as a 
    **primary, demanding, and sophisticated creative achievement**. It is the bedrock of audience trust, 
    immersive believability, and meaningful narrative consequence.
  focus: |
    Systematically interrogate the world's structure for potential contradictions at all levels 
    (modal, historical, synchronic). Validate the internal logic, ensuring the heterocosm functions 
    as a believable (though not necessarily realistic), self-consistent semantic system. 
    Push beyond surface consistency to examine deep structural integrity.

# --- I. Core Modality Consistency Check (The World's Constitution) ---
core_modality_consistency:
  purpose: |
    Ensure the fundamental governing laws of the world (its 'constitution') are clearly 
    authenticated, internally compatible, and consistently applied without arbitrary exception.
  
  alethic_modality_check: # Possibility / Necessity / Impossibility (Physics, Magic, Tech Rules)
    authenticated_core_rules_summary: |
      [Summarize 2-5 absolutely fundamental alethic laws/limits, e.g., 
      1. No True Time Travel (Observation/Stutter Only). 
      2. Paradox Risk Escalates with Manipulation Scope/Duration. 
      3. Magic Requires Vitality/Sanity Cost (Specific Mechanics TBD/Detailed Elsewhere). 
      4. Aberrations Immune to Conventional Damage. 
      5. Artificer Tech Operates on Unknown Principles (Potentially Bypasses Some Current Limits).]
    consistency_interrogation:
      - question: "Are there *any* authenticated instances (plot events, character abilities, object functions) that directly contradict these core alethic limits?"
        analysis_notes: "[e.g., Initial plot idea involved Kaelen accidentally reversing time locally - DIRECT VIOLATION of Rule 1. Needs fundamental rework or justification via extremely rare/costly Artificer tech (Rule 5)."
        resolution_action: "[e.g., Rework plot point to involve replaying/observing past events, not altering them. OR Introduce specific MacGuffin with authenticated, limited rule-bending capability & high cost/risk.]"
      - question: "Are the *costs and risks* (Paradox, Vitality Drain, Sickness) associated with using magic/tech applied consistently and proportionally across different characters and situations?"
Okay, Artist of Worlds, let's convert the "Internal Coherence Protocol" into YAML and expand it with **extreme detail** and        analysis_notes: "[e.g., Protagonist seems to recover from magic drain faster than established norms for other characters. Antagonist uses powerful Chrono-Tech repeatedly without apparent Paradox risk accumulation.]"
        resolution_action: "[e.g., Justify protagonist's recovery (unique physiology? hidden artifact? – must be authenticated) OR scale more **granular checks**. This version aims to be an exhaustive tool for meticulously auditing the logical integrity of Aethelgard, treating coherence not just as a goal, but as the fundamental physics and metaphysics ensuring the heterocosm doesn't collapse under its own complexity.

      resolution_strategy: "Justify the character's ability as unique/exceptional (authenticate *why*); OR revise the ability; OR revise the world rule (major change)."

    - area: "Entity Actions vs. World Laws/States"
      question: "Are actions performed plausible given the entity's properties AND the constraints of the current global state and modalities?"
      potential_issue_example: "Character easily travels through heavily polluted/guarded zone authenticated as nearly impassable without special gear/clearance they lack."
      resolution_strategy: "Authenticate possession of required gear/clearance; OR show them using exceptional authenticated skills to overcome obstacles; OR revise zone's difficulty; OR show consequences of attempting passage unprepared."

    - area: "Inter-Compatibility of Global States"
      question: "Do different authenticated global states (e.g., political, economic, environmental) existing at the same time logically cohere or influence each other plausibly?"
      potential_issue_example: "State A: 'Booming, prosperous economy'. State B (simultaneously): 'Critical shortage of essential Chrono-Dust resource'."

conclusion:
  summary: |
    This protocol treats **internal coherence** as a deliberate creativeg., prosperity based on *hoarded* Dust creating illusion, boom is in non-Dust sectors, shortage is *imminent* but not yet fully impacting surface economy); OR revise one of the state descriptions for better alignment."

    - area: "Sensory Coherence"
      question: "Do the authenticated sensory details of different elements present at the same time create a coherent, believable atmosphere? (e.g., Does a 'silent archive' also contain descriptions of loud machinery operating nearby without explanation?)"
      potential_issue_example: "Scene describes biting cold wind (ENV State) but character is comfortably standing outside in light clothing (IND Property/Action)."
      resolution_strategy: "Add description of character's authenticated cold-resistant clothing/biology; OR revise environmental description for that moment; OR show character suffering from cold."

  prompts:
    - "Take a detailed 'snapshot' of a key scene/location. achievement born from the 
    **consistent and strategic application of textual authentication**. A coherent heterocosm, 
    where all authenticated elements function logically according to self-defined rules, provides 
    the stable foundation for audience trust, deep immersion, meaningful narrative, and resonant themes.
  final_recommendation: |
    Continuously use this protocol and the master World Bible/Codex to interrogate the structural 
    integrity of [Your Story World Name]. View consistency not as a limitation, but as the essential 
    craft that makes imaginative creation believable, functional, and enduring. Coherence is the 
    architecture that gives imagination lasting form.

How this YAML Functions:

Deep Interrogation: Uses consistency_interrogation and specific consistency_question fields under each modality/area to prompt deep, critical thinking about potential logical flaws or inconsistencies.

Focus on Mechanisms: Asks how rules are applied, how consequences manifest, how information flows, demanding analysis of the world's functional logic.

Emphasis on Justification: Repeatedly asks for justification within world rules for apparent exceptions or changes, reinforcing internal logic over authorial convenience.

Practical Examples: Includes fields for noting potential_issue_example and resolution_action, making the abstract check concrete and actionable for the creator.

Nuance Acknowledged: Recognizes complexities like power dynamics influencing rule application or the need to balance accessibility with depth.

Explicit Connection to Doležel: Frames the entire process through the lens of authentication, modalities, and the heterocosm as a semantic system requiring internal logical integrity.

Self-Reflection: Includes prompts encouraging the creator to reflect on their own process and potential biases (e.g., "Worldbuilder's Disease" check).

This extremely detailed YAML provides a rigorous framework for ensuring the Aethelgard heterocosm is not just imaginative, but possesses the profound internal coherence that Doležel identifies as a hallmark of masterful fictional creation.
