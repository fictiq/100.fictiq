Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template designed specifically to help you define the **Physical Properties and Sensory Signature** of entities within your story world. This protocol draws directly from the principles discussed in **"A. Physical Properties: The Tangible Form"** within Doležel's framework (*Heterocosmica*, Section III.B.II.A).

The focus here is on **meticulously authenticating** the perceivable, material aspects of your entities (persons, objects, places, creatures), treating these sensory details as core constitutive properties that ground your world and enhance immersion.

# Story World Codex: Physical Constitution & Sensory Profile Protocol
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.A (Physical Properties)

**World:** [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]
**Codex Version:** [e.g., 0.1 - Physical Definitions]
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]
**Lead Architect(s):** [Your Name / Studio Name]

## Introduction: Authenticating Tangible Reality

*This protocol guides the definition of the **physical and sensory properties** of entities within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Following Doležel, these properties are not mere descriptions but are **constitutive elements authenticated by the authoritative discourse** (this Codex, core narratives). They define the entity's tangible form, appearance, material nature, and how it is perceived sensorially within the world.*

*Focus on providing **specific, evocative, and consistent** physical details that ground the entity, contribute to atmosphere, align with world rules (modalities), and serve narrative/thematic purposes. Use comments `#` for details not yet firmly authenticated, subjective perceptions by others, or notes on undersaturation.*

**4. Luminosity & Light Interaction:**
   *Purpose: Define how the entity interacts with or emits light.*
    *   `- Light Emission: [e.g., No inherent luminosity; Watch numerals/hands glow faintly green after light exposure; Fungal patches emit pulsating cool blue/green light; Raw Chrono-Dust pockets shimmer faintly.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Light Reflection/Absorption: [e.g., Dull absorption by coat, sharp reflections off prosthetic/eyes; Polished casing reflects light, crystal face can glare; Dark, damp surfaces absorb most light, making area inherently gloomy.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Shadow Casting: [e.g., Casts normal human shadow; Casts small, distinct shadow; Complex structures cast deep, confusing, shifting shadows due to limited light sources.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `# Undefined: Reaction to specific temporal light frequencies.]`

**5. State of Repair, Decay, Age Appearance:**
   *Purpose: Define the entity's condition relative to wear, damage, and time.*
    *   `- Visible Age/Wear: [e.g., Appears physically mid-30s but eyes look older/haunted; Chronometer casing heavily scratched/dented but mechanism maintained; Sector shows centuries of decay, collapse, and partial, crude salvage efforts.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Specific Damage: [e.g., Prosthetic has noticeable repair welds; Crystal face has one significant crack; Specific walkways/structures authenticated as recently collapsed or near-collapse.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Evidence of Maintenance/Repair: [e.g., Kaelen's coat meticulously patched; Watch mechanism kept clean/oiled despite external wear; Sporadic, functional but ugly repairs visible (bolted plates, makeshift supports) in ruins.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Temporal Decay Effects (if any): [e.g., No visible effects on Kaelen (yet?); Metal shows faint temporal corrosion patterns near crystal; Certain areas exhibit visual 'stuttering' or physical degradation inconsistent with normal decay.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `# Undefined: Exact age of Kaelen; Full history of watch repairs; Precise rate of temporal decay in Sector Gamma.]`

**6. Sensory Attributes (Passive Emanations - Sound, Smell, Taste):**
   *Purpose: Define the inherent sensory signature beyond visual appearance.*
    *   `- Ambient Sound: [e.g., Soft click/whir from prosthetic joints; Faint, regular ticking (if wound); Pervasive silence broken by dripping water, distant rumbles, skittering sounds, wind whistling through ruins.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Ambient Scent: [e.g., Rain, damp wool, faint ozone; Pocket-worn metal, slight tang of lubricant; Dominant smell of mold, stagnant water, rust, dust, underlying chemical/metallic taint, sometimes ammonia (creature lairs?).]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Ambient Taste (Air Quality): [e.g., Often tastes metallic/dusty air; N/A; Air tastes heavy, damp, stale, with notes of decay and minerals.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `# Undefined: Kaelen's natural scent; Scent profile changes under extreme emotion; Exact source of all Undercity smells.]`

**7. Characteristic Movement, Posture, Physical Presence:**
   *Purpose: Define typical physical behavior and spatial presence.*
    *   `- Gait/Movement Style: [e.g., Controlled, watchful, slightly asymmetrical due to prosthetic; N/A (object); N/A (place - movement is environmental e.g., shifting debris).] ` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Typical Posture: [e.g., Often leans slightly, favors observing from shadows; N/A; N/A.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Physical Aura/Impression: [e.g., Projects quiet intensity, seems to take up less space than expected; Functional, reliable object; Oppressive, dangerous, labyrinthine environment.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `# Undefined: Kaelen's posture when relaxed (rarely seen?); Shard's interaction with gravitational fields.]`

### Physical Constitution Summary & Function:

*Purpose: Briefly synthesize the core physical identity and its role.*

*   **Core Physical Essence:** `[Summarize the defining physical/sensory traits. e.g., Kaelen is physically defined by the contrast between his worn human frame and the precise, slightly alien clockwork prosthetic, projecting quiet competence marked by past (unknown) trauma. His presence is associated with rain and ozone.]`
*   **Primary Sensory Impact:** `[Identify the dominant sense(s) affected. e.g., Primarily Visual (appearance, prosthetic) and Auditory (quiet movement, clicks).]`
*   **Functionality Derived from Physicality:** `[How do physical properties enable/constrain function? e.g., Prosthetic allows fine manipulation but is potentially vulnerable; lean build suits stealth but limits brute force. Watch's compact size allows portability. Sector Gamma's ruined state *is* its primary function as a hazardous exploration zone.]`
*   **Atmospheric/Thematic Contribution:** `[How do physicality/senses reinforce tone/theme? e.g., Kaelen's appearance reinforces Noir/Mystery. Watch's ticking reinforces Time theme. Sector Gamma embodies Decay/Chaos/Legacy.]`

**How This Markdown Document Guides Physical World-Building:**

1.  **Taxonomic Rigor:** Uses Doležel's implied categories (Form, Material, Surface, Luminosity, State, Sensory Emanations, Movement) to ensure multifaceted physical definition.
2.  **Sensory Emphasis:** Integrates specific prompts and examples for *all* relevant senses (Sight, Sound, Smell, Touch, Taste-if-applicable, Ambient Feel) within the physical description.
3.  **Authentication Focus:** Requires identifying the source validating each physical property, grounding it in the established canon.
4.  **Explicit Undersaturation:** Mandates noting undefined physical aspects, clarifying the limits of authenticated reality.
5.  **Function Link:** Includes a summary section connecting physical properties directly to the entity's narrative function, atmospheric contribution, and thematic relevance.
6.  **Evocative Language Encouraged:** While structured, the prompts encourage specific, evocative language to bring the physical descriptions to life.
7.  **Foundation for Other Properties:** Provides the concrete physical basis upon which functional, social, and other properties can be logically layered.

By using this detailed protocol, you can ensure the physical dimension of your Aethelgard heterocosm is not just described, but **meticulously constituted** with rich, consistent, and purposeful sensory detail, creating a truly tangible and immersive world for your audience.
