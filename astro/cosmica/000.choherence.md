Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template designed as a **Coherence Review Protocol** for your story world creation process. This protocol is directly inspired by the principles discussed in **"III. Coherence as a Primary Creative Achievement"** from Doležel's *Heterocosmica*.

Its purpose is to guide you in actively **assessing and reinforcing the internal consistency** of your heterocosm, treating coherence not just as error-checking, but as a fundamental goal of your creative design. It encourages you to rigorously test the logical compatibility of your world's authenticated elements (rules, history, entities, states) to ensure structural integrity and audience trust.

## Introduction: Building a Logically Sound Heterocosm

*This protocol guides the review and refinement of the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm's **internal coherence**. Following Doležel's framework, coherence arises from the **consistent application of textual authentication**, ensuring that all established facts, rules (modalities), entity properties, historical events, and global states are logically compatible *according to the world's own internal rules*. Achieving this consistency is not merely technical polish; it is a **primary creative achievement** essential for audience immersion, trust, and meaningful narrative.*

*Use this document to systematically check for potential contradictions, validate the internal logic of world systems, and ensure the heterocosm functions as a believable (though not necessarily realistic), self-consistent semantic universe.*

## I. Review of Foundational Modalities (Governing Laws)

*Purpose: Ensure the core rules of the world are clearly authenticated and consistently applied.*

*   **Modality Type: Alethic (Possibility/Necessity/Impossibility)**
    *   **Authenticated Core Rules:** `[List key authenticated rules, e.g., No true time travel, only local observation/stutter; Magic requires somatic/verbal/material components AND drains user vitality; Specific materials are indestructible; Certain species possess unique innate abilities like flight/telepathy.]`
    *   **Consistency Check:**
        *   `- Do all authenticated character abilities and technological functions adhere to these core alethic rules?`
        *   `- Are limitations (costs, risks, failure chances) applied consistently across all instances of magic/tech use?`
        *   `- Do plot events respect the established boundaries of possibility/impossibility?`
    *   **Assessment Notes:** `[e.g., Generally consistent, but need to clarify the exact 'vitality cost' mechanism for magic. Ensure the 'paradox risk' for Chrono-Tech has clearly defined potential consequences.]`
    *   **Action Items:** `[e.g., Add specific subsection to Mythology doc detailing magic cost mechanics; List potential paradox outcomes.]`

*   **Modality Type: Deontic (Obligation/Permission/Prohibition)**
    *   **Authenticated Core Rules:** `[List key authenticated laws, ethical codes, social contracts, e.g., Guild Law forbids sharing tech secrets; Salvager Code mandates mutual aid in emergencies; Religious doctrine prohibits specific actions.]`
    *   **Consistency Check:**
        *   `- Are characters who violate these rules shown facing plausible consequences (legal, social, internal guilt) consistent with the world's structure?`
        *   `- Are obligations associated with specific roles (e.g., healer, guard, priest) consistently depicted?`
        *   `- Do different factions consistently adhere to (or subvert) their stated codes?`
    *   **Assessment Notes:** `[e.g., Guild secrecy seems consistently enforced. Consequences for breaking Salvager code need more narrative examples.]`
    *   **Action Items:** `[e.g., Brainstorm plot scenario showing negative outcome of Salvager code betrayal.]`

*   **Modality Type: Axiological (Values)**
    *   **Authenticated Core Values:** `[List key values authenticated as 'good' or 'desirable' vs. 'bad' or 'taboo' within the dominant culture or specific factions, e.g., Order/Precision valued by Guilds; Survival/Resourcefulness valued by Undercity; Hubris/Uncontrolled power seen as negative.]`
    *   **Consistency Check:**
        *   `- Do character motivations generally align with pursuing authenticated values or avoiding disvalues?`
        *   `- Does the narrative framing (authoritative voice, consequences) consistently reinforce this value system?`
        *   `- Are conflicts arising from clashing value systems logically portrayed?`
    *   **Assessment Notes:** `[e.g., Guild value of Order is clear. Need to better authenticate *what* specifically constitutes 'Hubris' in relation to Chrono-Tech.]`
    *   **Action Items:** `[e.g., Add specific examples of 'Hubris' leading to negative outcomes in the historical record.]`

*   **Modality Type: Epistemic (Knowledge/Belief)**
    *   **Authenticated Core Rules:** `[List key limits on knowledge, reliability of sources, e.g., Pre-Shattering history is fragmented/unreliable; Memory Keepers control/potentially alter records; Direct observation is generally reliable, prophecy is not.]`
    *   **Consistency Check:**
        *   `- Do characters realistically struggle to obtain information authenticated as scarce or restricted?`
        *   `- Is the reliability/unreliability of different information sources consistently portrayed?`
        *   `- Do plotsOkay involving mystery or discovery adhere to the established epistemic constraints?`
    *   **Assessment Notes:** `[e.g., Consistent portrayal of difficulty accessing true history. Need to ensure characters don't suddenly 'know' things they couldn't plausibly, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template designed to help you prioritize and evaluate **Internal Coherence** during learn under the established epistemic rules.]`
    *   **Action Items:** `[e.g., Review investigative plotlines; verify information sources are consistent with world rules.]`

*   **# Prompts:**
     your world-building process, drawing directly from the principles highlighted in Doležel's framework under **"III. Coherence as a Primary Creative Achievement."**

This protocol acts as a **Coherence Checklist and Design Guide**. Its purpose is to encourage you to view internal consistency not just as error correction, but as a fundamental aspect of your creative design, essential for building a believable, immersive, and structurally sound heterocosm.

## Introduction: Designing for Logical Integrity

*This protocol guides the evaluation and maintenance of **internal coherence** within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Inspired by Doležel's framework, it treats coherence – the logical can that be resolved *within* the rules?*

---

## II. Review of Historical & Temporal Coherence

*Purpose: Ensure the authenticated past logically connects to the present and that events unfold consistently across the narrative timeline.*

*   **Consistency Check: History -> Present State:**
    *   `Does the authenticated Global State of Affairs for the narrative 'Now' logically and plausibly result from the key Authenticated Historical Events? Are the causal links clear?`
    *   *Assessment Notes:* consistency of authenticated facts, rules, and events according to the world's *own* established principles – not merely as a technical requirement, but as a **primary creative achievement** essential for audience trust, immersion, and narrative meaning.*

*Use this document proactively during design and iteratively during development to identify potential inconsistencies and ensure the world functions as a believable, self-consistent system. Remember, coherence here means internal logic, not necessarily realism.*

---

## I. Core Modality Consistency Check

*Purpose `[e.g., Strong link between Shattering/Dark Years and current Guild structures. Need to better trace economic consequences of specific past wars/disasters onto current resource distribution.]`
    *   *Action Items:* `[e.g., Add predicates to Global Economic State reflecting resource shifts caused by HIST_War_GuildSkirmish1: Ensure the fundamental governing laws of the world are applied consistently.*

*   **Modality: Alethic (Possibility/Necessity - Physics, Magic, Tech Rules)**
    *   **Authenticated Core Rules:** `[List 2-3 key established rules, e.g., "Chrono-Tech cannot reverse entropy, only slow/observe.",0.]`

*   **Consistency Check: Diachronic Entity Consistency:**
    *   `Do entities (characters, places, objects) maintain their core authenticated properties over time, unless a change is explicitly authenticated? (e.g., Does character personality remain consistent barring development? Do established locations retain their core features?)`
    *   *Assessment Notes:* `[e.g., Main character development seems well-authenticated. Need to double-check if descriptions of Aethelgard City in early chapters align with established layout in later maps/descriptions.]`
    *   *Action Items:* `[e.g., Cross-reference early city descriptions with finalized map/location profiles.]`

* "Only entities attuned to Moon Fragments can perceive Temporal Aberrations directly.", "Standard biological healing rates apply unless specific Med-Tech is used."]`
    *   **Consistency Check Questions:**
        *   Do all planned/depicted events adhere to these physical/metaphysical limits?
        *   Are the costs and limitations of magic/technology consistently enforced for *all* relevant characters/situations?
        *   Are there any 'convenient' exceptions introduced without proper in-world authentication/justification?
    *   **Potential Inconsistencies Noted:** `[e.g., Scene planned where basic Chrono-Viewer accidentally reverses local time - violates Rule 1. Character easily spots Aberration without att   **Consistency Check: Temporal Logic:**
    *   `If the world includes time travel, temporal loops, or anomalies, are the authenticated 'rules' governing these phenomena applied consistently without creating unresolvable paradoxes (unless paradox *is* the authenticated outcome)?`
    *   *Assessment Notes:* `[e.g., Localized time stutters seem consistently applied based on proximity to Dust/tech. Rules preventing major causal changes (no true time travel) are upheld. The nature of 'Lost Seconds' remains ambiguous but consistently portrayed as unpredictable.]`
    *   *Action Items:* `[e.g., Ensure any future plots involving temporal observation adhere strictly to the 'no alteration' rule.]`

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *Can you trace a clear causal line from major past events to specific present conditionsunement.]`
    *   **Resolution/Design Adjustment:** `[e.g., Revise scene: Viewer replays events, doesn't reverse. Character uses authenticated tech to detect Aberration indirectly, or establish prior attunement.]`

*   **Modality: Deontic (Obligation/Permission - Laws, Ethics, Codes)**
    *?*
    *   *Are character histories consistent with the broader world timeline?*
    *   *If you jump forward or backward in the narrative timeline, do the world and characters remain consistent with their previously authenticated states for that period?*

---

## III. Review of Synchronic Coherence (Consistency at a Single Point in Time)

*Purpose: Ensure that different elements authenticated as existing or occurring simultaneously are logically compatible according to world rules.*

*   **Consistency Check: Entity Properties vs. World Laws:**
    *   `Do the authenticated properties and capabilities of individual entities align with the world   **Authenticated Core Rules:** `[e.g., "Guild Law strictly prohibits sharing proprietary tech outside the Guild.", "Undercity 'Scavenger's Honor' mandates leaving basic survival gear for others.", "Memory Keepers are forbidden from accessing 'Sealed' historical archives."] `
    *   **Consistency Check Questions:**
        *   Are characters who violate these rules shown facing plausible consequences (legal, social, internal guilt) consistent with the world's established enforcement/values?
        *   Are permissions/obligations tied to specific roles (e.g., Guild Master, City Watch) applied consistently?
        *   Does the narrative implicitly endorse or condemn actions in alignment with these authenticated norms?
    *   **Potential Inconsistencies Noted:** `[e.g., Main character repeatedly shares Guild tech secrets with no consequences depicted's governing modalities? (e.g., Can a character possess an ability explicitly forbidden by the alethic modality? Does their social role align with the deontic structure?)`
    *   *Assessment Notes:* `[e.g., Generally yes. Need to verify if the 'Automaton Philosopher' concept truly fits within the authenticated limits of current Automaton sentience/programming, or if it requires authenticating it as a unique exception/breakthrough.]`
    *   *Action Items:* `[e.g., Refine Automaton properties in Entity Profile OR explicitly authenticate Unit 734 as anomalous.]`

*   **Consistency Check: Entity Actions vs. World Laws/States:**
    *   `Are. Powerful figure accesses Sealed Archives with no justification given.]`
    *   **Resolution/Design Adjustment:** `[e.g., Add consequences for tech sharing (pursuit, loss of status). Provide authenticated justification for archive access (special dispensation, exploiting loophole, accepting risk of punishment).]`

*   **Modality: Axiological (Values)**
    *    the actions characters perform plausible given their own properties AND the constraints of the current Global State and governing modalities? (e.g., Can a character realistically travel across a quarantined zone? Can they afford a resource authenticated as scarce?)`
    *   *Assessment Notes:* `[e.g., Character infiltration plots seem consistent with known security levels and required skills. Need to ensure resource costs for actions (e.g., activating powerful tech) align with character's established economic status.]`
    **Authenticated Core Values:** `[e.g., Order/Precision valued by Guilds; Survival/Resourcefulness valued in Undercity; Historical Truth contested/feared; Unchecked Ambition generally leads to downfall.]`
    *   **Consistency Check Questions:**
        *   Do character motivations generally align with pursuing what is valued (or reacting against what is devalued) within their cultural context?
        *   Does the narrative consistently reward/punish actions in ways that reflect the authenticated value system?
        *   Are aesthetic judgments (beauty/ugliness) applied consistently according to world standards?
    *   **Potential Inconsistencies Noted:** `[e.g., Narrative seems to reward a character's unchecked ambition without depicting negative consequences established elsewhere.]`
    *   **Resolution/Design Adjustment:** `[e.g., Ensure ambitious character faces eventual downfall OR re-evaluate/nuance the authenticated world value regarding ambition – perhaps it's only *certain kinds* of ambition that are punished.]`

*   **Modality: Epistemic (Knowledge/Belief)**
    *   **Authenticated Core Rules:** `[e.g., Pre-Shattering knowledge is fragmented*   *Action Items:* `[e.g., Add resource check points to plot outlines.]`

*   **Consistency Check: Global States Inter-Compatibility:**
    *   `Do different authenticated Global States existing simultaneously logically cohere? (e.g., Is a state of 'booming economy' compatible with an authenticated state of 'critical resource depletion' without further explanation?)`
    *   *Assessment Notes:* `[e.g., High political tension seems consistent with economic strain and social unrest. Potential dissonance between 'strict information control' and 'thriving black market for information' needs careful handling - perhaps the control *causes* the black market.]`
    *   *Action Items:* `[e.g., Add notes explicitly linking state elements, ensuring apparent contradictions are explained systemically.]`

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *Take a snapshot of the world at a key narrative moment. Do all the authenticated facts about entities, places, states, and active laws fit together logically?*
    *   *Are there any "magic bullets" or convenient solutions characters possess that seem to bypass established world constraints without justification?*
    *   *Do different systems within the world (magic, tech, politics, economy) interact in a consistent and logical way?*

---

## IV. Managing Complexity and Avoiding "Worldbuilder's Disease"

*Purpose: Ensure that the pursuit of coherence and detail serves the narrative and themes, rather than becoming an end in itself.*

*   **Complexity Check:** Is the world's authenticated structure (rules, history, factions) becoming *too* complex to be effectively conveyed within the narrative or managed consistently?
    *   *Assessment Notes:* `[e.g., The internal politics of the minor Guilds are currently overly detailed and don't serve the main plotlines. Could be simplified or relegated to appendices/future exploration.]`
    *   *Action Items:* `[e.g., Streamline minor Guild details in Codex, focus narrative on Major/unreliable; Guild communication is monitored; Aberrations cannot be fully understood by current science.]`
    *   **Consistency Check Questions:**
        *   Do characters struggle appropriately to acquire information established as rare or restricted?
        *   Is the reliability of information sources depicted consistently?
        *   Do characters act based on the knowledge plausibly available to them, or do they exhibit unexplained omniscience?
    *   **Potential Inconsistencies Noted:** `[e.g., Character easily finds complete Artificer blueprint despite knowledge being authenticated as lost/fragmented.]`
    *   **Resolution/Design Adjustment:** `[e.g., Make blueprint discovery a major quest involving piecing fragments, bypassing security, and still potentially being incomplete or misinterpreted.]`

*   **# Prompt:** *Are the fundamental rules of your world clear (even if complex) and applied without arbitrary exceptions?*

---

## II. Diachronic Consistency Check (Across Time)

*Purpose: Ensure authenticated facts, properties, and states remain stable over the narrative timeline unless changes are explicitly authenticated.*

*   **Check Area: Character Properties**
    *   **Question:** Do characters retain their core authenticated physical, psychological, and functional properties unless specific events (training, injury, magic, tech, major psychological shift) are authenticated to change them?
    *   **Potential Issue:** `[e.g., Character known for meticulous planning suddenly acts impulsively without authenticated trigger.]`
    *   **Resolution:** `[e.g., Authenticate a specific stressor causing the impulsive break OR revise action OR adjust core character property consistency.]`

*   **Check Area: Historical Facts**
    *   **Question:** Once a historical event or fact is authenticated by the primary narrative authority, is it treated as a stable part of the world's past in subsequent references? Are details consistent?
    *   **Potential Issue:** `[e.g., Narrative in Ch. 1 states the Shattering was 300 years ago; dialogue in Ch. 20 implies it was 500 years ago, with no explanation for the discrepancy.]`
    *   **Resolution:** `[e.g., Correct the inconsistency based on intended canon. OR Authenticate the Ch. 20 speaker as unreliable or referencing a different calendar.]`

*   **Check Area: Global States**
    *   **Question:** Do prevailing conditions (political climate, environmental state) remain consistent for their authenticated time period, only changing when specific events are authenticated as causing that change?
    *   **Potential Issue:** `[e.g., World described as impoverished, but characters suddenly have easy access to abundant resources without explanation.]`
    *   **Resolution:** `[e.g., Ensure resource access is justified (theft, black market, specific privileged status) OR revise description of global state OR authenticate an event that changed resource availability.]`

*   **Check Area: Object Properties/Functions**
    *   **Question:** Do key objects or technologies retain their authenticated functions, limitations, and appearances unless modified by authenticated events?
    *   **Potential Issue:** `[e.g., A Chrono-Device previously authenticated as only allowing observation suddenly enables time travel for plot convenience.]`
    *   **Resolution:** `[e.g., Adhere to limitation OR introduce a *new*, authenticated element (e.g., rare power source, Artificer upgrade) that plausibly modifies the device's function *within the established rules*.]`

*   **# Prompt:** *Imagine reading/watching your story sequentially. Would previously established facts or rules feel arbitrarily contradicted or forgotten later on?*

---

## III. Synchronic Consistency Check (At the Same Time)

*Purpose: Ensure different authenticated elements co Guild conflicts.]`

*   **Functional Detail Check:** Does every significant authenticated detail (historical fact, entity property, world rule) potentially serve a purpose (plot relevance, characterization, thematic resonance, atmosphere, establishing necessary constraints)?
    *   *Assessment Notes:* `[e.g., Detailed history of pre-Shattering currency seems irrelevant currently. Specific atmospheric sensory details strongly support tone.]`
    *   *Action Items:* `[e.g., Mark currency history as 'Tier 3 Canon/Flavor' unless a plot requires it.]`

*   **Accessibility Check:** While complex, is the world's core logic understandable enough for the audience to follow the narrative and appreciate character struggles/achievements within the established rules?
    *   *Assessment Notes:* `[e.g., Core Chrono-Tech limits are clear. Nuances of paradox risk might need clearer explanation/demonstration within the narrative itself.]`
    *   *Action Items:* `[e.g., Plan specific scenes demonstrating paradox risk consequences early on.]`

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *Is every rule necessary? Can any systems be simplified without losing essential function or flavor?*
    *   *Does the level of historical or technical detail overwhelm the narrative focus?*
    *   *How much of this detailed coherence needs to be *explicitly understood* by the audience versus simply *felt* as background consistency?*

---

## V. Conclusion: Coherence as Craft

*This review protocol treats **internal coherence** not as a happy accident or a mere absence of errors, but as a **deliberate creative achievement** resulting from the **consistent and strategic application of textual authentication**. A coherent heterocosm, where entities, laws, states, and history function together logically according to their own authenticated rules, provides the stable foundation for audience trust, deep immersion, meaningful narrative, and resonant thematic exploration.*

*Continuously use this protocol (and the master World Bible/Codex) to test the structural integrity of [Your Story World Name]. View consistency not as a limitation, but as the essential craft that makes your imaginative creation truly believable and enduring.*

**How this Markdown Document Guides Coherence:**

1.  **Systematic Checks:** Breaks down coherence into logical categories (Modalities, History, Synchronic, Complexity) for focused review.
2.  **Focus on Authentication:** Constantly frames consistency in terms of whether elements align with *authenticated* rules and facts.
3.  **Requires Evidence:** Implicitly asks the creator to justify coherence by being able to point to the established rules or facts within their Codex/Bible.
4.  **Identifies Potential Issues:** Uses prompts and assessment notes to actively look for contradictions, implausibilities (within world logic), or unnecessary complexity.
5.  **Action-Oriented:** Includes `Action Items` to translate assessment findings into concrete steps for refining the world design or narrative plan.
6.  **Values Coherence as Creative:** Explicitly frames the maintenance of internal logic as a significant part of the creative process, aligning with Doležel's perspective.

By regularly applying this kind of rigorous coherence check, you ensure that the Aethelgard heterocosm remains a tightly constructed, logically sound, and ultimately more believable and impactful fictional universe.
