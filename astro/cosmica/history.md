# Story World Codex: Historical Authentication Protocol
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.V.III

**World:** [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]
**Codex Version:** [e.g., 0.1]
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]
**Keeper of the Codex:** [Your Name/Studio Name]

## Introduction: Constructing the Past Through Authenticated Facts

*This protocol guides the definition of the historical dimension of the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Following Doležel's principles, the world's past exists only as **constituted through authenticated predication** within the narrative framework (prose, script, game design, this Codex). History is not discovered, but **textually constructed and validated**.*

*Your task is to define key historical events, eras, figures, and legacies, specifying **how** their reality is authenticated within the world and considering the reliability and accessibility of historical knowledge.*

## I. Foundational Historical Principles & Core Mysteries

*Purpose: Define the overarching historical trajectory and the central historical questions driving engagement.*

*   **Key Historical Eras (Authenticated):**
    *   `- Era Name: [e.g., The Mythic Age (Pre-Shattering)]`
        *   *Authentication Status:* `[Legendary / Fragmentary / Heavily Mythologized]`
        *   *Key Authenticated Feature:* `[e.g., Existence of 'Great Artificers'; Moon 'Aethel' was whole]`
        *   *Source of Authentication:* `[e.g., Widely known legends, disputed ancient texts]`
    *   `- Era Name: [e.g., The Shattering (Year Zero)]`
        *   *Authentication Status:* `[Fact of Occurrence Authenticated; Cause = Core Mystery]`
        *   *Key Authenticated Feature:* `[e.g., Cataclysmic event broke the moon, destabilized time]`
        *   *Source of Authentication:* `[Universal consensus, environmental evidence (crater)]`
    *   `- Era Name: [e.g., The Dark Years (~Years 1-50 AR)]`
        *   *Authentication Status:* `[Period Authenticated; Details Scarce/Contested]`
        *   *Key Authenticated Feature:* `[e.g., Societal collapse, widespread temporal storms, survival conditions]`
        *   *Source of Authentication:* `[Fragmentary accounts, Undercity folklore, negative evidence (lack of records)]`
    *   `- Era Name: [e.g., Age of Reconstruction (~Years 50 AR - Present)]`
        *   *Authentication Status:* `[Ongoing; Reasonably Well-Documented by Guilds (potentially biased)]`
        *   *Key Authenticated Feature:* `[e.g., Rise of Guilds, founding of Aethelgard, harnessing of Chrono-Dust, major documented events like Undercity Collapse]`
        *   *Source of Authentication:* `[Guild Archives, Council Records, established narratives]`

*   **Core Historical Mysteries (Intentionally Unauthenticated/Ambiguous):**
    *   `- Mystery: [e.g., The True Cause of the Shattering]`
        *   *Known Authenticated Clues:* `[e.g., Crater suggests external impact OR internal explosion; legends mention Artificer hubris; Chronometers Guild suppresses certain pre-Shattering data]`
        *   *Narrative Function:* `[e.g., Central driving mystery, potential for world-altering reveals, source of conspiracy theories]`
    *   `- Mystery: [e.g., The Full Capabilities and Fate of the Great Artificers]`
        *   *Known Authenticated Clues:* `[e.g., Existence of incredibly advanced (often non-functional) ruins; legends of their power; conflicting accounts of their disappearance/ascension/destruction]`
        *   *Narrative Function:* `[e.g., MacGuffin quests (seeking their tech/knowledge), potential for hidden descendants/survivors, explains advanced ruins]`
    *   `- Mystery: [e.g., The Nature of Pre-Shattering Society]`
        *   *Known Authenticated Clues:* `[e.g., Fragmented texts suggest utopia OR oppressive regime; architectural remnants imply different social structures; Memory Keepers present a specific, possibly sanitized, version]`
        *   *Narrative Function:* `[e.g., Thematic contrast with present, fuels ideological debates within the world, potential for uncovering 'true' past]`

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *What are the major turning points that EVERYONE in the world (who is informed) accepts as having happened?*
    *   *What are the biggest unanswered questions about the past designed to hook the audience?*
    *   *What is the general 'shape' of history (e.g., cyclical, progressive decline, slow recovery)?*

## II. Key Authenticated Historical Events

*Purpose: Detail specific, significant past events whose occurrence and basic nature are considered factual within the heterocosm.*

*   **Event ID:** `[e.g., HIST_Event_UndercityCollapse]`
    *   **Event Name:** `[e.g., The Great Undercity Collapse]`
    *   **Authenticated Date/Period:** `[e.g., Circa Year 180 AR]`
    *   **Authenticated Core Facts:** `[e.g., Sector Gamma-7 catastrophically collapsed inwards; significant loss of life; area became part of the inaccessible Deep Undercity; officially blamed on geological instability aggravated by early Chrono-Dust mining.]`
    *   **Primary Authentication Method(s):** `[e.g., Official Council Records (potentially biased explanation), Survivor Testimonies (fragmentary, archived by Memory Keepers), visible geological scarring in adjacent sectors]`
    *   **Associated Mysteries/Ambiguities:** `[e.g., Rumors of experimental Chrono-Tech tests being the true cause; whispers of something 'awakened' during the collapse; actual casualty figures disputed]`
    *   **Known Consequences / Legacy:** `[e.g., Led to stricter regulations on Undercity access/mining; fuels Undercity mistrust of Guilds; created new territory for Aberrations/Salvagers; source of ghost stories and salvage legends]`

*   **Event ID:** `[e.g., HIST_Event_FoundingCompact]`
    *   **Event Name:** `[e.g., The Founding Compact]`
    *   **Authenticated Date/Period:** `[e.g., Approx. Year 50 AR]`
    *   **Authenticated Core Facts:** `[e.g., Agreement signed by proto-Guild leaders (Chronometers, Gearwrights, early Memory Keepers); established basic resource sharing and mutual defense pacts necessary for city survival; laid groundwork for Cogwork Council.]`
    *   **Primary Authentication Method(s):** `[e.g., Preserved (possibly edited) text of the Compact in Archives; foundational myths of each Guild; Council histories]`
    *   **Associated Mysteries/Ambiguities:** `[e.g., Were other factions excluded? Were there secret codicils? How accurately does the preserved text reflect the original agreement?]`
    *   **Known Consequences / Legacy:** `[e.g., Formalized Guild power structure; source of ongoing legal/political disputes based on interpretation; symbol of fragile unity]`

*   **(Add more key events as needed: e.g., HIST_Event_FirstParadox, HIST_War_GuildSkirmish10, HIST_Discovery_RefinedDustProcess...)**

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *What wars, disasters, discoveries, political shifts, or cultural moments fundamentally shaped the world's present state?*
    *   *For each event, what core facts are universally accepted (authenticated)?*
    *   *How is knowledge of this event preserved or transmitted (records, oral history, ruins)?*
    *   *What ambiguities or conflicting accounts surround the event?*
    *   *What is its lasting impact on the world's 'Now'?*

## III. Authenticated Historical Figures & Legacies

*Purpose: Define key individuals from the past whose existence and significant actions/legacies are considered factual within the heterocosm.*

*   **Figure ID:** `[e.g., HIST_Figure_ArtificerArchitect]`
    *   **Figure Name/Title:** `[e.g., Grand Artificer Elara Vance (Legendary?)]` *(Note: May be same name as current Master Vance - deliberate ambiguity?)*
    *   **Authenticated Period:** `[e.g., Mythic Age (Pre-Shattering)]`
    *   **Authenticated Core Facts/Actions:** `[e.g., Credited in fragmented blueprints with designing the Grand Orrery; associated with early Chrono-Dust refinement theories; disappeared during/before The Shattering.]`
    *   **Authentication Method(s):** `[e.g., Guild legends (Chronometers), fragmented technical documents, architectural analysis]`
    *   **Associated Mysteries/Ambiguities:** `[e.g., True extent of her knowledge; her actual fate; relationship (if any) to current Master Vance; authenticity of documents attributed to her]`
    *   **Legacy:** `[e.g., Symbol of lost knowledge/power; figure of reverence/caution for Chronometers Guild; potential key to understanding Chrono-Tech origins]`

*   **Figure ID:** `[e.g., HIST_Figure_CouncilorMordecai]`
    *   **Figure Name/Title:** `[e.g., Councilor Mordecai the Stern]`
    *   **Authenticated Period:** `[e.g., Mid-Age of Reconstruction (~Year 150-200 AR)]`
    *   **Authenticated Core Facts/Actions:** `[e.g., Gearwright representative on early Council; known for harsh enforcement of Guild monopolies; oversaw expansion of Steamworks; mysteriously assassinated.]`
    *   **Authentication Method(s):** `[e.g., Council records, Gearwright histories (positive spin), rival Guild accounts (negative spin), City Watch cold case files]`
    *   **Associated Mysteries/Ambiguities:** `[e.g., Who assassinated him and why? Was he corrupt or merely pragmatic? Did he hide any secret projects?]`
    *   **Legacy:** `[e.g., Symbol of Guild ruthlessness for some, Gearwright efficiency for others; his unsolved murder contributes to Guild tensions; policies still impact Undercity relations]`

*   **(Add more key historical figures as needed: e.g., founders, tyrants, rebels, inventors, prophets...)**

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *Who are the legendary or historical figures whose names still resonate in the present?*
    *   *What core actions or characteristics are definitely attributed to them?*
    *   *How is their story told and authenticated? Are there competing versions?*
    *   *What mysteries remain about them?*
    *   *How does their legacy actively influence the world's 'Now'?*

## IV. Historical Knowledge: Accessibility & Reliability

*Purpose: Define the authenticated state of historical knowledge itself within the heterocosm – how is the past known, preserved, or potentially obscured? (Connects to Epistemic Modality).*

*   **Predicated State:** `[e.g., Record Keeping: History *is primarily preserved* in Guild Archives (Chronometers, Memory Keepers) using Data Crystals, but access *is restricted*. Older records *are known* to be fragmented or corrupted by time/temporal effects.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Faction Profiles, World Rules*
*   **Predicated State:** `[e.g., Dominant Historical Narrative: The Cogwork Council and Major Guilds *promote* an official narrative emphasizing post-Shattering recovery through Guild order and ingenuity, often *downplaying* the Dark Years and pre-Shattering complexities.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Political State Doc, In-World Propaganda examples*
*   **Predicated State:** `[e.g., Reliability Issues: The Memory Keepers' role in 'archiving and clarifying' *is viewed with suspicion* by many outside the Guild; rumors *persist* of deliberate alteration or suppression of inconvenient historical facts.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Faction Profile - Memory Keepers, Social Conditions Doc*
*   **Predicated State:** `[e.g., Alternative Histories: Undercity communities *preserve* distinct oral histories and folklore, often contradicting official Guild narratives, particularly regarding the Undercity Collapse and treatment by Surface authorities. Reliability *is variable* and hard to verify.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Faction Profile - Salvagers*
*   **Predicated State:** `[e.g., Lost Knowledge: Significant knowledge from the Mythic Age (Artificer tech, true cause of Shattering) *is genuinely considered lost* or exists only in perilous ruins or heavily encrypted/fragmented data inaccessible to current tech levels.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Core Mystery Doc, Technology Doc*

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *How is history recorded and preserved (written records, oral tradition, memory tech, ruins)?*
    *   *Who controls access to historical knowledge? Is it centralized or dispersed?*
    *   *How reliable are the available historical sources considered *within the world*? Are there known biases or manipulators?*
    *   *Are there significant gaps or 'dark ages' in the authenticated historical record?*
    *   *Are there competing historical narratives clashing within the world?*
*   **# Key Implications:**
    *   *How does the state of historical knowledge shape characters' understanding of their world and motivations?*
    *   *What narrative opportunities arise from lost history, unreliable records, or historical conspiracies?*
    *   *How does this contribute to the world's themes (memory, truth, control)?*

---

## V. Material Traces of the Past: Ruins, Artifacts, Environments

*Purpose: Authenticate the existence and basic nature of physical remnants that bear witness to the world's history.*

*   **Authenticated Feature:** `[e.g., Pre-Shattering Ruins:* Deep Undercity sectors *contain* structures built with unknown alloys and impossible geometry, often housing dormant or malfunctioning Artificer technology. Access *is extremely hazardous* due to decay and temporal instability.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Location Profile - Undercity, Lore Entries*
*   **Authenticated Feature:** `[e.g., Battle Scarring:* Certain districts *bear permanent visual scars* from past Guild skirmishes – blast marks on buildings, unrepaired structural damage, memorial plaques.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Location Descriptions, Recent History Doc*
*   **Authenticated Feature:** `[e.g., Salvaged Artifacts:* Objects clearly predating current Guild technology (often non-functional or poorly understood) *circulate* occasionally in the Brass Market or are hoarded by Guilds/collectors. Their authenticity *is often debated*.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Economic Conditions Doc, Object Lore*
*   **Authenticated Feature:** `[e.g., Environmental Traces:* Layers of Chrono-Dust sediment *form* a visible stratigraphy in undisturbed Undercity sections, potentially datable; specific types of temporal flora/fauna *only exist* near sites of major past temporal events.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Environmental Doc, Biology Doc*

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *What tangible evidence of the past exists in the present environment?*
    *   *How are these remnants perceived or interacted with by current inhabitants?*
    *   *Do these physical traces confirm or contradict official histories?*
    *   *What sensory details define these historical remnants (e.g., the smell of ancient dust, the feel of worn inscriptions)?*
*   **# Key Implications:**
    *   *How can environmental storytelling convey history non-verbally?*
    *   *What adventures or mysteries can be based around exploring ruins or finding artifacts?*

## VI. Methodological Notes for the Creator (Historical Focus)

*   **Authenticate Deliberately:** Choose which past events are crucial and define their core facts clearly. Decide what remains ambiguous or unknown.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Ensure your authenticated history aligns logically with the world's present state and its governing rules (modalities). Track dates and causal chains.
*   **Vary Authentication Methods:** Use a mix of direct narration, in-world documents, character testimony, and environmental clues to reveal history dynamically.
*   **Consider Bias:** Think about *who* is telling the history within your world and *why*. Use potential bias and unreliability as narrative tools.
*   **Show, Don't Just Recount (in Narrative):** While this document records authenticated facts, your stories should ideally reveal history through action, discovery, dialogue, and experience, not just info-dumps. Use this codex as your factual basis for that showing.
*   **History as Potential:** View the authenticated past as a deep wellspring of future story ideas, character motivations, and thematic exploration.
