Okay, Artist of Worlds, let's convert the Markdown protocol based on **"VII. Implications for Critical Judgment"** into YAML format and significantly expand it with **extreme detail**. This version aims to provide a highly rigorous framework for critically evaluating a fictional world (either your own in self-critique or someone else's) based on the structural and semantic principles derived from Doležel's *Heterocosmica*. It pushes beyond surface judgments to demand deep analysis of internal logic, systemic integration, purposeful originality, and structural thematic resonance.

# Story World Codex: Critical Evaluation Protocol
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Implications for Critical Judgment)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Evaluator: [Your Name / Critic Name]
# World Under Review: [Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides a framework for the **rigorous critical evaluation** of the [World Name] heterocosm, 
    grounded in the principles derived from Doležel's semantic theory of fiction. It moves beyond purely 
    mimetic, thematic, authorial, affective, or novelty-focused criteria to assess the world based on its 
    **internal coherence, systemic richness and integration, purposeful originality (systemic focus), 
    and structural thematic resonance**.
  focus: |
    To conduct a deep, evidence-based analysis of the world's **authenticated architecture** as presented 
    in its primary narrative texts and supporting canonical materials (e.g., World Bible/Codex, if available). 
    The goal is to evaluate the *craft* of world construction and its effectiveness *on its own terms*.

# --- I. Evaluation of Internal Coherence & Logical Integrity (The Foundational Check) ---
internal_coherence_evaluation:
  purpose: "Assess the world's adherence to its *own* authenticated rules and facts, treating consistency as a primary measure of structural soundness and prerequisite for believability."
  
  criteria:
    - criterion: "Modal Consistency (Alethic, Deontic, Axiological, Epistemic)"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Are the fundamental governing laws (physics, magic, tech limits; ethics, laws; values; knowledge rules) clearly discernible (explicitly/implicitly authenticated)?"
        - "Are these modalities applied *universally and consistently* across all relevant entities and situations within the narrative?"
        - "Are apparent violations of core modalities convincingly justified *within the world's logic* (e.g., rare exception with authenticated cause, unreliable narrator, deliberate paradox as world feature) or do they feel like arbitrary authorial fiat/plot convenience?"
        - "Do the different modalities interact logically (e.g., deontic rules reflect axiological values; epistemic limits affect ability to adhere to deontic codes)?"
      evidence_required: "[Cite specific examples of rule application, potential violations, justifications, and inter-modal interactions from text/Codex.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Rate: Rigorously Consistent / Generally Consistent with Minor Lapses / Moderately Inconsistent / Fundamentally Incoherent]"
      detailed_critique: "[Provide specific analysis of strengths/weaknesses in modal consistency, citing evidence.]"

    - criterion: "Diachronic Consistency (Temporal Coherence)"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Do authenticated facts (historical events, entity properties established early) remain stable throughout the narrative timeline unless change is explicitly authenticated and causally justified *within world rules*?"
        - "Is character development (change in properties) portrayed as a plausible evolution given past authenticated states and intervening events?"
        - "Does the world's progression through time feel logical based on its established history and dynamics? Are 'retcons' handled transparently and minimally, or do they create jarring discontinuities?"
      evidence_required: "[Track key facts/properties across narrative timeline; analyze character arcs for consistency; identify potential retcons or unexplained changes.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Rate: Highly Continuous / Generally Continuous / Noticeable Lapses / Chronologically Chaotic]"
      detailed_critique: "[Analyze specific examples of continuity success or failure, impact on world stability.]"

    - criterion: "Synchronic Consistency (Simultaneous Compatibility)"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Are elements authenticated as co-existing at the same narrative moment logically compatible according to world rules (e.g., entity properties vs. environmental state vs. active laws)?"
        - "Do different sub-systems (magic, tech, politics, ecology) interact plausibly without violating each other's established principles?"
        - "Does the 'snapshot' of the world at key moments present a coherent, functioning system?"
      evidence_required: "[Analyze complex scenes involving multiple interacting elements; cross-reference different Codex sections (Entities, States, Rules) for compatibility.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Rate: Highly Integrated / Generally Compatible / Some Frictions / Systemically Contradictory]"
      detailed_critique: "[Identify points of successful integration or logical friction between co-existing elements.]"

  overall_coherence_judgment:
    summary: "[Synthesize findings: Is the world fundamentally built on a sound internal logic, even if complex or fantastical?]"
    implications: "[How does the level of coherence impact potential audience trust, immersion, and the perceived 'reality' of the heterocosm?]"

# --- II. Evaluation of Systemic Richness & Functional Integration ---
systemic_richness_evaluation:
  purpose: "Assess the complexity, depth, and functional integration of the world's components, valuing meaningful interconnection over mere detail accumulation."

  criteria:
    - criterion: "Density and Meaningfulness of Interconnections"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Are the key systems (History, Politics, Economy, Tech/Magic, Environment, Society, etc.) demonstrably and non-trivially interconnected?"
        - "Do actions or changes in one system plausibly ripple through and affect other systems? Are these consequences explored?"
        - "Does the world feel like an integrated ecosystem or a collection of loosely related domains?"
      evidence_required: "[Map key causal links and feedback loops between different world systems documented in Codex/narrative.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Rate: Deeply Interconnected Ecosystem / Moderately Interconnected / Somewhat Siloed Systems / Poorly Integrated Elements]"
      detailed_critique: "[Analyze the strength, plausibility, and narrative significance of key systemic links.]"

    - criterion: "Functional Integration of Unique Elements"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Do the world's most defining or unique elements (e.g., specific magic system, core technology, central political conflict, unique species) actively *function* within the narrative and world system? Do they shape plot, constrain characters, generate themes, influence other systems?"
        - "Or do some unique elements feel like 'wallpaper' – aesthetically present but functionally inert or underdeveloped?"
        - "If a key unique element were removed, how much of the world's fundamental structure and narrative potential would collapse?"
      evidence_required: "[Trace the specific narrative and systemic impacts of 3-5 core unique world elements.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Rate: Elements Highly Functional & Integrated / Mostly Functional / Some Decorative / Significant 'Wallpaper']"
      detailed_critique: "[Assess the functional necessity vs. aesthetic presence of key world-defining features.]"

    - criterion: "Presence of Emergent Complexity"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Does the interaction of relatively simple authenticated rules and entities lead to complex, believable, and perhaps unforeseen systemic behaviors (e.g., intricate social dynamics, black markets, ecological shifts, political maneuvering)?"
        - "Does the world feel 'alive' with emergent possibilities arising from its core structure, or does everything feel directly and simply dictated?"
      evidence_required: "[Identify examples where complex outcomes arise from the interplay of established rules/entities, not just explicit authorial statement.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Rate: Rich Emergence / Moderate Emergence / Limited Emergence / Overly Determined System]"
      detailed_critique: "[Analyze the world's capacity for generating complexity from its foundational rules.]"

  overall_richness_judgment:
    summary: "[Synthesize findings: Does the world exhibit satisfying depth and complexity arising from well-integrated systems?]"
    implications: "[How does systemic richness contribute to the world's immersive quality, replay/re-read value, and potential for diverse storytelling?]"

# --- III. Evaluation of Originality (Systemic & Synthesis Focus) ---
originality_evaluation:
  purpose: "Assess originality based not just on novel concepts, but on the unique synthesis, modification, and coherent integration of elements within the world's specific architecture."

  criteria:
    - criterion: "Originality of Systemic Synthesis"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Even if using familiar elements/tropes, is the *specific combination* and *interaction* of these elements within this world's unique authenticated ruleset genuinely novel?"
        - "Does the overall *architecture* – the way history, modalities, entities, and states are integrated – create a system that functions or feels distinct from its predecessors or genre conventions?"
        - "Does the world achieve a unique 'flavor' or identity through this synthesis?"
      evidence_required: "[Compare world structure to common genre patterns; identify unique points of intersection between different systems/tropes.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Rate: Highly Original Synthesis / Creative Recombination / Competent Genre Execution / Feels Generic/Derivative]"
      detailed_critique: "[Pinpoint where the combination of elements generates true systemic originality.]"

    - criterion: "Creative Modification of Familiar Tropes"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Where familiar tropes (character archetypes, plot structures, setting elements) are used, are they merely replicated, or are they significantly **modified, recontextualized, or subverted** by Aethelgard's specific authenticated properties, modalities, or history?"
        - "Do these modifications feel purposeful and integrated, adding new layers or challenging expectations, or do they feel superficial?"
      evidence_required: "[Analyze specific tropes (from Trope Protocol); detail how their function/properties differ here compared to standard usage, linking to authenticated world rules.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Rate: Tropes Significantly Transformed / Tropes Creatively Adapted / Tropes Used Conventionally / Tropes Feel Unintegrated]"
      detailed_critique: "[Assess the degree and effectiveness of trope modification/recontextualization within the heterocosm.]"

    - criterion: "Valuation of Coherence as Achievement"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Does the world demonstrate a high degree of internal coherence across its complex systems (as assessed in Section I)? Is this structural integrity itself recognizable as a significant creative accomplishment, regardless of component novelty?"
      evidence_required: "[Reference findings from Section I on Coherence.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Acknowledge/Rate the creative value derived from achieved structural integrity.]"
      detailed_critique: "[Discuss how the world's coherence contributes to its overall artistic success.]"

  overall_originality_judgment:
    summary: "[Synthesize findings: Does the world achieve originality primarily through novel premises, masterful synthesis/modification of familiar elements, its sheer structural coherence, or a combination?]"
    implications: "[How does the specific *type* of originality contribute to the work's overall impact and potential longevity?]"

# --- IV. Evaluation of Thematic Resonance via Structure ---
thematic_resonance_evaluation:
  purpose: "Assess how effectively the world's fundamental architecture (modalities, history, systems) inherently embodies and explores the core themes, valuing structural resonance."

  criteria:
    - criterion: "Structural Embodiment of Core Themes"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Can core themes be directly traced to specific authenticated world structures (e.g., Memory/Identity theme linked to Memory Keeper function & Temporal Sickness rules; Order/Chaos theme linked to Guild structure vs. Aberrations/Undercity)?"
        - "Are the world's governing modalities (alethic, deontic, axiological, epistemic) purposefully designed to generate thematic questions or commentary?"
        - "Does the authenticated history provide a resonant backdrop or causal foundation for the exploration of themes?"
      evidence_required: "[Map core themes to specific authenticated world structures listed in Codex/Protocols.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Rate: Themes Deeply Embedded in Structure / Moderately Embedded / Superficially Linked / Structure Seems Thematically Arbitrary]"
      detailed_critique: "[Analyze the strength and specificity of the link between structure and theme.]"

    - criterion: "Thematic Resonance Through Systemic Interplay"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Do the *interactions* between different authenticated world systems (e.g., technology vs. society, history vs. environment) naturally generate or complicate thematic meaning?"
        - "Does the world system as a whole seem to function as a metaphor or argument related to the core themes?"
        - "Are thematic tensions reflected in the inherent conflicts *between* different structural components (e.g., clash between deontic laws and axiological values)?"
      evidence_required: "[Analyze examples of systemic interaction (from Interplay Protocol) for their thematic implications.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Rate: Strong Emergent Thematic Resonance / Moderate / Limited / Little Thematic Resonance from Interplay]"
      detailed_critique: "[Discuss how the interplay of systems contributes to (or fails to contribute to) thematic depth.]"

    - criterion: "Subtlety and Implicit Meaning (vs. Explicitness)"
      assessment_questions:
        - "Does the world structure allow themes to emerge organically for the audience to interpret, or does it rely heavily on explicit narratorial/character statements about meaning?"
        - "Is there a satisfying balance between showing themes through world function and telling themes through exposition?"
      evidence_required: "[Compare structural thematic elements with explicit thematic statements in the narrative.]"
      evaluation_scale: "[Rate: Primarily Implicit/Structural / Good Balance / Relies Heavily on Explicit Statement]"
      detailed_critique: "[Assess the effectiveness and sophistication of how themes are conveyed structurally vs. explicitly.]"

  overall_thematic_judgment:
    summary: "[Synthesize findings: How effectively and deeply does the world's architecture itself serve as a vehicle for thematic exploration?]"
    implications: "[How does the structural embedding of themes contribute to the work's potential intellectual and emotional impact?]"

# --- V. Final Critical Synthesis ---
final_critical_synthesis:
  purpose: "Provide a holistic evaluation based on the preceding analyses, summarizing the world's architectural strengths and weaknesses according to Doležel-inspired criteria."
  
  overall_strengths: "[Summarize key areas where the world excels in coherence, richness, systemic originality, and structural thematic resonance. Cite specific examples/analyses from above.]"
  overall_weaknesses: "[Summarize key areas where internal consistency falters, integration is weak, originality is lacking (at systemic level), or structure fails to support themes effectively. Cite specific examples/analyses.]"
  dominant_impression: "[What is the lasting critical impression of this heterocosm's architecture? Is it a masterfully crafted system, a flawed but ambitious structure, a collection of brilliant but disconnected ideas, etc.?]"
  recommendations_for_creator_or_further_study: "[Suggest areas for potential refinement if critiquing own work. Suggest avenues for further scholarly analysis if critiquing published work.]"
