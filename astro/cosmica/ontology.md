Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template designed as an **Entity Ontological Framework & Definition Guide**. This protocol draws directly from the principles discussed in **"V. The Ontology of Fictional Existence: Persons, Things, and Settings"** from Doležel's *Heterocosmica*.

Its purpose is to guide you in consistently applying Doležel's **text-centric, property-bundle ontology** during the design and documentation of *all* entities (characters, objects, locations, etc.) within your story world. It serves as a constant reminder of the unique nature of fictional being and helps ensure your creative choices align with this foundational principle.

# Story World Codex: Entity Ontology & Definition Guide
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.V (Ontology of Fictional Existence)

**World:** [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]
**Codex Version:** [e.g., 1.0 - Ontological Guide]
**Date Established:** [Current Date]
**Lead Architect(s):** [Your Name / Studio Name]

## Introduction: Defining Being within [World Name]

*This document establishes the **fundamental ontological principles** governing all entities (persons, objects, places, creatures, etc.) within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm, based on Doležel's semantic framework. It affirms that all entities exist **solely as textual constructs**, constituted entirely by their **authenticated bundles of properties and relations**.*

*Use this guide during entity creation and refinement to ensure a consistent understanding and application of this text-centric ontology. This involves consciously defining entities through their validated attributes and respecting the boundary between the authenticated heterocosm and external realities or assumptions.*

---

## I. Core Ontological Principle: Textual Constitution is Reality

*Purpose: To affirm the absolute foundation of existence within this heterocosm.*

*   **[X] Guiding Principle:** Entities in [World Name] **ARE** their authenticated property bundles. They possess **NO** independent substance, hidden essence, real-world psychological depth, or physical reality beyond what is explicitly or strongly implicitly **authenticated** within the canonical texts and Master Codex.
*   **Design Implication:** Focus creative effort on defining the **specific properties and relations** that constitute the entity. Avoid relying on vague notions or assuming unstated attributes based on real-world analogies.
*   **Analysis Implication:** When evaluating an entity, focus *only* on its authenticated textual definition.

*   **# Self-Check:** *Am I describing what this entity *is* based on its authenticated traits, or am I describing what it *reminds me of* in the real world? Stick to the former.*

---

## II. Applying the Ontology to **Fictional Persons** (Characters, Sentient Beings)

*Purpose: To ensure consistent application of the ontology to characters, avoiding naive psychologism.*

*   **[ ] Constitution Check:** Is the character defined by a documented bundle of **authenticated** Physical, Functional, Psychological, Social, Modal, Axiological, and Historical properties? (Reference Entity Constitution Protocols).
*   **[ ] Psychological Boundaries:** Are authenticated psychological properties (traits, beliefs, emotions, motivations) treated as **constitutive** of the character's inner life *within the text*, rather than symptoms of an assumed deeper, independent psyche?
    *   *Guideline:* Avoid applying external psychological theories (Freudian, Jungian, etc.) directly *to the character* as if they were a real patient. These theories might *inform* the *creator's design* of the property bundle, but the bundle itself *is* the character's authenticated psychology.
*   **[ ] Undersaturation Acknowledged:** Is it accepted that the character is **necessarily incomplete**? Are questions about unauthenticated aspects of their life, thoughts, or body treated as fundamentally unanswerable *about the canonical entity*?
*   **[ ] Agency as Authenticated Function:** Is the character's agency (ability to choose/act) understood as arising from their **authenticated functional and psychological properties** operating within the **world's modal constraints**, rather than assumed real-world free will?

*   **# Self-Check:** *When describing a character's motivation, can I point to specific authenticated properties (desires, beliefs, traits, past experiences) that logically lead to it within the world's rules? Or am I assuming a hidden, real-world-like motivation?*

---

## III. Applying the Ontology to **Fictional Objects** (Things, Artifacts, Tech)

*Purpose: To ensure consistent application of the ontology to inanimate objects, focusing on their authenticated properties and functions.*

*   **[ ] Constitution Check:** Is the object defined by a documented bundle of **authenticated** Physical (material, appearance, sensory signature), Functional (capabilities, limitations, operational rules, costs), Modal (if applicable, e.g., indestructible), Axiological (world-internal value/reputation), and Historical (origin, provenance) properties?
*   **[ ] Emphasis on Function/Physics:** Does the definition prioritize the object's **authenticated function and interaction with world physics/magic rules** over assuming real-world material properties? (e.g., A "steel sword" might have unique authenticated properties like 'cannot rust' or 'cuts ghosts' that override AW assumptions about steel).
*   **[ ] Undersaturation Acknowledged:** Is it accepted that the object lacks infinite physical detail (atomic structure, exact weight unless specified) and possesses only its authenticated functions and history?
*   **[ ] Avoiding Anthropomorphism (Unless Authenticated):** Unless sentience is an *explicitly authenticated property* (e.g., a sentient artifact), is the object treated as non-conscious, its "actions" described purely in terms of its authenticated functions and interactions with external forces?

*   **# Self-Check:** *When describing how a device works, am I relying on its *authenticated* functional properties and limitations within Aethelgard's rules, or assuming it works like a similar real-world object?*

---

## IV. Applying the Ontology to **Fictional Places** (Settings, Locations, Environments)

*Purpose: To ensure consistent application of the ontology to settings, treating them as constituted environments, not just backdrops.*

*   **[ ] Constitution Check:** Is the place defined by a documented bundle of **authenticated** Physical (geography, architecture, climate, sensory atmosphere), Functional (enables/constrains movement, provides resources, source of hazards), Social/Political (jurisdiction, cultural significance, population type), Modal (if applicable, e.g., 'hallowed ground', 'zone of altered physics'), Axiological (reputation, perceived beauty/danger), and Historical (site of past events, age) properties?
*   **[ ] Environment as System:** Is the place treated as an **integrated system** whose authenticated properties actively influence the entities and events within it, rather than just a passive stage?
*   **[ ] Undersaturation Acknowledged:** Is it accepted that the described place lacks infinite detail (every building, every inhabitant, full geological history) beyond what is authenticated as relevant? Are maps understood as representations of *authenticated spatial relations and key features*, not exhaustive replicas?
*   **[ ] Avoiding Simple AW Analogy:** While potentially modeled on real places, is the fictional place treated as an **autonomous heterocosmic entity** defined by its *own* authenticated history, atmosphere, and functional properties (which may differ significantly from its AW inspiration)?

*   **# Self-Check:** *When describing a scene's location, am I focusing on authenticating the *specific properties* of that place that are *functionally relevant* to the characters and events, rather than just providing generic description? How do its authenticated properties *constrain or enable* the action?*

---

## V. Maintaining Ontological Boundaries

*Purpose: To consistently uphold the distinction between the textually constituted heterocosm and external realities.*

*   **[ ] Internal Focus:** Does the primary creative and analytical focus remain on the **internal structure, logic, and authenticated properties** of the [World Name] heterocosm?
*   **[ ] Controlled AW Reference:** Is reference to the Actual World used primarily for **contrast**, for establishing **minimal departure** defaults where necessary, or as **inspiration**, rather than as the *measure* or *source of truth* for fictional elements?
*   **[ ] Clear Creator/Reader Separation:** Is the ontological separation between the **external creator/reader** and the **internal heterocosm** maintained (unless deliberate, authenticated metafiction is employed)?
*   **[ ] Adaptation as New Entity:** Are adaptations into different media understood as creating **new, related heterocosms** with potentially different authenticated property bundles, requiring their own consistent definition?

*   **# Self-Check:** *Am I ensuring that the rules, history, and entity capabilities within Aethelgard are validated by *internal* authentication within the Codex/narratives, not just by assumption or external knowledge?*

## Conclusion: Commitment to Textual Reality

*By adhering to this protocol, we commit to building and understanding the entities of [Your Story World Name] through the lens of **textual constitution**. We embrace the **bundle ontology**, recognizing that the essence of fictional being lies in the **rich, diverse, and coherently integrated network of properties and relations authenticated by the authoritative narrative discourse**.*

*This approach allows us to create complex and compelling entities while maintaining **theoretical rigor and internal consistency**. It respects the unique nature of fictional existence – autonomous, textually dependent, and necessarily undersaturated – providing a solid foundation for narrative development and critical analysis within the specific reality of the [World Name] heterocosm.*

**How This Markdown Document Guides Ontological Design:**

1.  **Explicit Ontology Statement:** It begins by requiring affirmation of the core Doležel-inspired ontology (textual constitution, bundle theory) as the guiding principle for the *entire world*.
2.  **Categorical Application:** It systematically applies this ontology to the major entity types (Persons, Objects, Places), highlighting the specific considerations and potential pitfalls for each.
3.  **Focus on Authentication:** Continually emphasizes that properties *must be authenticated* textually to be considered part of the entity's reality.
4.  **Addresses Undersaturation Directly:** Integrates the concept of necessary incompleteness into the definition process for each entity type.
5.  **Warns Against Fallacies:** Explicitly cautions against naive realism (treating fictional entities like real ones) and psychological projection (assuming hidden depths beyond the text).
6.  **Maintains Boundaries:** Includes checks for maintaining the ontological boundary between the heterocosm and the Actual World (including creator/reader).
7.  **Self-Correction Prompts:** Embeds questions designed to make the creator critically reflect on whether their design choices align with the established ontological framework.

This protocol serves as a constant guide and reminder during the creative process, helping ensure that all entities within your story world are conceived and documented in a way that is consistent with the rigorous, text-centric understanding of fictional being derived from Doležel's work.
