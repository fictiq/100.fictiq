# Story World Codex: Fictional Object Constitution Protocol
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Object Ontology)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly granular framework** for the meticulous definition 
    of **inanimate Fictional Objects** (artifacts, technologies, tools, key props, symbolic items, etc.) 
    within the Aethelgard heterocosm. Applying Doležel's ontology, it treats objects as **bundles 
    of authenticated properties**, with a critical focus on their **functional parameters (capabilities, 
    limitations, costs, operational logic) and physical constitution**, grounded in textual evidence.
  scope: |
    Mandatory template for defining all significant canonical objects. Ensures objects are not mere props 
    but **functionally integrated, sensorially vivid, historically contextualized, and thematically 
    resonant components** of the world system, possessing a clear, textually defined reality.
  ontological_premise: |
    An object within Aethelgard **IS** its authenticated property bundle. It possesses **NO** independent 
    substance, hidden functions, or real-world material equivalencies beyond what is explicitly or 
    implicitly validated by the authoritative narrative discourse (Codex & primary texts). Its potential 
    and limitations are strictly defined by this semantic constitution. Psychological properties are 
    absent unless sentience is explicitly authenticated (making it verge on Creature/Person).

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Fictional Objects:

Ontology First: Starts with a strict affirmation of the text-centric, property-bundle ontology specifically for objects, rejecting hidden substance or simple AW analogies.

Hyper-Granular Physicality: Breaks down physical properties into extremely detailed subcategories, demanding consideration of morphology, internal structure (if known), material properties, complex surface details, light interaction specifics, state of decay and repair, multi-sensory signatures (sound, smell, taste if relevant), and characteristic presence.

Deep Functional Analysis: Requires defining primary and secondary functions, operational requirements, specific capabilities and scope/intensity, explicit costs/resource consumption, precise limitations/inabilities, and authenticated vulnerabilities/failure modes. Demands thinking like an engineer or logician about how the object works within world rules.

Systemic Relational Mapping: Focuses on the object's place in the network – ownership, legal status, factional control/association, and how it relates to key entities as a driver of action.

Detailed Historical Provenance: Requires tracing origin, manufacture, past ownership, and links to specific historical events beyond simple backstory.

Rigorous Modal/Axiological Status: Demands clear authentication for any unique modal properties (exceptions to world laws) or inherent value status, linking them to narrative function. Distinguishes inherent value from perceived reputation.

Exhaustive Undersaturation Notes: Requires explicitly identifying undefined aspects for each major category, forcing conscious management of incompleteness specific to the object.

Intensive Prompts: Includes highly specific prompts designed to push thinking about sensory details, functional edge cases, systemic impact, consistency checks, and narrative purpose related to the object's properties.

Rich Synthesis: The summary demands articulating the object's core essence, narrative role, systemic impact, and the function of its mysteries based on the entire detailed property bundle.

This extremely detailed YAML template guides the creator to define fictional objects in Aethelgard with profound depth and rigor, ensuring they are not just passive props but fully constituted, functionally coherent, and narratively significant components of the heterocosmic architecture.
