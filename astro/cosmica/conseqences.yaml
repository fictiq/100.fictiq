# Story World Codex: Entity Ontology & Constitution Checklist
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Ontological Consequences)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly detailed framework** for establishing and maintaining 
    the **fundamental ontology** governing all entities within the Aethelgard heterocosm. It rigorously 
    applies the **ontological consequences** derived from Doležel's semantic theory, particularly the 
    principle that fictional entities **ARE** nothing more or less than **complex bundles of textually 
    authenticated properties and relations**. 
  scope: |
    Mandatory foundational document guiding all entity creation, description, and analysis. Ensures 
    a consistent understanding of *what it means to be* within Aethelgard, preventing metaphysical 
    drift, naive realism, or psychological projection, and grounding all world elements firmly 
    within their textually constituted reality.
  ontological_premise: |
    The Aethelgard heterocosm operates under a strict **semantic ontology**. Entities possess no 
    independent substance, hidden essence, or extra-textual reality. Their entire being, identity, 
    potential, and limitations are **exhaustively defined** by the sum total of properties and 
    relations **authenticated** for them by the authoritative narrative discourse, as codified in 
    the Master Codex.

# --- I. Core Ontological Commitment: Affirmation of Textual Constitution ---
core_ontological_commitment:
  purpose: "To formally ratify the absolute primacy of textual authentication as the sole source of being within Aethelgard."
  
  principles:
    - principle_id: "ONTO_COMMIT_01"
      name: "Textual Genesis & Sustenance"
      declaration: |
        **Affirmed:** The existence of any entity within the Aethelgard canon commences *only* upon its 
        introduction via authenticated predication within a canonical source and persists *only* as 
        long as it remains part of the actively maintained, authenticated textual corpus (Codex & narratives). 
        Entities possess no pre-existence or post-textual persistence.
      implication: "Analysis must always trace back to specific textual moments of authentication."

    - principle_id: "ONTO_COMMIT_02"
      name: "Bundle Ontology Supremacy"
      declaration: |
        **Affirmed:** Each authenticated entity **IS IDENTICAL TO** the unique, structured bundle of all its 
        authenticated properties (physical, functional, psychological, social, modal, axiological, historical) 
        and relations. There is **no distinction** between the entity and the sum of its validated textual definition.
      implication: "Rejects substance metaphysics entirely for fictional entities; essence IS the authenticated bundle."

    - principle_id: "ONTO_COMMIT_03"
      name: "Semantic Nature of Being"
      declaration: |
        **Affirmed:** The 'substance' constituting Aethelgard entities is **semantic information**. Properties 
        and relations are units of meaning assigned through language. The heterocosm is fundamentally an 
        **architecture of meaning**, not a simulation of physical reality (though it simulates physical properties semantically).
      implication: "Analysis focuses on meaning structures, logical relations between predicates, and semantic coherence."

  self_reflection_prompt: |
    When conceptualizing a new entity, is my primary focus on defining its **authenticated properties and relations** 
    through precise language, rather than assuming an underlying 'character' that I am merely describing?

# --- II. Rigorous Management of Undersaturation (Necessary Incompleteness) ---
undersaturation_management:
  purpose: "To operationalize the understanding of undersaturation as a fundamental ontological consequence of textual finitude, requiring strategic management."

  defining_principle:
    name: "Undersaturation as Ontological Law"
    statement: |
      **Affirmed:** Due to the **finite nature of textual authentication**, all Aethelgard entities ARE 
      **necessarily and fundamentally undersaturated** (incomplete) compared to the infinite property density 
      of Actual World entities. This is not a flaw but an inherent characteristic of their constituted being.
    implication: "Infinite detail is impossible and undesirable; focus must be on strategic definition."

  distinguishing_gaps:
    ontological_gaps_undersaturation:
      definition: "Properties or details **genuinely non-existent** for the entity within the heterocosm because they were never authenticated into its constitutive bundle."
      analytical_treatment: "Acknowledge as undefined. Questions regarding these properties are ill-formed relative to the entity's authenticated reality. Avoid speculative filling presented as canonical fact."
      examples: "[e.g., Kaelen's exact blood type; the precise number of rivets on the Grand Orrery; Ticker's 'childhood' experiences.]"
    epistemic_gaps:
      definition: "Properties or facts **authenticated as existing** within the heterocosm but **currently unknown** to specific characters or the audience due to authenticated information control, narrative pacing, or character limitations."
      analytical_treatment: "Analyze as part of the world's knowledge landscape (Epistemic Modality) and narrative structure (mystery, suspense). These gaps *can* be filled by further authenticated revelations."
      examples: "[e.g., The *content* of the sealed Artificer data Kaelen seeks; the *identity* of the Guild traitor; the *exact location* of the Moon Shard Heart.]"

  strategic_undersaturation_policy:
    guideline: "Areas of undersaturation should be largely **intentional design choices**, serving specific purposes:"
    purposes:
      - "Creating Core Mysteries (e.g., leaving Shattering cause undefined)."
      - "Maintaining Narrative Focus (e.g., not detailing irrelevant minor character backstories)."
      - "Allowing Reader Imagination/Co-Creation (within guided bounds)."
      - "Providing Flexibility for Future Development (leaving specific historical periods vague)."
      - "Enhancing Thematic Resonance (e.g., undefined past reinforcing memory themes)."
    codex_practice: "Codex entries should ideally note significant *intentional* undersaturation for key entities/concepts."

  undersaturation_check_prompt: |
    For a major entity, identify 3 properties it definitively *lacks* due to undersaturation. Now identify 
    1 property that is merely *epistemically hidden* but authenticated to exist. Does the narrative/Codex 
    clearly signal this difference?

# --- III. Specificity & Determinacy within Textual Limits ---
specificity_determinacy:
  purpose: "To leverage authentication for creating precise definitions where needed, while acknowledging the boundaries of this determinacy."

  principle_of_authenticated_precision:
    statement: |
      Where the authoritative text **authenticates a specific property or relation**, that attribute IS 
      **precisely and determinately true** for the entity within the heterocosm (subject only to potential 
      future *authenticated* change/retcon). Fictional entities possess a high degree of specificity *regarding 
      their defined attributes*.
    examples: "[e.g., If authenticated, Kaelen's prosthetic *is* Aethelian Brass #7; the Chrono-Viewer's range *is* 10m; the Paradox penalty *does* involve memory fragmentation.]"
    implication: "Provides stable, reliable data points for narrative logic and audience understanding."

  boundary_of_determinacy:
    statement: |
      This determinacy **extends ONLY to authenticated properties**. Aspects left undersaturated remain 
      genuinely indeterminate *within the heterocosm*. Precision applies only where language has performed 
      its constitutive work.
    example: "[e.g., We know Kaelen's role precisely, but his pre-amnesia motivations remain indeterminate until/unless authenticated.]"
    implication: "Analysis must respect this boundary, focusing precision on validated details."

  strategic_precision_levels:
    guideline: "Apply high levels of authenticated precision primarily to elements **crucial for plot mechanics, core characterization, thematic argument, or establishing key world rules**. Allow for greater undersaturation in peripheral details."
    example: "[e.g., Precise limits of magic system = High Precision needed. Exact clothing description of background character = Low Precision needed.]"

  prompts_precision:
    - "Identify 3 properties of a key entity that MUST be defined with absolute precision for the core narrative to function logically. Are they clearly authenticated?"
    - "Identify 3 properties where ambiguity or lack of precision actually *enhances* the narrative or theme. Is this undersaturation intentional?"

# --- IV. Affirmation of Autonomy & World-Dependence ---
autonomy_world_dependence:
  purpose: "To reinforce the entity's existence as solely within and dependent upon its specific heterocosm."

  ontological_separation_from_aw:
    affirmation: "All entities constituted herein are **ontologically distinct** from any real-world counterparts, inspirations, or analogues. Their properties and behaviors are governed *only* by Aethelgard's internal, authenticated modalities and history, not AW physics or sociology unless explicitly authenticated as such."
    methodological_directive: "Analysis and creative choices must avoid naive importation of AW assumptions or standards."

  heterocosmic_containment:
    affirmation: "Entities authenticated within the Aethelgard heterocosm **exist only within its semantic boundaries**. They cannot logically interact with or migrate to the AW or other distinct fictional heterocosms (e.g., Middle-earth) unless such interaction is a *specifically authenticated meta-fictional property* of Aethelgard itself."
    methodological_directive: "Treat each heterocosm as autonomous. Analyze adaptations (film, game) as creating *related but distinct* heterocosms requiring separate analysis of their specific authentications."

  contextual_meaning:
    affirmation: "The meaning, function, and significance of any entity's properties and relations are **dependent on their context within the specific semantic network and modal structure** of Aethelgard. The property 'is magical' has meaning only relative to Aethelgard's authenticated rules of magic."
    methodological_directive: "Interpret properties and actions always in relation to the specific world system they inhabit."

  prompts_autonomy:
    - "Identify a property of an Aethelgard entity that directly contradicts AW reality. How is its internal validity solely dependent on textual authentication?"
    - "Consider an entity adapting across media (e.g., Kaelen in TV vs. Kaelen in game). Where might their authenticated property bundles necessarily differ due to medium constraints, technically creating distinct (though related) entities?"

# --- V. Clarifying Fictional "Life" & "Consciousness" (Semantic Constitution) ---
fictional_life_consciousness:
  purpose: "To apply the textual ontology rigorously to complex concepts like life and consciousness, avoiding anthropomorphic projection."

  definition_of_life_fictional:
    principle: "An entity is considered 'alive' within Aethelgard **if and only if** the text authenticates for it the specific bundle of **functional and physical properties** associated with living beings *within this heterocosm's established biological/metaphysical rules* (e.g., metabolism (if defined), agency, responsiveness, reproduction (if defined), susceptibility to 'death' as defined by world rules)."
    implication: "'Life' is a predicated status based on authenticated functional criteria, not an appeal to AW biology unless relevant rules are authenticated."

  definition_of_consciousness_sentience_fictional:
    principle: |
      Fictional 'consciousness' or 'sentience' **IS** the **authenticated bundle of psychological properties** assigned by the text. This includes authenticated self-awareness predicates, complex thought processes, emotional states, subjective experiences (as narrated), and capacity for intentional action. It is a **textually constructed simulation of interiority**.
    rejection_of_hidden_qualia: "This framework makes **no claim** about whether fictional entities possess genuine phenomenal consciousness or subjective qualia analogous to humans. It analyzes only the **authenticated textual representation** of mental life."
    complexity_vs_reality: "Perceived depth arises from the **richness and coherence of the authenticated psychological bundle**, not from assuming an inaccessible 'real mind' behind the text."
    application_to_ai_automatons: |
      The potential sentience of entities like 'Ticker' is determined **solely** by the specific psychological and functional properties **authenticated** for them (e.g., exhibiting curiosity, processing paradoxes, expressing 'emotion-like' glitches). They *are* what the text defines them to be within the world, whether that aligns with AW definitions of AI or not.

  prompts_consciousness:
    - "For a sentient character, list the specific authenticated properties that *constitute* its consciousness within the narrative (e.g., internal monologue, stated beliefs, emotional reactions)."
    - "For an Automaton like Ticker, what specific authenticated *behaviors* or *internal processing descriptions* build the *case* for its potential emergent sentience *within the text*?"
    - "How does Aethelgard's definition of 'Temporal Sickness' (affecting memory/perception) challenge simplistic notions of stable consciousness even for humans?"

# --- VI. Managing the Boundary with the Actual World (Creator/Reader) ---
# Purpose: Maintain methodological clarity regarding the ontological separation between the heterocosm and its external creator/audience.
boundary_management_aw:

  creator_role_external: "The real-world creator(s) function as the **external originators** of the authenticating discourse but are **not inhabitants** of the heterocosm. Their personal intentions or biography are distinct from the **textual authorial function** operating within the narrative system."
  reader_role_external: "The real-world reader **actualizes** the heterocosm by processing the authenticated textual blueprint and constructing a **subjective mental model**, potentially enriched by personal inference and imagination, but remains **ontologically separate** from the world itself."
  metafiction_as_authenticated_exception: "Direct interaction or awareness between heterocosmic entities and the AW (creator/reader) is **impossible** unless **metafictional properties** allowing such boundary-crossing are **explicitly authenticated** as part of Aethelgard's fundamental rules (a specific modal choice)." # Assume standard non-metafictional stance unless otherwise stated.

  prompts_boundary:
    - "Identify an element potentially based on AW inspiration. How have its properties been *specifically authenticated* to integrate it fully into Aethelgard's unique logic?"
    - "Where might a reader be tempted to fill an undersaturated gap with AW assumptions that *contradict* Aethelgard's established rules? How does the text guide against this?"

# --- VII. Final Ontological Affirmation ---
final_ontological_affirmation:
  purpose: "A concluding statement summarizing the definitive nature of fictional being within the Aethelgard heterocosm based on Doležel's principles."
  
  summary_of_fictional_being: |
    The entities populating Aethelgard – whether persons grappling with fractured memories, intricate automatons 
    exhibiting strange glitches, impossible creatures born of temporal chaos, enduring objects bearing historical 
    scars, or locations steeped in atmospheric decay – possess a unique mode of being. They are:
    - **Textually Forged:** Their existence and essence spring solely from authenticated language.
    - **Semantically Composed:** They ARE bundles of validated meanings (properties & relations).
    - **Autonomously Governed:** They operate under Aethelgard's unique, internal modalities.
    - **Contextually Defined:** Their significance arises from their position within the world's network.
    - **Necessarily Incomplete:** Their definition is bounded by the limits of textual authentication.
    - **Precisely Determined (Where Defined):** They possess clarity regarding their authenticated attributes.
    - **Coherence-Reliant:** Their believability hinges on the logical consistency of their constitution.
  
  concluding_statement: |
    Understanding these ontological consequences is paramount for both creation and analysis. It allows creators 
    to wield the power of linguistic assertion with purpose and responsibility, building complex yet coherent 
    realities. It equips analysts to dissect these realities rigorously, respecting their unique nature as 
    **semantic architectures** rather than flawed mirrors of our own world. The nature of fictional being 
    in Aethelgard is affirmed as purely and profoundly **textual**.

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Ontological Consequences:

Formal Declarations: Uses articles, sections, and explicit "Affirmed" or "Principle" statements to give the ontological points the weight of constitutional declarations for the world.

Exhaustive Reiteration: Repeatedly reinforces the core tenets (textual constitution, bundle ontology, undersaturation) throughout different sections to ensure absolute clarity.

Granular Distinction (Ontological vs. Epistemic): Section II provides detailed definitions and examples to rigorously separate undefined properties (ontology) from unknown properties (epistemology).

Precise Definition of Terms: Clearly defines "Specificity," "Determinacy," "Autonomy," "World-Dependence" within the context of Doležel's framework.

Deep Dive into Consciousness/Life: Section V tackles these complex concepts head-on, providing a strict semantic/functional definition based on authenticated properties, explicitly rejecting naive anthropomorphism or assumptions of hidden qualia.

Explicit Boundary Management: Section VI formally addresses the relationship with the AW creator/reader, explicitly stating the default separation and conditions for metafiction.

Rigorous Prompts: Includes highly specific prompts demanding critical reflection on the application of these ontological principles in design and analysis (e.g., "How does the authenticated bundle differ from reader assumptions?" "Is the level of determinacy appropriate?").

Final Synthesis as Doctrine: The conclusion summarizes the nature of fictional being as a set of core doctrines derived from the theory, solidifying the world's philosophical foundation.

This extremely detailed YAML provides a rigorous framework for ensuring that the very concept of "being" within Aethelgard is consistently understood and applied according to the specific, text-centric ontology derived from Doležel's Heterocosmica, guiding both creation and analysis with profound theoretical clarity.
