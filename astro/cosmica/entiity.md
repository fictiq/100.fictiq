# Story World Codex: Entity Constitution Protocol (Property Bundle Method)
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II

**World:** [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]

## Introduction: Building Entities from Authenticated Attributes

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of entities within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm using Doležel's principle that fictional entities **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (i.e., this Codex and core narrative texts).*

*Instead of relying on vague descriptions or assuming hidden depths, this method involves **explicitly listing the key authenticated properties** across diverse categories that collectively **define** the entity's nature, function, and reality within this world. Properties not listed are considered **undefined (undersaturated)** unless later authenticated.*

*Focus on **authentication**: Only list properties considered 'true' or factual *for this world* based on your creative decisions. Use comments `#` for notes, potential developments, or subjective perceptions attributed *to other characters* about this entity.*

## Entity Profile: [Entity Name/ID]

*(Copy and refine this template for each significant entity)*

**Entity ID:** `[Unique Identifier, e.g., CHAR_Kaelen_01]`
**Entity Name:** `[Common Name, e.g., Investigator Kaelen]`
**Entity Type:** `[Person | Object | Place | Creature | Organization | Concept | Other]`
**Authentication Status:** `[Authenticated & Canonical | Legendary (Existence Authenticated, Details Mythical) | Rumored (Existence Unconfirmed) | Conceptual (Abstract Entity)]`
**Primary Definition Source(s):** `[e.g., This Codex Entry, Core Narrative Outline Ch. 1-5, Character Bible v0.2]`

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(List the specific, validated properties constituting this entity. Be precise.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Tangible Manifestation):**
    *   `- Appearance_Form: [e.g., Humanoid, lean build, approx. 6'0"]`

    *   `- Belief_Worldview: [e.g., Believes the 'System' (Guilds/Council) is inherently corrupt]`
    *   `- Emotional_Disposition: [e.g., Generally melancholic, prone to moments of intense frustration]`
    *   `- Cognitive_Style: [e.g., Highly analytical, relies on logic over intuition (usually)]`

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Place in the System):**
    *   `- Role_Official: [e.g., Investigator, City Watch Precinct 4]`
    *   `- Faction_Allegiance: [e.g., Nominally City Watch, but operates semi-independently; Growing contacts with Undercity Network (Relation)]`
    *   `- Social_Status: [e.g., Low-ranking Guildless official; viewed with suspicion by some Guild members]`
    *   `- Species: [e.g., Human (Baseline)]`
    *   `- Key_Relation_Ally: [e.g., Reluctant working relationship with 'Rust' (Salvager)]`
    *   `- Key_Relation_Antagonist: [e.g., Obstructed by elements within Memory Keepers Guild]`
    *   `# - Undefined: Extended family, specific friends outside main cast`

**5. Modal Properties (Relationship to World Laws):**
    *   `- Property_Alethic: [e.g., Subject to standard Aethelgard human mortality/physics]`
    *   `- Property_Deontic: [e.g., Bound by City Watch regulations (though sometimes bends them)]`
    *   `- Property_Epistemic: [e.g., Possesses only standard human senses + authenticated temporal sensitivity; knowledge limited by amnesia and Guild secrecy]`
    *   `# - Note: Usually entities *follow* world modalities; explicitly list only if they have a *unique* modal status (e.g., 'Immune to Paradox Sickness').`

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value Status):**
    *   `- Reputation_Watch: [e.g., Considered 'persistent' and 'unpredictable' by superiors]`
    *   `- Reputation_Undercity: [e.g., Viewed as potentially useful but ultimately an 'outsider' / 'Surface scum']`
    *   `- Self_Value (Authenticated): [e.g., Values 'truth' highly, even if damaging; Devalues bureaucratic procedure]`
    *   `# - Undefined: Wider public perception (likely unknown/irrelevant)`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past):**
    *   `- Origin: [e.g., Authenticated as 'Appeared in city approx. 2 years ago with no memory'; records prior are missing/sealed]`
    *   `- Key_Past_Event_Link: [e.g., Possesses fragmented memories/sensory flashes potentially linked to Artificers or a specific hidden event (Core Mystery)]`
    *   `- Known_Former_Life (If Any): [e.g., Evidence suggests potential past affiliation with Chronometers Guild (based on tech familiarity), but unconfirmed/unauthenticated]`
    *   `# - Undefined: Almost all personal history pre-amnesia`

### Summary: Entity Essence Profile

*Purpose: Briefly synthesize the core identity emerging from the property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `[e.g., Kaelen is constituted as a skilled but deeply fractured Noir Investigator, defined by his lack of past and obsessive search for truth within a system built on secrets and unreliable time. His core tension arises from his analytical mind (property) grappling with memory loss (limitation) within a world where both history and perception are unstable (modalities/epistemic state).] `
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `[e.g., To drive mystery plots, explore themes of memory/identity, act as audience surrogate into the world's hidden workings.]`
*   **Key Internal Contradiction (if any):** `[e.g., Cynicism vs. Underlying drive for truth; reliance on logic vs. dealing with illogical temporal phenomena.]`

**How to Use This Protocol Effectively:**

1.  **Be Explicit & Authoritative:** When filling this out, you are *legislating* the entity's reality. Be clear and decisive about the properties you are authenticating *as true* for your world. Use definitive language.
2.  **Categorize Thoughtfully:** Placing properties into the correct categories helps ensure you are considering the entity's multifaceted nature (physical, functional, psychological, social, etc.).
3.  **Focus on *Authenticated* Properties:** Resist the urge to add details that "feel right" but haven't actually been established or validated within your narrative framework or core design documents. If it's speculation, use comments `#`.
4.  **Embrace Undersaturation:** Use the `# - Undefined:` comments or simply omit properties to consciously manage the entity's incompleteness. This leaves room for future reveals, reader imagination, and prevents unnecessary detail. Don't define what doesn't need defining *yet*.
5.  **Link Properties to World Rules:** Especially for Functional and Modal properties, ensure they align with the overarching Modalities established for your heterocosm.
6.  **Build Incrementally:** You don't need to define every property for every entity at once. Start with core entities and essential properties, then add more authenticated details as they become relevant during narrative development, always updating the Codex profile.
7.  **Use as Consistency Check:** Refer back to these profiles constantly during writing/design to ensure characters act according to their authenticated properties and limitations.
8.  **Synthesize the Essence:** The summary section forces you to articulate the core identity that *emerges* from the specific combination of properties you have authenticated, clarifying the entity's role and potential.

By meticulously building your entities as **bundles of diverse, authenticated properties**, you create characters, objects, and places that are not only imaginative but also possess clear definitions, functional potential, inherent limitations, and structural integrity within the specific reality of your heterocosm, fully realizing the ontological implications of Doležel's framework.
