Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template designed to help you define the **Foundational Modal Structures** of your story world, directly applying the principles from **"VI. The Analytical Engine: Modal Structure of Heterocosms"** based on Lubomír Doležel's *Heterocosmica*.

This protocol focuses on consciously **legislating and authenticating the fundamental "laws"** governing your world – its core rules of possibility, obligation, value, and knowledge. Defining these modalities clearly and consistently is crucial for establishing the world's internal logic, guiding narrative development, and ensuring overall coherence. This template serves as your world's "Constitutional Convention."

## Introduction: Legislating the Fundamental Laws of [World Name]

*This protocol guides the definition and authentication of the **core Governing Modalities** for the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Following Doležel, these structures are not external analytical tools but **intrinsic properties of the world system itself, constituted through authenticated predication**. They form the **fundamental 'operating system' or 'constitution'** defining what is possible, necessary, obligatory, permissible, valuable, and knowable within this specific reality.*

*Use this document to explicitly **legislate and authenticate** the key rules for each modality. Clarity, consistency, and consideration of their interplay are paramount for building a coherent, functional, and narratively potent heterocosm.*

## Article I: Alethic Modality (The Laws of Possibility & Necessity)

*Purpose: Define the absolute boundaries of what *can* and *cannot* physically, metaphysically, or technologically occur. Establish the fundamental operational reality.*

*   **Section 1.1: Baseline Physical Laws & Causality:**
    *   **Authenticated Principle:** `[Define the baseline reality. e.g., Standard AW-analogous physics apply EXCEPT where superseded by authenticated Chrono-Tech/Anomalies.]`
    *   **Authenticated Principle:** `[Define core causality. e.g., Linear causality dominant; Paradox is a real, dangerous consequence of attempting temporal alteration; Localized non-linear effects ARE possible near anomalies.]`
    *   *Implications Notes:* `[e.g., Grounds world, makes deviations significant, defines core danger.]`

*   **Section 1.2: Core Speculative Element Rules (e.g., Chrono-Tech, Magic, Unique Biology):**
    *   **(System ID: [e.g., Chrono-Tech])**
        *   `Authenticated Possibility 1:` `[e.g., Localized Temporal Observation ('Echo Viewing') IS possible.]`
        *   `Authenticated Limit/Cost 1a:` `[e.g., Requires Refined Chrono-Dust; Limited to ~24hr lookback; Accuracy degrades; Induces Temporal Sickness.]`
        *   `Authenticated Possibility 2:` `[e.g., Creation of small Temporal Stasis Fields IS possible.]`
        *   `Authenticated Limit/Cost 2a:` `[e.g., High energy cost; Field instability risk increases with size/duration; Cannot preserve consciousness long-term.]`
        *   `Authenticated Impossibility 1:` `[e.g., True Time Travel (altering authenticated past) IS alethically impossible with known tech.]`
        *   `Authenticated Necessity 1:` `[e.g., All Chrono-Tech operation NECESSARILY incurs Paradox Risk.]`
    *   **(System ID: [e.g., Aberration Biology])**
        *   `Authenticated Possibility 1:` `[e.g., Temporal Phasing through standard matter IS possible for Echo-type Aberrations.]`
        *   `Authenticated Limit/Cost 1a:` `[e.g., Limited duration; Cannot interact physically while phased; Vulnerable to specific fields during phase.]`
        *   `Authenticated Impossibility 1:` `[e.g., Permanent destruction by conventional means IS impossible.]`
    *   **(Define possibilities, necessities, impossibilities, costs, and limits for ALL core speculative systems)**

*   **Section 1.3: Fundamental Life/Death/Consciousness Rules:**
    *   **Authenticated Principle:** `[e.g., Baseline human mortality IS final; no authenticated resurrection exists.]`
    *   **Authenticated Principle:** `[e.g., Automaton consciousness IS NOT standard; emergent sentience IS a rare, authenticated anomaly/glitch, not a designed feature.]`
    *   **Authenticated Principle:** `[e.g., Nature of 'souls' or post-death existence IS epistemically unknown/unauthenticated.]`

*   **# Alethic Design Prompts:**
    *   *What is the single most important physical/metaphysical rule that makes your world unique? How is it clearly authenticated?*
    *   *For every power/possibility introduced, have you authenticated at least two meaningful limitations, costs, or risks?*
    *   *Are there absolute impossibilities that define the boundaries of this reality?*

## Article II: Deontic Modality (The Laws of Obligation & Permission)

*Purpose: Define the core normative frameworks – laws, ethics, codes – governing behavior.*

*   **Section 2.1: Dominant Legal / Political System(s):**
    *   **System Name:** `[e.g., Cogwork Council Law (Surface)]`
    *   `Authenticated Key Obligation 1:` `[e.g., Guilds MUST adhere to Dust Quotas set by Council.]`
    *   `Authenticated Key Prohibition 1:` `[e.g., Unauthorized creation of Paradox Level 3+ Anomalies IS forbidden, punishable by...]`
    *   `Authenticated Key Permission 1:` `[e.g., Guilds ARE permitted internal self-governance regarding non-temporal matters.]`
    *   `Authenticated Enforcement Mechanism:` `[e.g., City Watch (limited); Guild Security (internally); Council Tribunal (major disputes).]`

*   **Section 2.2: Significant Factional / Cultural Codes:**
    *   **System Name:** `[e.g., Chronometers Guild Internal Statutes]`
    *   `Authenticated Key Obligation 1:` `[e.g., Absolute secrecy regarding core temporal research MUST be maintained.]`
    *   `Authenticated Key Prohibition 1:` `[e.g., Collaboration with rival Guilds on sensitive tech IS forbidden.]`
    *   `Authenticated Enforcement Mechanism:` `[e.g., Internal Affairs division, threat of memory wipe.]`
    *   **System Name:** `[e.g., Undercity Salvager Code (Informal)]`
    *   `Authenticated Key Obligation 1:` `[e.g., MUST share immediate, life-threatening hazard info (e.g., Aberration sighting) with nearby allied crews.]`
    *   `Authenticated Key Prohibition 1:` `[e.g., Stealing essential survival gear from another known crew IS taboo.]`
    *   `Authenticated Enforcement Mechanism:` `[e.g., Crew justice, loss of reputation/network access, violence.]`
    *   **(Define codes for other key groups)**

*   **Section 2.3: Core Ethical Principles (Authenticated as Influential):**
    *   **Authenticated Principle:** `[e.g., 'The Greater Good of Order': Justification often used by authorities for restrictive measures.]`
    *   **Authenticated Principle:** `[e.g., 'Sanctity of Authentic Memory': Minority principle held by dissidents opposing Memory Keepers.]`
    *   **Authenticated Principle:** `[e.g., 'Survival At All Costs': Dominant pragmatism in resource-poor areas.]`

*   **# Deontic Design Prompts:**
    *   *What actions are absolutely forbidden in this world, and what are the authenticated consequences?*
    *   *What duties are inescapably tied to specific authenticated social roles?*
    *   *Where do different authenticated codes (e.g., Guild law vs. personal ethics vs. Salvager code) inevitably clash, creating dilemmas?*

## Article III: Axiological Modality (The Laws of Value)

*Purpose: Define the authenticated value hierarchies – what is considered good/bad, desirable/undesirable, etc., *within* the world.*

*   **Section 3.1: Dominant Value Structures:**
    *   **Source/Group:** `[e.g., Guild Establishment]`
    *   `Authenticated Hierarchy (Examples):` `[1. Order/Stability > 2. Control/Managed Knowledge > 3. Efficiency/Guild Prosperity > 4. Individual Well-being (lower rank).]`
    *   `Key Disvalues/Taboos:` `[Chaos, Unpredictability, Wasted Resources, Uncontrolled Truth.]`
    *   **Source/Group:** `[e.g., Undercity Culture]`
    *   `Authenticated Hierarchy (Examples):` `[1. Survival > 2. Crew Loyalty/Trust > 3. Resourcefulness/Autonomy > 4. Mended Beauty/Resilience.]`
    *   `Key Disvalues/Taboos:` `[Surface Authority, Wastefulness, Betrayal, Fragility.]`
    *   **(Define other key value systems)**

*   **Section 3.2: Authenticated Value of Key Concepts/Entities:**
    *   **Element:** `[e.g., Chrono-Dust]` -> `Value Status: [High Utility/Economic; Negative Health/Stability Association]`
    *   **Element:** `[e.g., Artificer Technology]` -> `Value Status: [Ambivalent: High Potential Power/Knowledge; High Risk/Hubris Association]`
    *   **Element:** `[e.g., Memory (Authentic vs. Fabricated)]` -> `Value Status: [Contested: Truth valued by some, Stability via controlled memory valued by others]`
    *   **Element:** `[e.g., Individual Life]` -> `Value Status: [Variable/Stratified based on Guild status/utility]`
    *   **(Assign authenticated value status to other core world elements)**

*   **Section 3.3: World's Moral Compass (Authenticated Basis):**
    *   `[Is morality defined by adherence to specific Deontic codes? By consequences (utilitarianism)? By inherent virtue/nature (axiological essentialism)? By divine will (if applicable)? e.g., Aethelgard features competing systems: Guild consequentialism vs. Undercity survival ethics vs. individualistic truth-seeking.]`

*   **# Axiological Design Prompts:**
    *   *What are characters willing to kill or die for *according to the values authenticated for this world*?*
    *   *What constitutes 'beauty' or 'ugliness' within the dominant aesthetics? How is this shown?*
    *   *How does the narrative itself (through consequences, focus, tone) implicitly authenticate certain values over others?*

---

## Article IV: Epistemic Modality (The Laws of Knowledge & Belief)

*Purpose: Define the authenticated rules governing information, perception, truth, and certainty.*

*   **Section 4.1: Fundamental Limits on Knowledge:**
    *   **Authenticated Limit:** `[e.g., Absolute certainty about Pre-Shattering history IS impossible due to authenticated record loss/manipulation.]`
    *   **Authenticated Limit:** `[e.g., Predicting future events beyond short-term, localized probabilities IS impossible.]`
    *   **Authenticated Limit:** `[e.g., The true nature/motives of Temporal Aberrations ARE currently unknowable via authenticated methods.]`
    *   **(Define other hard limits on what can be known)**

*   **Section 4.2: Authenticated Reliability of Information Sources:**
    *   **Source:** `[e.g., Direct Sensory Perception]` -> `Reliability: [Generally High BUT explicitly vulnerable to authenticated temporal distortions.]`
    *   **Source:** `[e.g., Official Guild Records]` -> `Reliability: [Moderately High for operational data, Low/Suspect for historical/politically sensitive info due to authenticated manipulation potential.]`
    *   **Source:** `[e.g., Chrono-Viewer Echoes]` -> `Reliability: [Moderate but inherently flawed; authenticated degradation, limited scope, requires expert interpretation.]`
    *   **Source:** `[e.g., Undercity Rumor Mill]` -> `Reliability: [Extremely Low; authenticated primarily as reflecting anxieties/beliefs, rarely factual unless corroborated.]`
    *   **(Define reliability for all key info sources)**

*   **Section 4.3: Authenticated Mechanisms of Information Control:**
    *   `[List methods: e.g., Guild Secrecy Oaths, Restricted Archives, Council Propaganda (Chronocasts), Memory Keeper Redaction/Manipulation, Technological Surveillance/Censorship, Destruction of Evidence.]`

*   **Section 4.4: Basis for Justified Belief (Internal):**
    *   `[What constitutes a 'reasonable' belief *within Aethelgard*? e.g., Heavy reliance on direct observation and trusted personal networks due to unreliable institutions; Guild members trust authenticated Guild data more; Undercity trusts demonstrated survival skill over official reports.]`

*   **# Epistemic Design Prompts:**
    *   *How easy or difficult is it for a typical inhabitant to discover the 'truth' about important matters?*
    *   *What specific mechanisms of deception or misinformation are authenticated within the world?*
    *   *How do epistemic limitations create specific types of narrative challenges (e.g., investigation, navigating propaganda)?*

---

## V. Modal Interplay & World Signature

*Purpose: Briefly consider how the different modalities interact to create Aethelgard's unique operational logic.*

*   **Key Interaction 1:** `[e.g., Alethic risk of Paradox heavily influences Deontic laws restricting Chrono-Tech use.]`
*   **Key Interaction 2:** `[e.g., Epistemic uncertainty about history fuels Axiological conflict over how to value the past (preserve vs. control vs. ignore).]`
*   **Key Interaction 3:** `[e.g., Deontic structure (Guild hierarchy) interacts with Economic state (Dust control) to create Axiological reality of social inequality.]`
*   **Dominant Modalities:** `[Which modalities feel most defining for Aethelgard? e.g., Alethic (temporal instability limits everything) and Epistemic (contested history/truth) seem dominant, shaping the Noir/Mystery feel.]`
*   **Resulting World Signature:** `[Summarize the unique 'feel' arising from this configuration. e.g., A world where reality itself is unstable, knowledge is power but deeply unreliable, order is obsessively pursued but constantly undermined by temporal chaos and human fallibility, and survival often requires navigating complex ethical grey areas.]`

*   **# Interplay Prompt:** *Identify a scenario where a character faces a choice involving conflict between at least three different modalities (e.g., doing what is *possible* vs. what is *permitted* vs. what is *valued* based on *limited knowledge*).*

**How This YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Modalities:**

1.  **Constitutional Framing:** Explicitly uses Articles and Sections, framing modalities as the world's foundational "Statutes" or "Constitution."
2.  **Rigorous Definition:** Demands explicit authentication for *each* core principle within *each* modality, including its implications and consistency notes. Requires moving beyond general statements to specific rules.
3.  **Granular Scope:** Breaks down each modality into detailed sub-aspects (e.g., Alethic covers physics, tech, biology, metaphysics, temporality; Deontic covers legal, factional, social norms).
4.  **Emphasis on Authentication Method:** Implicitly requires thought about *how* these abstract rules are made concrete and validated within the narrative (explicit statement, consistent pattern, etc.).
5.  **Focus on Limits & Consequences:** Demands clear definition of impossibilities, costs, risks, prohibitions, disvalues, and knowledge limits alongside possibilities, permissions, and values.
6.  **Systemic Interplay Included:** Explicitly includes a section to analyze and define the *interaction* between modalities, crucial for deep world logic.
7.  **Detailed Prompts:** Uses highly specific prompts to force deep consideration of the implications and consistency of each modal rule within the Aethelgard context.
8.  **World Signature Articulation:** Requires synthesizing the overall *feel* and operational logic emerging from the specific modal configuration.

This extremely detailed YAML template provides a powerful framework for meticulously designing and documenting the fundamental operating system of Aethelgard, ensuring its internal logic is robust, consistent, unique, and capable of generating rich narrative and thematic possibilities.
