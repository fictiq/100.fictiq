# Story World Codex: Creator's Mandate & World Constitution Summary
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's World-Legislator Conclusion)

# ============================================================

# --- Preamble: Legislating the Heterocosm of Aethelgard ---
preamble:
  purpose: |
    This document serves as the **Foundational Charter and Supreme Constitution** for the Aethelgard heterocosm. 
    It formally articulates the core legislative acts performed by the **Sovereign Authenticator(s)** 
    (the authorial function operating through ratified canonical texts and codified via the Master Codex) 
    in defining this world's unique reality. 
  theoretical_basis: |
    Grounded in Doležel's semantic theory, this document recognizes world-building not as mere description 
    or imitation, but as a profound act of **legislating existence, essence, possibility, necessity, 
    obligation, value, knowledge, history, and context** through the power of **authenticated constitutive 
    predication**.
  commitment: |
    We hereby affirm the commitment to constructing and maintaining Aethelgard as a **coherent, resonant, 
    purposeful, and internally consistent semantic architecture**, acknowledging the significant creative 
    responsibilities inherent in wielding the power to forge 'other worlds' through language.

# --- Article I: Core World Identity & Legislative Intent ---
# Purpose: Define the immutable 'spirit of the law' – the foundational vision, themes, and aesthetic reality 
#          that all subsequent legislation (authentication) must serve.
article_I_identity_intent:
  section_1_1_foundational_concept:
    title: "The Authenticated Essence of Aethelgard"
    definition: |
      Aethelgard is hereby legislated into existence as a **Chrono-Noir heterocosm**, a universe fundamentally 
      defined by the **ontological friction between intricate clockwork order and pervasive temporal decay**. 
      Its reality is shaped by the inescapable **legacy of the Shattering**, a past cataclysm whose fallout 
      (Chrono-Dust, Aberrations, fragmented history) constantly intrudes upon a present obsessed with 
      mechanical precision and societal control. It is a world where **memory itself is a contested territory**, 
      identity is fluid and potentially fabricated, and the very fabric of time is perceived as both a resource 
      and an existential threat.
    core_descriptors: "[Chrono-Noir, Steampunk Decay, Temporal Instability, Contested Memory, Order/Chaos Tension, Post-Cataclysm Reconstruction]"

  section_1_2_primary_thematic_mandate:
    title: "The Core Thematic Inquiries Legislated into the World's Structure"
    description: "The architecture of Aethelgard is purposefully designed to inherently explore and interrogate:"
    thematic_inquiries:
      - theme: "Memory & Identity"
        questions: "[What constitutes self when memory is unreliable/manipulable/artificial? Can identity survive memory loss? Is collective history truth or fabrication? What are the ethics of memory alteration?]"
      - theme: "Order vs. Chaos"
        questions: "[What are the costs and limits of imposing mechanical/social order on inherently chaotic systems (time, human nature)? Is rigid control preferable to unpredictable freedom? Can true stability exist under the Shattered Moon?]"
      - theme: "Legacy & Consequence"
        questions: "[How do inescapable past traumas (The Shattering) dictate present constraints and conflicts? Can societies or individuals break from destructive historical cycles? What are the unforeseen consequences of past technological/political choices?]"
      - theme: "Nature of Time"
        questions: "[Within Aethelgard's specific rules, is time fundamentally linear despite local flux? What defines causality when observation is limited and paradox looms? What are the philosophical/ethical implications of harnessing temporal energy?]"
      - theme: "Beauty in Imperfection / Resilience"
        questions: "[Where is value found in a broken world? Can functional repair and adaptation achieve their own form of beauty? How does life persist and find meaning amidst decay and instability?]"
    # - Add other core thematic inquiries...

  section_1_3_dominant_tone_aesthetic_constitution:
    title: "The Authenticated Sensory & Affective Reality"
    definition: |
      Aethelgard's experiential quality is legislated as **predominantly Steampunk Noir**. This entails:
      - **Visuals:** Dominated by contrasts - intricate brass/clockwork vs. rust/decay; deep shadows vs. flickering gaslight/lumen-globes/temporal glows; oppressive architecture vs. evidence of constant repair. Muted palettes prevail, punctuated by specific energy signatures (iridescent blues/purples) and grime.
      - **Auditory:** A pervasive soundscape blending the rhythmic (ticking, gears, pumps) with the arrhythmic (glitches, anomalous echoes, dripping water, distant alarms), often creating unease. Silence is rare and often feels heavy/suspicious.
      - **Olfactory/Tactile:** Dominated by dampness, cold metal, ozone, industrial emissions (oil, coal, chemicals), dust, decay, and the unique metallic tang/cool feel of Chrono-Dust.
      - **Atmosphere:** Primarily melancholic, anxious, intriguing, suspicious, with undercurrents of weary resilience and the potential for sudden temporal horror or moments of complex, broken beauty.
    consistency_mandate: "All canonical depictions across media must adhere to and reinforce this established sensory and atmospheric constitution."

  legislative_note_I: "These Identity elements form the 'spirit' guiding all further legislative acts (authentications) within the heterocosm."

# --- Article II: Fundamental Laws of Reality (The Modal Constitution) ---
# Purpose: Codify the supreme, non-negotiable governing modalities defining the operational logic of Aethelgard. These are the foundational statutes.
article_II_modal_constitution:
  
  section_2_1_alethic_laws: # Possibility / Necessity / Impossibility
    title: "Statutes of Possibility and Physical/Metaphysical Necessity"
    authenticated_principles:
      - principle_id: "ALETHIC_LAW_001"
        statement: "Temporal Manipulation Limits: Chrono-Tech **permits only localized observation, recording (flawed), and minor perturbation (stutter, brief stasis)** of the temporal stream. True **retro-causality (changing the authenticated past) or forward causality violation (true time travel) is alethically impossible** under current principles."
        implication: "Focuses narrative on dealing with consequences, not undoing them. Elevates historical mystery."
      - principle_id: "ALETHIC_LAW_002"
        statement: "Paradox Inevitability & Escalation: Any attempt to significantly perturb local time or create causal loops via Chrono-Tech carries an **inherent and exponentially increasing risk** of generating **Temporal Instability, attracting Temporal Aberrations, and potentially causing localized reality fragmentation/erasure**."
        implication: "Establishes core danger/cost of core tech; provides mechanism for conflict/horror; limits power scaling."
      - principle_id: "ALETHIC_LAW_003"
        statement: "Chrono-Dust Properties: **Is the sole known fuel source** for Chrono-Tech; **is inherently unstable** raw; **degrades** when refined/used; **causes Temporal Sickness** (cumulative physiological/neurological damage) with prolonged/intense exposure."
        implication: "Creates resource dependency/conflict; adds biological cost/risk to tech use; explains tech unreliability."
      - principle_id: "ALETHIC_LAW_004"
        statement: "Aberration Ontology: Temporal Aberrations **cannot be destroyed by conventional physical means** due to their temporally displaced/phasing nature; **can be temporarily dispersed, contained, or repelled** by specific, authenticated methods (e.g., resonance frequencies, high-energy temporal fields)."
        implication: "Defines unique threat requiring non-standard solutions; reinforces danger of temporal instability."
      - principle_id: "ALETHIC_LAW_005"
        statement: "Baseline Reality: Barring specific authenticated Chrono-Tech effects, Aberration influence, or unique entity properties, the heterocosm **operates under physical laws generally analogous to the presumed Actual World** (gravity, basic mechanics, biology)."
        implication: "Provides familiar baseline, making deviations more impactful; grounds steampunk elements."
      - principle_id: "ALETHIC_LAW_006"
        statement: "Artificer Tech Exception (Mysterious): Pre-Shattering Artificer artifacts *may* operate on **unknown principles potentially transcending current alethic limits**, but their function is authenticated as **unreliable, dangerous, and poorly understood**."
        implication: "Allows for specific MacGuffins/plot devices that bend rules slightly, but frames them as exceptional and mysterious, preserving general consistency."
    # --- Add other core alethic laws ---

  section_2_2_deontic_laws: # Obligation / Permission / Prohibition
    title: "Statutes of Social, Legal, and Ethical Order"
    authenticated_principles:
      - principle_id: "DEONTIC_LAW_001"
        statement: "Guild Authority & Secrecy: Major Guilds hold **legislated (via Compact/Council Edicts) and de facto control** over their specific domains (Dust, Mechanics, Memory). **Sharing proprietary knowledge/tech outside the Guild is strictly prohibited** and severely punished (often via Memory Wipe)."
        implication: "Establishes primary power structure, source of political conflict, justification for information control."
      - principle_id: "DEONTIC_LAW_002"
        statement: "Council Authority (Limited): The Cogwork Council holds **nominal authority** over inter-Guild disputes and city-wide regulations (e.g., curfews, resource quotas) but **enforcement capability is limited** by Guild influence and City Watch resources."
        implication: "Creates tension between official law and realpolitik; allows for Guilds bypassing Council."
      - principle_id: "DEONTIC_LAW_003"
        statement: "Undercity Autonomy & Code: The Deep Undercity largely **operates outside official law**. Loose codes emphasizing **crew loyalty, salvage rights (often contested), and mutual defense against Aberrations/Watch incursions** prevail, enforced by reputation and violence."
        implication: "Creates distinct social/legal zone; source of conflict/alliances; allows for different character archetypes."
      - principle_id: "DEONTIC_LAW_004"
        statement: "Temporal Manipulation Restrictions: Use of Chrono-Tech for **significant personal gain, unauthorized historical viewing, deliberate paradox creation, or weaponization** is **universally prohibited** by Council/Guild law and carries extreme sanctions."
        implication: "Establishes ethical boundaries around core tech; creates high-stakes transgressions."
    # --- Add other core deontic laws (e.g., property rights, specific social taboos) ---

  section_2_3_axiological_laws: # Core Value Hierarchies
    title: "Authenticated Principles of Value and Disvalue"
    authenticated_principles:
      - principle_id: "AXIO_LAW_001"
        statement: "Order & Control vs. Chaos & Decay: **Order, precision, predictability, and control** are highly valued by the ruling Guild structure as necessary defenses against temporal/social chaos. **Chaos, unpredictability, decay** are generally viewed negatively/fearfully by the establishment."
        implication: "Establishes core ideological conflict; justifies Guild actions (in their view); frames Aberrations/instability as 'evil'."
      - principle_id: "AXIO_LAW_002"
        statement: "Resilience & Functionality vs. Obsolescence & Waste: **Resourcefulness, repair, adaptation, and finding function in broken things** ('Beauty in Imperfection') are highly valued, especially in Undercity/artisan circles. **Waste, planned obsolescence, or reliance on fragile 'perfect' systems** are viewed negatively/impractically."
        implication: "Provides thematic counterpoint to pure Order; justifies steampunk aesthetic of repair; values survival ingenuity."
      - principle_id: "AXIO_LAW_003"
        statement: "Knowledge & Truth (Contested Value): While Guilds value *controlled* knowledge, **unfettered access to historical truth or dangerous Artificer knowledge** is often viewed as destabilizing and taboo. Truth-seeking is both heroic (for protagonists) and subversive (to the establishment)."
        implication: "Creates central conflict around information; makes investigation inherently political/dangerous; complicates simple 'knowledge = good' value."
    # --- Add other core axiological principles ---

  section_2_4_epistemic_laws: # Knowledge / Belief / Information Access
    title: "Statutes Governing Knowledge and Belief"
    authenticated_principles:
      - principle_id: "EPI_LAW_001"
        statement: "Historical Knowledge = Fragmented & Unreliable: Authenticated that the **true Pre-Shattering history and the exact cause of the Shattering are largely unknown/lost**. Existing records (Guild/Memory Keeper) are **potentially biased, incomplete, or deliberately manipulated**."
        implication: "Makes discovering the past a core challenge/mystery; justifies Memory Keepers' power/suspicion; forces reliance on deduction/archaeology."
      - principle_id: "EPI_LAW_002"
        statement: "Information Control = Systemic: Access to advanced Chrono-Tech knowledge, detailed historical archives, Guild internal data, and city-wide surveillance feeds **is strictly controlled** by relevant authorities."
        implication: "Creates information scarcity; makes espionage/hacking necessary plot devices; reinforces power structures."
      - principle_id: "EPI_LAW_003"
        statement: "Perception Vulnerability: Direct sensory perception **is generally reliable but demonstrably vulnerable** to distortion by authenticated temporal anomalies, Aberration influence, or specific Chrono-Tech effects (including memory manipulation)."
        implication: "Undermines absolute certainty even of direct experience; fuels paranoia; allows for unreliable subjective viewpoints within narratives."
      - principle_id: "EPI_LAW_004"
        statement: "Limits of Prediction: While Chronometers Guild attempts temporal analysis/prediction, **true prophecy is not an authenticated possibility**, and long-range prediction is **highly unreliable** due to chaotic variables and paradox feedback."
        implication: "Maintains narrative suspense; prevents easy 'destiny' plots; emphasizes dealing with present based on limited foresight."
    # --- Add other core epistemic constraints ---

  legislative_note_II: "These Modal Laws are the bedrock reality. Their consistent application across all authenticated phenomena is the primary measure of heterocosmic coherence."

# --- III. Foundational Historical & Contextual Edicts ---

      # - Add other essential parameters defining the 'Now'...

  legislative_note_III: "These historical and state edicts provide the fixed stage and background. Narratives must operate within and respect this authenticated context."

# --- IV. Principles of Ongoing World Legislation & Creative Governance ---
# Purpose: Guide the Sovereign Authenticator(s) in the ongoing development and maintenance of the heterocosm, ensuring adherence to the established constitution.
article_IV_ongoing_legislation_principles:
  
  section_4_1_primacy_of_coherence:
    principle: "Internal Coherence Uber Alles."
    directive: |
      All new authentications (plot points, character developments, lore additions, rule clarifications) MUST be rigorously checked for logical consistency with the entirety of the established Canon as documented in the Codex (esp. Articles II & III). Coherence overrides creative convenience or novelty.

  section_4_2_respect_for_autonomy_emergence:
    principle: "Listen to the World's Logic."
    directive: |
      Recognize that the established system possesses emergent properties and logical consequences. New developments should ideally arise organically from, or respond plausibly to, the existing architecture. Avoid arbitrary interventions that violate the world's established nature.

  section_4_3_purposeful_design_mandate:
    principle: "Legislate with Intent."
    directive: |
      Ensure all significant new authentications serve a clear Narrative Function (advancing plot, developing character, creating meaningful conflict) AND/OR Thematic Function (exploring core themes). Avoid authenticating extraneous detail ('worldbuilder's disease') that doesn't contribute systemically or meaningfully.

  section_4_4_strategic_undersaturation_management:
    principle: "Master the Known Unknowns."
    directive: |
      Maintain control over areas designated as intentionally ambiguous or undersaturated (Core Mysteries, etc.). Decisions to saturate these areas (reveal mysteries) must be made deliberately by the CAA, considering long-term narrative/thematic impact. Preserve necessary gaps.

  section_4_5_retcon_austerity:
    principle: "Amend the Constitution Only When Imperative."
    directive: |
      Adhere strictly to the formal Retcon Policy. Changes to established Tier 1/2 Canon require extraordinary justification proving necessity for the world's overall health and future potential, demonstrating minimal disruption and maintaining maximum possible coherence.

  legislative_note_IV: "These principles guide the CAA/Authorial Function in its ongoing duty to govern the heterocosm responsibly, balancing creative evolution with structural integrity."

# --- V. Manifestation & Documentation: The Codex as Supreme Law ---
# Purpose: Irrevocably establish the Master Codex as the sole, binding repository of all authenticated world legislation.
article_V_codex_supremacy:

  section_5_1_codex_as_ultimate_authority:
    statement: |
      The **Aethelgard Master Codex System (AMCS)**, as maintained by the Keeper under CAA oversight, IS the **sole and supreme repository and arbiter of authenticated canon**. It embodies the complete and current legislative reality of the heterocosm.

  section_5_2_mandate_for_codification:
    statement: |
      All principles outlined in this Constitution (Articles I-IV) and all subsequent canonical rulings, authentications, clarifications, or ratified retcons by the CAA **MUST be accurately, promptly, and unambiguously codified** within the AMCS. Uncodified 'canon' lacks official standing.

  section_5_3_obligation_of_adherence:
    statement: |
      All contributors, at all stages of creation and production, are **bound by the authenticated content of the current, ratified version of the AMCS**. Consultation is mandatory; deviation without formal CAA approval constitutes a breach of canonical integrity.

  legislative_note_V: "The written law of Aethelgard resides exclusively within the Codex. Its integrity and authority are paramount."

# --- Conclusion: The Sovereign Authenticator's Enduring Responsibility ---
conclusion:
  final_affirmation: |
    We, the designated Sovereign Authenticator(s) of the Aethelgard heterocosm, hereby ratify this Constitution. We affirm our understanding of the profound power inherent in **legislating fictional reality** through **authenticated constitutive predication**. We accept the **responsibility** that accompanies this power – the duty to maintain **internal coherence**, foster **systemic richness**, ensure **purposeful design**, respect **world autonomy**, and guide the heterocosm's evolution with **wisdom and foresight**.
  vision_statement: |
    Our commitment is to wield this legislative authority not arbitrarily, but in service of creating and sustaining Aethelgard as a compelling, believable, resonant, and enduring **architecture of meaning**. We pledge to uphold the principles herein, ensuring the world remains a consistent, integrated, and powerful semantic universe for all who create within it and all who experience it. The laws are set; the architecture stands.

# End of Aethelgard World Constitution Summary v1.1 (Extreme Detail)
# ============================================================


How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for the World-Legislator Concept:

Formal Constitutional Language: Uses strong legislative/constitutional terminology throughout ("Preamble," "Articles," "Sections," "Statutes," "Mandate," "Ratified," "Supreme Authority," "Binding," "Legislative Intent," "Edicts").

Explicit Theoretical Grounding: Continuously references the Doležel-inspired principles (authentication, predication, modalities, heterocosm, coherence, autonomy) as the basis for the legislated reality.

Granular Modal Laws: Section II demands detailed articulation of specific core rules within each modality, framing them explicitly as "Statutes."

Immutable Foundations: Section III designates specific historical events and present states as "Immutable" or "Legislated Cornerstones," emphasizing the Sovereign Authenticator's power to fix core realities.

Rigorous Governance Principles: Section IV outlines detailed principles for how the authorial function should govern ongoing creation, emphasizing responsibility alongside power.

Codex as Supreme Law: Section V elevates the Codex beyond a mere record to the status of Supreme Law, making adherence non-negotiable and defining its absolute authority.

Concluding Pledge: The conclusion frames the entire document as a formal pledge by the Sovereign Authenticator(s) to uphold the principles of coherent, purposeful world legislation.

Emphasis on Responsibility: Throughout, the document balances the immense power of the World-Legislator with the profound responsibility required to wield it effectively and maintain the integrity of the created reality.

This extremely detailed YAML serves as a powerful foundational document, encouraging the creator(s) to fully embrace the implications of their role as legislators of their fictional universe, demanding rigor, purpose, and deep consideration in every act of world-building authentication.
