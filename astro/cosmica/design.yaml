# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol translates the theoretical implications of Doležel's framework into practical considerations 
    for **world-building and narrative design**, with a specific, integrated emphasis on leveraging 
    **extreme and evocative sensory details** as a core part of the design strategy. 
    It guides the conscious authentication of facts, rules, history, states, and entities, ensuring 
    that the resulting heterocosm is coherent, engaging, thematically resonant, and sensorially immersive.
  focus_note: |
    Treat every design choice as an act of **authenticating sensory reality**. Consider the sight, sound, 
    smell, taste, touch, and atmospheric feel inherent in every element. Use this guide to ensure 
    sensory details are purposeful, consistent, and contribute powerfully to the Story World.

# --- I. World-Building as Strategic Sensory Authentication ---
strategic_sensory_authentication:
  purpose: |
    Recognize world-building as the strategic authentication of facts, including sensory reality. 
    Control the flow and nature of authenticated sensory information to shape experience.
  
  key_design_questions:
    - "What core sensory signatures (dominant visual palette, soundscape, smells, textures, atmospheric feel) are essential to authenticate upfront for world identity (e.g., Aethelgard's damp chill, brass/verdigris visuals, clockwork sounds, ozone/rust smells)?"
    - "How will information be authenticated *sensorially* within the narrative (vivid description, character sensory reactions, diegetic sound cues, visual storytelling in environments/props)?"
    - "What sensory details will remain intentionally ambiguous, distorted, or unauthenticated to create mystery, unease, or reflect the world's nature (e.g., the indescribable *smell* of paradox, the *visually confusing* nature of temporal anomalies, the *unsettling silence* of certain locations)?"
    - "How will the narrative strategically control *sensory focus* (emphasizing sound in darkness, tactile detail during close investigation, overwhelming visual spectacle during action)?"
    - "If sensory realities change (environment improves, tech evolves), how will this sensory shift be clearly and consistently authenticated?"

  actionable_design_principles:
    - "Authenticate Senses Deliberately: Choose specific, unique sensory details as core facts of your world."
    - "Employ Multi-Sensory Storytelling: Actively engage multiple senses in descriptions and narrative events."
    - "Master Sensory Undersaturation: Use the *absence* of expected sensory detail (silence, scentlessness, featurelessness) just as purposefully as its presence."
    - "Pace Sensory Reveals: Control the introduction of key sensory elements to build atmosphere, suspense, or wonder."
    - "Design Sensory Evolution: Plan how the world's sensory profile might change over time and authenticate these shifts believably."

  codex_link: "Ensure World Bible explicitly records core sensory palettes, entity signatures, and rules governing sensory phenomena."

# --- II. Designing History for Sensory Resonance & Legacy ---
designing_sensory_history:
  purpose: |
    Design the authenticated past so its impact resonates sensorially in the narrative present, creating depth, context, and tangible connections.
  
  key_design_questions:
    - "What distinct *sensory characteristics* are authenticated for different historical eras (e.g., the *sound* of Mythic Age tech vs. Dark Year survival tools; the *visual style* of Reconstruction architecture)?"
    - "How do major historical events leave lasting *sensory scars* or *legacies* on the present environment (e.g., battlefields that *feel* different, ruins emitting specific *sounds* or *smells*, pollution layers *visible* in geology)?"
    - "How is history *authenticated sensorially* within the narrative 'Now' (e.g., ancient texts with unique *smell/texture*, artifacts with specific *tactile/visual* properties, ruins with distinct *acoustic* qualities, memory tech replaying sensory fragments)?"
    - "Do conflicting historical accounts manifest in contradictory *sensory evidence* (e.g., one source describes an event with sounds of glory, another with sounds of terror)?"
    - "What lingering *sensory details* (a specific scent, a visual motif, a recurring sound) associated with historical figures persist in folklore, artifacts, or locations?"
    - "How does *sensory deprivation* (e.g., destruction of beautiful architecture, silencing of past music) signify historical loss or oppression?"

  actionable_design_principles:
    - "Embed Sensory History: Weave sensory details reflecting the past into descriptions of present people, places, and objects."
    - "Create Sensory Artifacts/Ruins: Design historical remnants whose unique sensory properties serve as clues or sources of atmosphere/mystery."
    - "Contrast Eras Sensorially: Use distinct sensory palettes and signatures when depicting or referencing different time periods."
    *   - "Make History Palpable: Focus on how the past *feels* – the texture of old objects, the temperature of ruins, the atmospheric weight of historical sites."
    - "Authenticate Sensory Folklore: Incorporate believable in-world beliefs about the sensory traces left by history."

  codex_link: "Integrate sensory legacies into the Historical Authentication Protocol for eras, events, and figures."

# --- III. Designing Global States for Immersive Sensory Environments ---
designing_sensory_states:
  purpose: |
    Authenticate the prevailing conditions ('Now') by defining their pervasive sensory characteristics, creating immersive and context-rich environments.
  
  key_design_questions:
    - "What are the unavoidable, dominant *sensory experiences* defining the current political state (e.g., *sound* of omnipresent surveillance, *visual* impact of propaganda/control, *feel* of checkpoints/barriers)?"
    *   - "How does the social structure manifest sensorially (e.g., distinct *smells*, *textures*, *soundscapes* associated with different classes/districts)?"
    *   - "What are the daily *sensory realities* imposed by the economic state (e.g., *taste/smell/look* of common food, *sound/feel* of prevalent labor, *sensory contrast* between markets)?"
    *   - "How does the environmental state constantly bombard the senses (e.g., *feel* of the weather, *smell/taste* of air/water, *visual* obscurity/clarity, *sound* of hazards)?"
    *   - "What is the *ambient sensory footprint* of the world's core technology/magic (e.g., background *hum/hiss/clicks*, common *visual* energy signatures, pervasive *smells*)?"
    *   - "How is the overall atmospheric mood (tension, decay, wonder) authenticated through specific, concrete *sensory details* (light quality, ambient sounds, temperature, specific smells)?"

  actionable_design_principles:
    - "Define Dominant Sensory Signatures for States:** Identify the key sensory experiences associated with each major global condition."
    - "World-Build Through Sensory Detail:** Use recurring, specific sensory details to consistently reinforce the prevailing states.
    - "Contrast Sensory Environments:** Make districts, social strata, or safe/dangerous zones feel sensorially distinct based on global conditions.
    - "Show Mood Sensorially:** Authenticate atmosphere through tangible sensory description, not just abstract mood words.
    - "Consider Systemic Sensory Interaction:** How does the smell of industry (Economic) combine with the sound of rain (Environmental) and the visual of patrols (Political) to create the *total* sensory experience of a specific street corner?"

  codex_link: "Ensure the Global States Protocol is rich with specific, authenticated sensory details defining the 'Now'."

# --- IV. Designing Individuals Within the Sensory System ---
designing_sensory_individuals:
  purpose: |
    Create entities whose authenticated properties reflect their sensory environment and whose unique sensory perceptions can reveal the world.
  
  key_design_questions:
    - "How do characters' physical traits (*visual scars, tactile augmentations, species-specific sensory organs*) reflect their history within Aethelgard's demanding sensory environment?"
    - "How do skills/abilities manifest sensorially (*visual effects* of Chrono-Tech, *sound* of lockpicking, *feel* of wielding specific weapons/tools)?"
    *   - "How are psychological states expressed through authenticated sensory cues (*audible* nervous ticks, *visible* changes in eye glow intensity, stress-induced *scent* markers - if applicable)?
    *   - "How does a character's origin (Guild, Undercity) shape their baseline *sensory perception* and *reactions* to the world's stimuli (e.g., tolerance for noise/smells, ability to navigate low light)?"
    *   - "Can characters possess unique, authenticated sensory abilities (enhanced hearing, temporal 'after-sight', ability to 'smell' fear/magic) that provide different perspectives on the world?"
    *   - "What constitutes the unique *sensory signature* of key characters/creatures?"

  actionable_design_principles:
    - "Ground Characters Sensorially:** Link properties to the world's sensory realities (e.g., Undercity dwellers likely have better low-light vision or tolerance for bad air)."
    - "Sensory Characterization:** Use sensory details (voice tone, posture, habitual sounds, personal scent profile if relevant) as key parts of character identity.
    - "Design Unique Sensory POVs:** Explore how the world feels/looks/sounds different through the senses of different characters or species.
    - "Authenticate Special Senses Consistently:** If a character has enhanced or altered senses, define the rules and limitations clearly.
    - "Show, Don't Just Tell Perception:** Describe *what* the character senses, not just that they 'perceived keenly'.

  codex_link: "Integrate sensory details and unique perceptions thoroughly into Entity Profiles."

# --- V. Leveraging Sensory Authentication for Narrative Effect ---
sensory_narrative_effects:
  purpose: |
    Consciously manipulate the authentication and presentation of sensory information to create suspense, mystery, irony, atmosphere, and control pacing.
  
  key_design_questions:
    *   - "How can **withholding** specific sensory details (e.g., describing a threat only by its unsettling *sound* or *smell*) build suspense?"
    *   - "How can sensory **overload** (a cacophony of sounds, overwhelming smells, chaotic visuals) be used to convey panic, trauma, or the intensity of an experience?"
    *   - "Can **unreliable sensory narration** (a character misinterpreting sounds, hallucinating smells, describing beauty where decay exists) create intrigue or thematic depth? How is the unreliability itself signaled (perhaps through subtle sensory dissonance)?"
    *   - "How can sensory details create **dramatic irony** (e.g., the audience sees a faint *visual* danger the character doesn't notice; a character enjoys a *taste* the audience knows is poisoned)?"
    *   - "How can shifts in **sensory focus** (from wide visual shot to intense tactile detail; from ambient soundscape to a single critical whisper) control narrative pacing and emotional impact?"
    *   - "How can **sensory ambiguity** (an unidentifiable sound, a familiar scent in the wrong place, a distorted reflection) generate unease and drive investigation?"

  actionable_design_principles:
    - "Pace Sensory Information:** Reveal key sensory details strategically for effect.
    - "Orchestrate Sensory Focus:** Guide the audience's attention through deliberate sensory description.
    - "Explore Subjective Sensation:** Use character POV to present potentially unreliable or emotionally charged sensory experiences.
    - "Contrast Sensory Perspectives:** Show the same event through different characters' sensory filters.
    - "Design Key Sensory Scenes:** Craft moments where the sensory experience is paramount to the plot or theme.

  codex_link: "Note planned sensory reveals, unreliable sensory perspectives, or key atmospheric sequences in narrative outlines or scene descriptions."

# --- VI. Designing for Sensory Engagement by the Audience ---
designing_sensory_engagement:
  purpose: |
    Structure the world's sensory landscape to invite audience interpretation, exploration, appreciation, and creative response.
  
  key_design_questions:
    *   - "Are there recurring **sensory motifs or patterns** (a specific chime sequence, a unique visual symbol, a recurring smell associated with danger) that reward attentive audiences across narratives/platforms?"
    *   - "Does the world offer distinct, **sensorially evocative environments** (the echoing Undercity, the humming Orrery District, the Glitch Mare) that inspire exploration (in games) or imagination (in text/film)?"
    *   - "Is the **sensory logic** of the world (how Chrono-Tech sounds/looks, how anomalies feel) consistent enough to allow audiences to make informed deductions and meaningful theories?"
    *   - "Are there **sensory gaps** (e.g., undefined tastes, textures of rare materials, sounds of mythical creatures) that provide natural prompts for fan art, fiction, or speculation?"
    *   - "If using transmedia, how are **unique sensory experiences** offered by each platform (VR tactility, novelistic olfactory description, game sound design) integrated to create a richer whole?"

  actionable_design_principles:
    - "Seed Sensory Clues & Motifs:** Embed subtle but consistent sensory details with potential significance.
    - "Craft Memorable Sensory Atmospheres:** Design locations with strong, unique sensory identities.
    - "Maintain Sensory Rule Consistency:** Ensure the 'laws' of how things look, sound, and feel in your world are reliably applied.
    - "Inspire Through Rich Description:** Provide vivid sensory details but leave some aspects open for audience imagination and fan creation.
    - "Platform-Specific Sensory Strengths:** Leverage each medium's ability to deliver unique sensory experiences in a transmedia plan.

  codex_link: "Cross-reference engagement strategies with key sensory hooks. Track sensory motifs/rules rigorously in the World Bible."

# --- VII. The World Bible/Codex as Sensory Encyclopedia & Consistency Tool ---
codex_as_sensory_guide:
  purpose: |
    Utilize the Codex as the active repository of authenticated sensory truths, ensuring consistency and guiding all creative sensory choices.
  
  key_design_questions:
    - "Does the Codex contain **sensory palettes/signatures** for the overall world, key factions, locations, and entity types?"
    - "Are specific, authenticated sensory details (**visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, atmospheric**) integrated directly into relevant Entity Profiles and Location Descriptions?"
    *   - "Does the Codex clearly document the authenticated sensory **manifestations and side-effects** of core world mechanics (Chrono-Tech, temporal anomalies)?"
    *   - "Is there a process for recording and authenticating **new sensory details** introduced in narratives, ensuring they don't contradict established sensory logic?"
    *   - "Can creators across different disciplines (art, sound, writing, level design) easily access and reference the authenticated sensory information to maintain continuity?"

  actionable_design_principles:
    - **Prioritize Sensory Recording:** Treat defining sensory details as crucial canonical information alongside facts and rules.
    - **Develop Sensory Lexicon:** Define unique sensory terms/experiences ("temporal shimmer," "paradox scent").
    - **Link to Assets:** Connect Codex entries to concept art, mood boards, sound effect libraries where feasible.
    - **Sensory Review Pass:** Include a specific check against the Codex's sensory guidelines during creative reviews.
    - **Codex as Shared Sensory Language:** Use the Codex to establish a common understanding of how Aethelgard should look, sound, smell, and feel.

  codex_link: "This entire protocol emphasizes integrating sensory detail into the Codex structure. Ensure dedicated fields or sections exist for sensory information."

# --- Conclusion ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    By consciously applying these principles, focusing on the **strategic authentication of extreme sensory detail** 
    across history, global states, individuals, and narrative design, creators can build a heterocosm that is 
    profoundly immersive and engaging. This approach leverages Doležel's framework to move beyond logical 
    coherence towards crafting a **visceral, lived experience** for the audience, making the Story World 
    not just intellectually intriguing but sensorially unforgettable.

How this YAML Integrates Sensory Detail into Design Implications:

Sensory Keywords: Sections now explicitly include terms like "Sensory Authentication," "Sensory Resonance," "Sensory Environments," "Sensory Signatures," "Sensory Constraints," etc.

Direct Sensory Questions: The "Key Design Questions" in each section are rephrased to directly ask about the sensory implications or manifestations of the design element.

Sensory-Focused Principles: The "Actionable Design Principles" include specific advice on how to design with senses in mind (e.g., "Authenticate Senses Deliberately," "Make History Palpable," "Show Mood Sensorially," "Ground Characters Sensorially").

Integrated Examples: The brief examples within the structure hint at how sensory details can fulfill the strategic purpose of each section (e.g., sensory details revealing history, sensory environments constraining characters).

Codex as Sensory Tool: Section VII explicitly frames the World Bible/Codex as needing to function as a sensory reference guide.

This YAML structure encourages a holistic design process where the world's logic, history, social structures, and sensory reality are developed in tandem, resulting in a deeply coherent and powerfully immersive heterocosm like Aethelgard.
