# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly detailed framework** for establishing and maintaining 
    the **fundamental ontology** governing all entities within the Aethelgard heterocosm. It rigorously 
    applies the ontological consequences derived from Doležel's semantic theory, focusing on the specific 
    nature of **Persons, Objects, and Places** as purely **textually constituted realities**.
  scope: |
    Mandatory foundational document guiding all entity creation, description, representation, and analysis 
    across all canonical media. Ensures a consistent, theoretically sound understanding of *what it means 
    to be* an entity within Aethelgard, preventing metaphysical drift and interpretive fallacies.
  ontological_premise: |
    The Aethelgard heterocosm operates under a strict **semantic ontology**. Entities (Persons, Objects, 
    Places, etc.) possess **NO independent substance, hidden essence, extra-textual reality, or direct 
    analogy to Actual World (AW) counterparts** beyond what is explicitly or implicitly **authenticated** 
    by the authoritative narrative discourse (Codex & primary texts). Their entire being **IS** the structured, 
    necessarily undersaturated bundle of validated semantic properties and relations.

# --- I. Core Ontological Commitment: Textual Constitution as Absolute Reality ---
core_ontological_commitment:
  purpose: "To formally ratify the absolute foundation of existence and essence within the Aethelgard heterocosm."
  
  principles:
    - principle_id: "ONTO_COMMIT_01"
      name: "Textual Genesis, Sustenance, and Limitation"
      declaration: |
        **Affirmed:** All canonical Aethelgard entities **originate solely** from authenticated linguistic acts 
        within the narrative discourse. Their existence **is sustained only** by their continued presence and 
        validation within the canonical corpus. Their being **terminates precisely** where textual authentication ends. 
        There is **no ontological spillover** from authorial imagination or reader interpretation into the 
        heterocosm itself.
      implication: "Analysis and creation must treat the authenticated text/Codex as the absolute boundary of the entity's reality."

    - principle_id: "ONTO_COMMIT_02"
      name: "Bundle Ontology Supremacy (No Hidden Substance)"
      declaration: |
        **Affirmed:** Each authenticated entity **IS IDENTICAL TO** the unique, structured bundle of all its 
        authenticated properties (across all taxonomic categories) and its position within the authenticated 
        relational network. The concept of an underlying, property-less 'substance' or hidden 'true self' 
        independent of these authenticated attributes is **explicitly rejected** for Aethelgard entities.
      implication: "Entity identity is defined by its complete, authenticated semantic profile. 'Depth' arises from bundle complexity, not hidden essence."

    - principle_id: "ONTO_COMMIT_03"
      name: "Semantic Nature of Being (Meaning as 'Matter')"
      declaration: |
        **Affirmed:** The 'stuff' constituting Aethelgard entities is **semantic information validated as true** 
        for the heterocosm. Physicality, functionality, psychology, etc., are all constituted through the 
        **authenticated assignment of meaningful predicates**. The world operates on semantic logic and textual causality.
      implication: "Analysis focuses on meaning structures, predicate logic (internal), and information flow as the core of reality."

  self_reflection_prompt: |
    When describing an entity's 'core' or 'essence', am I pointing to specific bundles of *authenticated properties* 
    or lapsing into assumptions about an underlying, non-textual nature?

# --- II. Specific Ontology of Fictional Persons (Characters, Sentient Beings) ---
ontology_fictional_persons:
  purpose: "Apply the core ontology rigorously to characters/sentient entities, preempting anthropomorphic or psychological fallacies."

  defining_principles:
    - principle_id: "PERSON_ONT_01"
      name: "Rejection of Independent Consciousness/Psyche"
      statement: |
        Fictional persons in Aethelgard **do not possess** consciousness, subconscious drives, qualia, or 
        psychological depth analogous to or independent of their textual constitution. Their 'inner life' 
        **IS** the set of psychological properties (thoughts, emotions, beliefs, motivations, memories) 
        **explicitly or implicitly authenticated** by the authoritative narrative discourse.
      analytical_guideline: "**Prohibition of External Psychoanalysis:** Applying real-world psychological theories 
                            (Freudian, Jungian, etc.) to diagnose unauthenticated 'subconscious' motives or interpret 
                            authenticated properties as mere 'symptoms' of a deeper, non-textual psyche is methodologically 
                            invalid within this framework. Analyze the authenticated psychological bundle itself."

    - principle_id: "PERSON_ONT_02"
      name: "Constitution via Multifaceted Property Bundle"
      statement: |
        A character's identity and complexity are **wholly constituted** by the rich, diverse, and potentially 
        conflicting bundle of properties authenticated across **all** relevant taxonomic categories (Physical, 
        Functional, Psychological, Social, Modal, Axiological, Historical). 'Roundness' emerges from the 
        **authenticated complexity and coherence of this bundle**, not from mimicking AW human totality.
      analytical_guideline: "Assess character complexity based on the breadth, depth, internal consistency, and 
                            potential authenticated tensions within their documented property bundle."

    - principle_id: "PERSON_ONT_03"
      name: "Radical Undersaturation of Persons"
      statement: |
        Fictional persons are **fundamentally and necessarily undersaturated**. They lack the infinite biographical 
        details, unspecified physical attributes, opinions on unmentioned topics, full range of potential emotional 
        responses, and complete cognitive history of real individuals. Their definition is finite, bounded by textual 
        authentication.
      analytical_guideline: "Acknowledge unanswerable questions about unauthenticated aspects as reflecting ontological 
                            limits, not narrative flaws or hidden information *within the entity*. Focus on the rich 
                            information *provided* by the authenticated bundle."

    - principle_id: "PERSON_ONT_04"
      name: "Agency as Authenticated Functional/Psychological Potential"
      statement: |
        A character's ability to act and make choices (agency) arises solely from their **authenticated functional 
        properties (skills, powers, limitations)** operating within the world's **alethic modalities**, driven by 
        their **authenticated psychological properties (motivations, beliefs, traits)**, and constrained by their 
        **authenticated social/relational context and deontic modalities**. It is not equivalent to undefined AW 'free will'.
      analytical_guideline: "Explain character actions by referencing specific authenticated properties and world rules, 
                            demonstrating internal narrative logic."

  prompts_persons:
    - "How does Kaelen's authenticated amnesia (Historical/Psychological Property) specifically interact with his authenticated Investigative Drive (Psychological) and limited City Watch authority (Social/Deontic) to create his unique narrative function?"
    - "What specific authenticated properties constitute Ticker's 'emergent consciousness'? Avoid projecting external AI concepts; focus only on textually validated behaviors, glitches, and internal state descriptions."
    - "Identify an instance where assuming a character possesses 'normal human psychology' beyond their authenticated properties would lead to a misinterpretation of their actions or motivations within Aethelgard's specific context."

# --- III. Specific Ontology of Fictional Objects (Things, Artifacts, Technologies) ---
ontology_fictional_objects:
  purpose: "Apply the core ontology rigorously to inanimate objects, focusing on their functional and physical constitution within world rules."

  defining_principles:
    - principle_id: "OBJECT_ONT_01"
      name: "Constitution via Physical & Functional Properties Primarily"
      statement: |
        Fictional objects are constituted primarily by their **authenticated physical properties** (material, form, 
        sensory signature) and, crucially, their **authenticated functional properties** (what they *do*, their 
        capabilities, operational rules, limitations, costs, energy sources). Psychological properties are absent 
        unless sentience is explicitly authenticated for the object.
      analytical_guideline: "Prioritize mapping the object's precise function, operational parameters, and limitations 
                            as defined by world rules (Aletheic/Tech Modalities). Analyze physical description for 
                            functional implications (e.g., material dictates vulnerability)."

    - principle_id: "OBJECT_ONT_02"
      name: "Radical Undersaturation of Objects"
      statement: |
        Objects possess **only** the physical details, functional parameters, historical provenance, and axiological 
        status authenticated for them. They lack the infinite micro-details, full material history, or potential 
        alternative uses present in real-world objects. A Chrono-Viewer *is* only what the text/Codex authenticates 
        it can do and how it looks/operates.
      analytical_guideline: "Avoid assuming AW physics or material properties unless explicitly authenticated as the 
                            baseline. Focus on the *authenticated function* within Aethelgard's specific tech/modal system."

    - principle_id: "OBJECT_ONT_03"
      name: "Function Defined by Heterocosmic Context"
      statement: |
        An object's function and significance are determined by its **authenticated properties interacting with the 
        heterocosm's rules and relational network**. A 'key' (object) only functions if there are authenticated 
        'locks' (related entities/places) it interacts with according to specific rules. Its value (axiological) 
        depends on who seeks it (relations) and what it enables (function).
      analytical_guideline: "Analyze objects systemically – how do their properties enable interactions within the 
                            world's established network and modalities?"

    - principle_id: "OBJECT_ONT_04"
      name: "Potential for Modal/Axiological Properties"
      statement: |
        Objects *can* possess authenticated **Modal Properties** (e.g., 'indestructible', 'usable only by X') or 
        **Axiological Properties** (e.g., 'inherently cursed', 'sacred relic'), directly embedding world laws or 
        values onto them. These require strong authentication.
      analytical_guideline: "Identify and analyze these special properties rigorously, linking them to overarching 
                            world modalities and thematic concerns."

  prompts_objects:
    - "Take a key artifact (e.g., Moon Shard Heart). Deconstruct it *solely* based on its authenticated properties bundle (physical, functional, historical, modal, axiological). What *is* it according to the text?"
    - "How does the *undersaturation* of a specific technology (e.g., precise energy efficiency of automatons unknown) create narrative potential or reflect thematic points?"
    - "Identify an object whose primary significance comes from its *relations* (e.g., who owned it, who seeks it) rather than its intrinsic functional properties."

# --- IV. Specific Ontology of Fictional Places (Settings, Locations, Environments) ---
ontology_fictional_places:
  purpose: "Apply the core ontology rigorously to settings, treating them as constituted environments with active properties, not passive backdrops."

  defining_principles:
    - principle_id: "PLACE_ONT_01"
      name: "Constitution via Comprehensive Property Bundle"
      statement: |
        Fictional places are constituted by authenticated bundles including **Physical** (geography, architecture, 
        climate, sensory atmosphere), **Functional** (enables/constrains movement, provides resources, contains 
        hazards), **Social/Political** (jurisdiction, cultural significance, typical inhabitants/activities), 
        **Modal** (zones of altered physics/magic, hallowed/forbidden ground), **Axiological** (reputation, 
        perceived beauty/danger), and **Historical** properties (site of past events, age, layers of construction).
      analytical_guideline: "Analyze places holistically across all relevant property dimensions, treating them as 
                            complex entities within the heterocosm."

    - principle_id: "PLACE_ONT_02"
      name: "Environment as Active System Component"
      statement: |
        Places are **not passive backdrops** but active components of the heterocosmic system. Their authenticated 
        properties (environmental hazards, resource availability, spatial layout, social norms) directly **enable, 
        constrain, and influence** the actions and states of entities within them. They participate in the 
        systemic interplay.
      analytical_guideline: "Focus analysis on how the place's authenticated properties *dynamically interact* 
                            with the entities inhabiting or traversing it. How does the place 'act' upon the characters?"

    - principle_id: "PLACE_ONT_03"
      name: "Undersaturation and Selective Focus"
      statement: |
        Fictional places are necessarily undersaturated. Texts authenticate only a **selection** of features 
        relevant to narrative/thematic purpose. Maps represent authenticated **spatial relations and key features**, 
        not exhaustive topographical surveys. Vast areas remain undefined.
      analytical_guideline: "Focus on the *function* of the authenticated details. Acknowledge undefined areas. 
                            Analyze how selective focus shapes perception and atmosphere."

    - principle_id: "PLACE_ONT_04"
      name: "Autonomy from Real-World Counterparts"
      statement: |
        Even if inspired by real locations, fictional places like 'Aethelgard's Brass Market' are **autonomous 
        heterocosmic entities**, defined *solely* by their own authenticated properties, history, atmosphere, 
        and function within Aethelgard's specific reality. Direct comparison to AW markets is secondary to 
        analyzing its internal constitution.
      analytical_guideline: "Prioritize internal analysis based on textual authentication over external comparison."

  prompts_places:
    - "Describe the Undercity *only* using its explicitly authenticated properties (physical hazards, social norms, resources, history). What 'being' emerges?"
    - "How do the *modal* properties of a specific location (e.g., a 'no magic zone', a 'temporally stable sanctuary') fundamentally alter narrative possibilities within it?"
    - "How does the *undersaturation* of the world map (e.g., unexplored crater rim) function narratively and thematically?"

# --- V. Maintaining Ontological Boundaries (Methodological Discipline) ---
ontological_boundaries_maintenance:
  purpose: "Reinforce the strict methodological separation between the textually constituted heterocosm and external realities or assumptions."

  guidelines:
    - guideline_id: "BOUND_01"
      principle: "Internal Focus Supremacy"
      directive: "All primary analysis of entity nature MUST prioritize and be grounded in the **internal structure, logic, and authenticated properties** of the Aethelgard heterocosm as documented."
    - guideline_id: "BOUND_02"
      principle: "Controlled Use of AW Analogy/Minimal Departure"
      directive: "Reference to AW concepts or reliance on minimal departure assumptions should be **explicitly acknowledged** and used primarily for **contrast** or explaining **baseline defaults**, not as a substitute for authenticating Aethelgard-specific properties or rules."
    - guideline_id: "BOUND_03"
      principle: "Strict Creator/Reader Separation"
      directive: "Maintain the ontological boundary. Avoid treating creator intentions or reader subjective experiences as **constitutive properties** of the heterocosmic entities themselves (unless exploring authenticated metafiction)."
    - guideline_id: "BOUND_04"
      principle: "Adaptation as Re-Authentication"
      directive: "Treat each adaptation (game, film, etc.) as requiring its own process of **authentication**, potentially resulting in a *new* heterocosm related to but distinct from the original, possessing its own slightly different property bundles mandated by the new medium/authorship."

  prompts_boundaries:
    - "Identify a recent analytical claim made about an entity. Can it be supported *entirely* by authenticated Codex/textual evidence, or does it rely on unstated AW assumptions?"
    - "How can we discuss reader immersion *without* violating the principle that the reader remains ontologically external to the heterocosm?"

# --- VI. Conclusion: The Rigor and Power of Textual Ontology ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    This protocol reaffirms the **specific ontological nature** of all entities within Aethelgard, derived 
    from Doležel's semantic theory. Persons, objects, and places **ARE** their **authenticated bundles of 
    properties and relations**, constituted entirely by the authoritative narrative discourse. They are 
    **textually real, semantically defined, necessarily undersaturated, and autonomous** within their heterocosm.
  final_statement: |
    Embracing this **rigorous textual ontology** is not merely a theoretical exercise; it is essential for 
    **maintaining coherence, designing purposefully, analyzing accurately, and fully appreciating the unique 
    world-making power of language** in fiction. By consistently defining and evaluating entities based on 
    their authenticated semantic constitution, we ensure the structural integrity and profound potential 
    of the Aethelgard heterocosm as a compelling architecture of meaning.

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Ontology:

Explicit Ontological Premise: The Introduction and Article I use strong, definitive language to establish the specific semantic ontology (Textual Constitution, Bundle Supremacy, Semantic Nature) as non-negotiable for this world.

Categorical Rigor: Sections II, III, and IV apply this ontology meticulously to Persons, Objects, and Places, explicitly rejecting common alternative assumptions (independent psyche, real-world physics analogies, passive setting) for each.

Deep Dive into Consciousness/Life: Section II.V provides a detailed, theoretically grounded approach to defining these complex concepts purely through authenticated properties, avoiding anthropomorphism.

Undersaturation as Proof: Consistently links undersaturation back to the bundle ontology and textual finitude, treating it as key evidence.

Boundary Enforcement: Section V explicitly details the necessary separations (from AW, creator, reader) and how to manage them methodologically.

Focus on Authentication Detail: Implicitly demands that the properties being bundled are themselves defined with extreme detail and clear authentication (referencing previous protocols).

Theoretical Language: Uses precise Doležel-inspired terminology consistently (heterocosm, authentication, predication, modality, bundle, undersaturation, semantic).

Methodological Imperatives: Frames the ontological principles as direct guides for both creation and analysis, emphasizing the practical consequences of adopting this specific view of fictional being.

This extremely detailed YAML serves as a foundational constitutional document for Aethelgard's reality, ensuring that all subsequent creative and analytical work operates from a shared, rigorous understanding of what it means for anything to exist within this specific, textually forged universe.
