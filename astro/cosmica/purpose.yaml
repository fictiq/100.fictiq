# Keeper of the Codex: [Your Name/Studio Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol guides the **deeply strategic and purposeful design** of the Aethelgard heterocosm, 
    ensuring that creative imagination is rigorously channeled by **overarching narrative and thematic goals**. 
    Inspired by Doležel's framework, it posits that world-building choices (authentication of rules, 
    history, entities, states) are most effective when consciously made to **enable specific stories** 
    and **structurally embody core themes**.
  focus: |
    To meticulously map the functional relationship between every significant world element and the 
    intended narrative experiences and thematic explorations. This involves justifying design choices 
    based on their contribution to purpose, ensuring the world's architecture is not arbitrary but 
    a finely tuned instrument for meaning and story.

# --- I. Defining Core Narrative & Thematic Imperatives ---
core_imperatives:
  purpose: "Articulate the non-negotiable narrative experiences and thematic inquiries that MUST be supported by the world's design."
  
  intended_core_narrative_experiences: # More detailed than just concepts
    - narrative_id: "NARR_InvestigatorArc_Kaelen"
      core_experience: "A Chrono-Noir descent into personal and societal memory corruption, involving investigation of conspiracies, confrontation with unreliable history, navigation of treacherous Guild politics, and culminating in a choice regarding Kaelen's own manufactured/recovered identity."
      key_genres: "[Noir, Mystery, Political Thriller, Psychological Sci-Fi]"
      required_world_support: "[Mechanisms for memory manipulation/loss; controllable information/archives; powerful secretive factions (Guilds); atmosphere of paranoia/decay; core historical mystery.]"

    - narrative_id: "NARR_UndercitySurvival_Rust"
      core_experience: "A visceral struggle for survival and autonomy in the hazardous Undercity, focused on resource management (salvage, Dust), navigation of environmental/temporal dangers (anomalies, Aberrations), tense interactions with rival crews/mutated fauna, and uncovering fragments of lost Artificer tech/history."
      key_genres: "[Survival Horror, Steampunk Adventure, Post-Apocalyptic (localized)]"
      required_world_support: "[Dangerous/unstable Undercity environment; specific resource scarcity; unique creature/Aberration threats; defined salvage mechanics/tech; distinct Undercity social codes.]"

    - narrative_id: "NARR_AutomatonAwakening_Ticker"
      core_experience: "An introspective journey exploring emergent consciousness within an Automaton, grappling with fragmented/implanted memories, challenging its status as property, potentially forming alliances, and questioning the definition of 'life' within Aethelgard's mechanistic worldview."
      key_genres: "[Philosophical Sci-Fi, Character Drama, Potential Thriller (if hunted)]"
      required_world_support: "[Defined Automaton mechanics (memory loops, glitches); clear legal/social status as property; presence of other Automatons for interaction; factions with differing views on AI (Gearwrights vs ?); philosophical underpinning (Clockwork Determinism) to react against.]"
      
    # --- Add other core intended narrative experiences ---

  core_thematic_inquiries: # Phrased as questions the world MUST explore
    - theme_id: "THEME_MemoryIdentity"
      central_question: "When memory is demonstrably unreliable, manipulable, or artificial, what constitutes authentic selfhood, and can identity be rebuilt or chosen?"

      keywords: "[Temporality, Causality, Paradox, Observation, Manipulation, Ethics, Determinism, Flux.]"

    - theme_id: "THEME_BeautyImperfection"
      central_question: "In a world defined by decay and fragmentation, where can true value, beauty, and resilience be found – in striving for lost perfection or embracing functional imperfection and the art of repair?"
      keywords: "[Repair, Resilience, Decay, Wabi-Sabi (concept analogy), Salvage, Endurance, Hope, Found Beauty.]"

    # --- Add/Refine other core thematic inquiries ---

  prompts_imperatives:
    - "For each narrative experience, list the 3-5 *absolutely essential* world features (rules, entities, states) required for it to function."
    - "For each theme, list the 3-5 world structures or dynamics that most *powerfully* explore its central question."
    - "Are there inherent conflicts *between* the needs of different planned narratives or themes? How will the world design balance these?"

# --- II. Aligning Foundational Modalities with Purpose (Deep Justification) ---
modality_alignment_purpose:
  purpose: "Rigorously justify the authentication of *specific* modal rules based on their direct contribution to enabling core narratives and embodying core themes."

  alethic_modality_justification: # Possibility/Necessity
    rule: "[e.g., No True Time Travel (Observation/Stutter Only)]"
    narrative_enablement: "[e.g., Forces investigators (Kaelen) to rely on deduction/witnesses/unreliable tech, driving Noir plot; prevents easy 'reset button' for consequences, raising stakes; makes historical mysteries harder to solve.]"
    thematic_embodiment: "[e.g., Enforces Legacy & Consequence (past is fixed); defines Nature of Time as fundamentally linear despite local flux; limits hubristic attempts at total control (Order vs Chaos).]"
    alternative_considered_rejected: "[e.g., Allowing limited time travel was considered but rejected as it undermined core themes of consequence and the mystery of the past.]"

    rule: "[e.g., Paradox Risk Escalates Exponentially]"
    narrative_enablement: "[e.g., Creates inherent suspense/danger whenever Chrono-Tech is pushed; allows for spectacular failure/disaster scenes; provides mechanism for Aberration appearances.]"
    thematic_embodiment: "[e.g., Physicalizes the danger of tampering (Nature of Time); represents Chaos erupting from attempts at excessive Order; consequence for hubris (Legacy).]"
    alternative_considered_rejected: "[e.g., Predictable/linear risk was rejected as less dramatic and less reflective of chaotic temporal theme.]"

    # --- Justify other key alethic rules ---

  deontic_modality_justification: # Obligation/Permission
    rule: "[e.g., Guild Secrecy Laws & Memory Wipe Penalty]"
    narrative_enablement: "[e.g., Creates major obstacles/threats for protagonists seeking Guild secrets; motivates covert actions/espionage; allows antagonists immense power through information control.]"
    thematic_embodiment: "[e.g., Represents extreme form of Order/Control; directly conflicts with quest for truth (Memory/Identity); explores ethics of knowledge suppression.]"
    alternative_considered_rejected: "[e.g., Lesser penalties rejected as insufficient to create necessary stakes/atmosphere of paranoia.]"

    rule: "[e.g., Conflicting Guild vs. Undercity Codes]"
    narrative_enablement: "[e.g., Generates inherent conflict for characters operating between worlds (Kaelen, Rust); allows for complex moral choices and betrayals based on differing loyalties.]"
    thematic_embodiment: "[e.g., Structurally embodies Order vs. Chaos (formal law vs. survival code); explores cultural relativism/clash of values.]"
    alternative_considered_rejected: "[e.g., A single unified legal system was rejected as less dynamic and less reflective of the world's fractured state.]"

    # --- Justify other key deontic rules ---

  axiological_modality_justification: # Values
    value_system: "[e.g., Strong valuation of 'Functional Repair' vs. 'Disposable Newness']"
    narrative_enablement: "[e.g., Explains prevalence of patched-up tech/clothing; motivates characters skilled in repair; creates conflict with factions pushing for mass-produced (potentially flawed) new tech.]"
    thematic_embodiment: "[e.g., Directly embodies Beauty in Imperfection/Resilience; contrasts with potentially hollow pursuit of 'lost perfection' or unsustainable Progress.]"
    alternative_considered_rejected: "[e.g., Standard consumerist value system rejected as less unique and thematically resonant for Aethelgard.]"

    # --- Justify other key axiological authentications ---

  epistemic_modality_justification: # Knowledge/Belief
    rule: "[e.g., Historical Records Proven Unreliable/Manipulated]"
    narrative_enablement: "[e.g., Central engine for mystery/investigation plots; forces reliance on primary sources/deduction; allows for major historical reveals/twists.]"
    thematic_embodiment: "[e.g., Directly explores Memory & Identity (collective), Truth vs. Secrecy, Legacy (difficulty of knowing past); critiques power structures controlling information.]"
    alternative_considered_rejected: "[e.g., Fully accessible, reliable history rejected as it would remove core mysteries and thematic explorations.]"

    # --- Justify other key epistemic rules ---

  prompts_modality_purpose:
    - "For each core rule, articulate *precisely* which intended narrative experiences it makes possible or more compelling."
    - "For each core rule, explain *exactly* how it functions to embody or generate inquiry into specific core themes."
    - "Could any rule be altered to *better* serve narrative/thematic goals without sacrificing coherence?"

# --- III. Aligning Authenticated History with Purpose (Deep Dive) ---
history_alignment_purpose:
  purpose: "Ensure the *specific details and structure* of the constructed past provide necessary context, motivation, conflict generators, and thematic grounding for the intended narratives and themes."

  historical_element_analysis:
    - element: "The Shattering (Specific *Nature* remains Mystery)"
      narrative_function_served: "[e.g., Provides the ultimate 'original sin'/trauma driving world state; its *mystery* fuels investigation plots; its *consequences* (Dust, Aberrations) provide ongoing environmental conflict/horror.]"
      thematic_function_served: "[e.g., Embodies *Legacy & Consequence* on grand scale; source of *Chaos* disrupting previous *Order*; questions *Nature of Time/Causality*.]"
      design_justification: "Central mystery essential for Noir investigation & exploring unknown past (Memory/Legacy). Consequences provide core world mechanics/hazards needed for survival/adventure narratives."

    - element: "Artificer Era (Authenticated as 'Lost Golden Age' in *some* legends, highly advanced but specifics unknown)"
      narrative_function_served: "[e.g., Source of powerful/dangerous MacGuffins (lost tech); provides goal for exploration/discovery quests; explains presence of anomalous ruins; potential source of cryptic clues.]"
      thematic_function_served: "[e.g., Explores *Legacy* (lost potential); fuels *Progress vs. Preservation* debate; its 'lost' nature reinforces *Epistemic* limits and contested *Memory*.]"
      design_justification: "Ambiguity is key – provides sense of wonder/mystery without requiring exhaustive definition of 'perfect' past. Focus is on its *impact* as a lost ideal/dangerous legacy."

    - element: "Detailed History of Inter-Guild Skirmishes (Authenticated)"
      narrative_function_served: "[e.g., Provides specific reasons for current factional mistrust/alliances; creates character backstories involving past conflicts; offers precedents for current political maneuvering.]"
      thematic_function_served: "[e.g., Demonstrates *cyclical conflict* (Legacy); explores *consequences* of specific power grabs; shows practical application of *Order vs. Chaos* within political system.]"
      design_justification: "Adds granularity and believable friction to Guild Politics system, grounding current tensions in specific, authenticated past events rather than generic rivalry."

    # --- Analyze other key historical elements for purpose ---

  prompts_history_purpose:
    - "How does the *specific sequence* of authenticated historical events create the necessary preconditions for your core narrative conflicts?"
    *   - "How does the *way history is remembered or forgotten* (authenticated epistemic state regarding history) serve your themes (e.g., unreliable memory, political manipulation)?"
    *   - "Are there historical 'blank spots' that are strategically positioned to allow for specific character backstories or future narrative reveals?"
    *   - "Does the *sensory legacy* of history directly contribute to the intended narrative atmosphere or thematic exploration?"

# --- IV. Aligning Global States with Purpose (Deep Dive) ---
global_states_alignment_purpose:
  purpose: "Ensure the authenticated 'Now' conditions provide the optimal context, atmosphere, challenges, and opportunities necessary for the intended narratives and themes to flourish."

  global_state_analysis:
    - state: "[e.g., Pervasive Surveillance & Information Control (Political/Epistemic)]"
      narrative_function_served: "[e.g., *Essential* for Noir investigation/conspiracy plots; creates high stakes for protagonists; necessitates stealth/covert communication mechanics; empowers antagonists controlling information flow.]"
      thematic_function_served: "[e.g., *Directly embodies* themes of Order vs. Chaos/Freedom, Truth vs. Secrecy, Power dynamics related to knowledge.]"
      design_justification: "Core element required to create the specific challenges and atmosphere needed for the 'Chrono-Noir' experience."

    - state: "[e.g., High Temporal Instability / Frequent Aberration Appearances (Environmental/Alethic)]"
      narrative_function_served: "[e.g., Provides constant source of external threat/horror; creates unique environmental puzzles/hazards; justifies specialized skills/tech (Anomaly detectors, containment); drives survival narratives.]"
      thematic_function_served: "[e.g., *Physical manifestation* of world's brokenness (Legacy), inherent Chaos challenging Order, fragility of reality (Nature of Time).]"
      design_justification: "Necessary to make the 'temporal fallout' a tangible, ever-present factor impacting all levels of society and narrative."

    - state: "[e.g., Stark Economic Inequality & Guild Resource Hoarding (Economic/Social)]"
      narrative_function_served: "[e.g., *Drives motivations* for large parts of population (survival, crime, rebellion); fuels Guild conflict (resource wars); creates distinct social environments (opulent Guild halls vs. desperate Undercity); provides opportunities for social commentary plots.]"
      thematic_function_served: "[e.g., Explores *consequences* of power/control; highlights *social stratification* aspect of Order vs. Chaos; provides context for themes of *Resilience* vs. Desperation.]"
      design_justification: "Needed to create believable motivations for non-elite characters and ground political struggles in tangible resource conflicts."

    # --- Analyze other key global states for purpose ---

  prompts_global_states_purpose:
    - "Imagine your core narrative concept. Now imagine changing one key global state drastically (e.g., making resources abundant instead of scarce). How fundamentally would the narrative have to change? Does this confirm the state's necessity?"
    *   - "How does the *sensory reality* created by the global states (e.g., oppressive atmosphere, polluted environment) directly serve the intended genre feel and thematic concerns?"
    *   - "Are there any global states authenticated that *don't* seem to strongly support either the core narratives or themes? Could they be cut or modified for greater purpose?"

# --- V. Aligning Entity Design with Purpose (Deep Dive) ---
entity_design_alignment_purpose:
  purpose: "Ensure key entities are authenticated with properties and relations specifically designed to fulfill crucial narrative roles and embody thematic concerns within the established world system."

  entity_analysis:
    - entity_id: "[e.g., CHAR_Kaelen_01]"
      narrative_role_served: "[e.g., Protagonist, Investigator, Audience viewpoint for mystery/world discovery.]"
      thematic_role_served: "[e.g., Embodiment of Memory/Identity crisis, pawn/challenger navigating Order/Chaos.]"
      key_properties_justification:
        - property: "Amnesia" 
          justification: "Drives personal mystery (Narrative); Directly embodies core theme (Thematic)."
        - property: "Observational Skills" 
          justification: "Enables investigation gameplay/plot progression (Narrative); Highlights theme of seeking truth in details (Thematic)."
        - property: "Outsider Status (initially)" 
          justification: "Allows critique of Guilds, facilitates alliances with Undercity (Narrative); Represents alienation/search for belonging (Thematic)."
      design_check: "Are Kaelen's *limitations* (amnesia, lack of connections) as important for his narrative/thematic function as his skills?"

    - entity_id: "[e.g., FACTION_MemoryKeepers]"
      narrative_role_served: "[e.g., Information gatekeepers, potential antagonists/allies, source of conflict/exposition regarding history.]"
      thematic_role_served: "[e.g., Embodiment of controlled/unreliable Memory, institutional Order/Secrecy, potential manipulation of Identity/Legacy.]"
      key_properties_justification:
        - property: "Control over Archives" 
          justification: "Creates core obstacle/goal for investigation plots (Narrative); Represents power via information (Thematic)."
        - property: "Reputation for Secrecy/Manipulation" 
          justification: "Generates mistrust/intrigue (Narrative); Embodies epistemic uncertainty/control themes (Thematic)."
        - property: "Unique Memory Tech (Flawed)" 
          justification: "Provides unique plot devices/solutions/dangers (Narrative); Explores ethics/limits of tech related to core themes (Thematic)."
      design_check: "Is their power level and sphere of influence clearly defined and consistent with their role and the overall political balance?"

    # --- Analyze other key entities for narrative/thematic purpose ---

  prompts_entity_purpose:
    - "For each key character, faction, or creature, articulate its *primary necessary function* within your intended narratives."
    *   - "How do its specific authenticated *properties* (especially unique or limiting ones) directly enable it to fulfill that narrative function?"
    *   - "How does this entity, through its nature or actions, serve as a focal point or embodiment of one or more core *themes*?"
    *   - "Could a different entity design serve these functions *better* within the Aethelgard context?"

# --- VI. Conclusion: Purpose as the Architect's Guide ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    This deep dive confirms that within the Doležel-inspired framework, **imagination in world-building is most potent when guided by purpose**. The strategic selection and authentication of every element – from fundamental modalities and sweeping historical arcs to prevailing global conditions and specific entity properties – should ideally serve clearly defined **narrative imperatives** and **thematic inquiries**.
  final_statement: |
    The Aethelgard heterocosm is architected not as an arbitrary collection of ideas, but as a **purpose-built semantic system**. Its rules are designed to generate specific conflicts and possibilities. Its history is constructed to provide meaningful context and legacy. Its present state creates the necessary pressures and atmosphere. Its inhabitants are constituted to embody its themes and drive its intended narratives. By ensuring this deep alignment between **structure and purpose**, the world moves beyond mere imaginative novelty to become a **resonant engine of meaning and story**, fulfilling the ultimate potential of the fictional heterocosm. The 'why' behind each authenticated detail is as crucial as the 'what'.

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Purposeful Design:

Imperatives, Not Just Goals: Section I asks for "Core Narrative & Thematic Imperatives," framing these as non-negotiable requirements the world must support.

Deep Justification: Section II demands detailed justification for why specific modal rules were chosen, linking them explicitly to both narrative enablement and thematic embodiment, and even asking for considered alternatives.

Narrative/Thematic Function Focus: Sections III, IV, and V consistently require analysis of both the narrative function and the thematic function served by authenticated history, states, and entities, demanding a dual focus.

Specificity Required: Examples and prompts push for highly specific connections (e.g., linking specific sensory details of history to present themes, analyzing precise mechanics enabling plot).

Systemic Purpose: It emphasizes how the purpose guides the construction of the entire system, including the interplay between its parts.

Rigorous Self-Questioning: The prompts throughout are designed to force deep reflection on the necessity and effectiveness of each design choice relative to the overarching goals. ("Why this rule?" "Does it truly serve the theme?" "Could another design work better?")

Concluding Affirmation of Intent: The conclusion strongly reaffirms the principle of intentional, purpose-driven design as the key to creating a powerful heterocosm.

This extremely detailed YAML template encourages an almost forensic level of intentionality in your world-building, ensuring every authenticated element of Aethelgard is pulling its weight in service of the stories you want to tell and the ideas you aim to explore.
