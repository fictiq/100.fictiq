**Important Notes:**

*   **Fandom vs. Independent Wikis:** Many of these wikis are hosted on Fandom (formerly Wikia). While Fandom provides a platform, it also has its drawbacks (ads, occasional editorial issues). Some wikis are independently hosted and may have stricter quality control.
*   **Page Count is Not Everything:** A higher page count doesn't necessarily mean a better wiki. The quality of the information, the accuracy of the data, and the activity of the community are all important factors.
*   **Constantly Changing:** These numbers are approximate and change constantly as the games are updated and the wikis are expanded.



These wikis represent some of the most dedicated and comprehensive resources available for video game information. They are invaluable tools for players, researchers, and anyone interested in learning more about their favorite games.
