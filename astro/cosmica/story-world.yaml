# ============================================================

world_name: Aethelgard

# --- 1. World Identity: The Unmistakable Essence ---
# (Serves World-First: Defines the core feeling and purpose)
core_concept: A "Chrono-Noir" universe blending steampunk mechanics with unstable temporal fallout beneath a Shattered Moon, exploring memory, identity, and order versus chaos.
logline: In a clockwork city haunted by temporal dust and forgotten histories, uncovering conspiracies means risking reality itself.
primary_themes: # The philosophical DNA driving stories & engagement
  - Memory & Identity (What makes 'you' when time/memory is broken?)
  - Order vs. Chaos (Mechanical precision vs. Temporal instability/Human nature)
  - Legacy & Consequence (The weight of the past, the price of the future)
  - Nature of Time (Its mutability, paradoxes, ethical manipulation)
dominant_tone: Steampunk Noir (Atmospheric, Intrigue-laden, Melancholy) with undertones of Hopeful Decay (Resilience, Found Beauty).

# --- 2. Core Mythology: The Non-Negotiable Rules & Realities ---
# (Serves Mythology is Key: Ensures consistency and believable stakes)
mythology:
  foundational_reality:
    the_shattering: The defining cataclysm. Broke the moon 'Aethel' into 'Aethel Umbra', fundamentally destabilizing local time via 'Chrono-Dust'. *Cause and precise nature are a core, open mystery.*
    nature_of_time: Not strictly linear; locally mutable via Chrono-Tech but prone to paradox and 'Lost Seconds'. Large-scale alterations are disastrous/mythical. Causality generally resists major retroactive changes.
  
  governing_system_chrono_tech: # The unique 'science' - Principles & Limitations are KEY.
    source: Refined Chrono-Dust from Aethel Umbra.
    core_principle: Allows localized temporal manipulation (stasis, slow/fast, observation) and rudimentary 'memory' imprinting via intricate clockwork mechanisms. *It is NOT magic.*
    critical_limitations: # Non-negotiable for consistency & stakes.
      - Paradox Risk: Significant manipulations court temporal instability, attract 'Aberrations', or cause localized reality failure.
      - Imprecision & Decay: Chrono-Tech effects flicker, degrade; memories corrupt; 'Lost Seconds' accumulate. Perfection is impossible/legendary.
      - Energy & Resource Cost: Requires refined Dust (Guild controlled) and significant power; not casually employed.
      - Temporal Sickness: Overexposure to Dust/Fields causes physical and mental degradation (memory loss, phasing).

  foundational_history_lore: # The essential backstory and mysteries.
    key_eras: Mythic Age (Pre-Shattering, Lost); The Shattering (Cataclysm); Age of Reconstruction (Current).
    defining_event: The Shattering (Year Zero). Its legacy permeates everything.
    core_mysteries_driving_engagement: # Explicitly designed hooks for exploration & speculation.
      - Origin/Cause of The Shattering.
      - True nature/fate of the 'Great Artificers'.
      - Origin and nature of 'Temporal Aberrations'.
      - What lies in the deepest Undercity / Lost Sectors?
      - The full truth behind Memory Keeper practices & historical records.

  foundational_conflicts_story_engines: # Inherent tensions providing renewable plot fuel.
    - Guild Rivalries (Control of Dust, Tech, Information).
    - Order (City/Guilds) vs. Chaos (Undercity, Anomalies, Human Nature).
    - Truth vs. Secrecy/Manipulation (Investigation vs. Control).
    - Progress vs. Preservation/Risk (Innovation vs. Stability/Ethics).
    - Humanity vs. Mechanization/Automation (Consciousness, Identity).

# --- 3. Key World Elements: The Essential Pillars ---
# (Defines the iconic setting, inhabitants, and unique resources)
key_elements:
  primary_setting: Aethelgard City (Massive clockwork city in a crater beneath Aethel Umbra). Verticality and concentric rings are key structural concepts.
  iconic_zones: # Representing core conflicts/themes.
    - The Orrery District/Council Spire (Ordered Control).
    - The Gearwright Quarter/Steamworks (Industrial Might/Labor).
    - The Memory Keepers Archive (Information Control/Secrecy).
    - The Brass Market (Chaotic Interaction/Commerce).
    - The Rusting Undercity (Danger, Mystery, Forgotten Past, Freedom).
  sentient_inhabitants:
    - Humans: Dominant population, organized primarily by Guilds or Unguilded status. Subject to temporal sickness.
    - Automatons: Clockwork constructs animated by Chrono-Tech memory loops. Status ranges from tools to potentially emergent consciousness. Prone to glitches/decay. *Their nature is a key thematic exploration.*
  key_factions_archetypes: # Essential players in the power dynamic.
    - The Cogwork Council (Nominal Rulers).
    - Major Guilds (Chronometers, Gearwrights, Memory Keepers - True Power Brokers).
    - Undercity Salvagers/Communities (Outside the System).
    - Aethelgard City Watch (Enforcers of Surface Order).
    - Character Archetypes: Investigator (often memory-affected), Guild Agent (loyal/conflicted), Salvager (resourceful/cynical), Automaton (questioning/glitched), Keeper of Secrets.
  core_resource_hazard:
    - Chrono-Dust: The essential fuel and source of instability. Harvesting/Refining is key.
    - Temporal Aberrations: The primary monstrous threat, born from temporal instability. Unpredictable, dangerous.

# --- 4. Design Philosophy for Expansion & Engagement ---
# (Serves Designed for Expansion & Audience Engagement: Guiding future creation)
design_philosophy:
  expandability_focus: Prioritize exploring the Core Mysteries, Foundational Conflicts, and Undefined Zones (Undercity, Outer Rings, Moon Fragments). Encourage diverse genres within the Chrono-Noir framework.
  engagement_hooks: Leverage Strategic Ambiguity (Mysteries, Origins), opportunities for Clue Seeding (inherent complexity of Chrono-Tech, fragmented history), and potential for Transmedia exploration (distinct zones/facets suit different media). Consistency is paramount for rewarding investment.
  creative_freedom_principle: This Codex defines the immutable laws and core concepts. Specific applications of Chrono-Tech, minor historical details, individual character stories, detailed cultural practices, and specific plotlines are open for creative development, *provided they adhere to these foundational elements.*

# --- 5. Canon Management: Maintaining Trust ---
# (Serves World Bible Function: Ensures consistency for Temporal Investment)
canon_management:
  core_principle: Consistency is essential for audience trust and meaningful engagement. This Codex is the ultimate authority on foundational elements.
  canon_tiers_simple:
    - Core Canon: Primary narrative releases (flagship series/game/novel line). Defines major events/character arcs.
    - Expansive Canon: Officially licensed tie-ins. Must align with Core Canon; contradictions are superseded. Enriches world.
    - Non-Canon: Fan works, TTRPG campaigns (unless officially integrated later).
  bible_maintenance: Keeper of the Codex responsible for updates reflecting new Core/Expansive Canon, ensuring consistency. Core rules/concepts are intended to be stable.

Why this Distilled Version Maximizes Creative Expression Wisely:

Focus on Immutable Laws: It locks down the absolute core physics, the nature of time, the source/limits of Chrono-Tech, and the defining historical event. These provide the consistent sandbox rules.

Highlights Generative Concepts: It emphasizes the core mysteries and foundational conflicts as explicit engines designed to spark story ideas.

Defines Archetypes, Not Characters: Provides templates and key factions, leaving specific character creation wide open within those roles.

Establishes Zones, Not Every Street: Defines the essential macro-locations and their thematic purpose, allowing creators to populate them with specific details.

Prioritizes Principles Over Lists: Instead of listing every possible gadget, it defines the principles and critical limitations of Chrono-Tech, empowering creators to invent new applications within those rules.

Explicitly Protects Mystery: Designates key areas as intentionally ambiguous, giving permission not to explain everything and encouraging stories that explore, rather than simply reveal.

Clear but Flexible Canon: Establishes a hierarchy without being overly prescriptive about future media, allowing strategic flexibility.

Empowering Philosophy: The introductory and concluding sections frame the document itself as a tool designed to enable creativity by providing a solid, inspiring foundation.

As the artist using this, you have the essential boundaries, the core thematic concerns, the primary conflicts, and the key mysteries. You know how this world works fundamentally, why it feels the way it does, and where the big questions lie. The rest – the specific people, the intricate plots, the detailed descriptions, the nuanced cultural expressions – is your canvas. This structure ensures your creations feel authentically Aethelgard while giving you vast territory to explore and invent.
