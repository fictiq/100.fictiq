# Story World Codex: Axiological Framework Protocol
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.F (Assigning World-Internal Value)

**World:** [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]
**Codex Version:** [e.g., 0.1 - Value Systems]
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

## Introduction: Authenticating the World's Value System

*This protocol guides the definition of the **axiological framework** of the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Following Doležel, values (good/bad, beautiful/ugly, desirable/undesirable, honorable/dishonorable, sacred/profane) are not universal assumptions but **properties constituted and authenticated** by the authoritative narrative discourse *within* the specific world.*

*Use this document to explicitly define the core value judgments that operate within your world. Focus on **authentication**: establish how these values are made 'true' for the heterocosm (via narration, consistent consequences, reliable character consensus, cultural norms). Distinguish internal world-values from external author/reader values.*

## II. Assigning Authenticated Axiological Properties to Entities

*Purpose: To explicitly define the value status of key entities (persons, objects, places, concepts, actions) *within the world's authenticated value system(s)*.*

*   **Entity ID:** `[e.g., CHAR_Kaelen_01]`
    *   **Axiological Property:** `[e.g., Moral Standing (Contested): Seen as 'Dangerous Loose Cannon' by Guilds; Seen as 'Potentially Useful / Honorable Fool' by some Undercity elements; Narrative framing suggests inherent drive for 'Truth' as positive.]`
        *   *Authentication:* `[Dialogue reflecting perceptions, Narrator focus on truth-seeking drive.]`
    *   **Axiological Property:** `[e.g., Aesthetic Value: Appearance considered 'Unremarkable' / 'Worn' by Surface standards.]`
        *   *Authentication:* `[Narrative description, lack of commentary on appearance by status-conscious characters.]`

*   **Entity ID:** `[e.g., OBJ_ArtificerHeart]`
    *   **Axiological Property:** `[e.g., Inherent Value Status: Authenticated as 'Sacred' / 'Fundamentally aligned with Order'; Repels Chaos (Aberrations).]` (Connects to Modal Property MODAL-AXI-HEART-SACRED)
        *   *Authentication:* `[Requires high narrative authority - ancient texts, consistent demonstration of effects.]`
    *   **Axiological Property:** `[e.g., Perceived Worth: Considered 'Priceless' artifact by all factions, but for different reasons (power vs. understanding vs. control).]`
        *   *Authentication:* `[Character actions/motivations related to acquiring it.]`

*   **Entity ID:** `[e.g., ACTION_MemoryWipe]`
    *   **Axiological Property:** `[e.g., Moral Standing: Authenticated by Guilds/Council as 'Necessary Tool for Order/Security'; Authenticated by narrative/protagonist perspective as 'Ethical Abomination' / 'Violation of Identity'.]` (Explicitly authenticating conflicting value judgments)
        *   *Authentication:* `[Guild justifications vs. Protagonist internal monologue/narrative framing of negative consequences.]`
    *   **Axiological Property:** `[e.g., Social Value: Authenticated as 'Effective Deterrent' by authorities; Authenticated as 'Source of Fear/Mistrust' by populace.]`
        *   *Authentication:* `[Depiction of its use vs. depiction of public reaction.]`

*   **Entity ID:** `[e.g., PLACE_Undercity_DeepRuins]`
    *   **Axiological Property:** `[e.g., Perceived Worth: 'Valuable Source of Salvage' (Economic Value) vs. 'Dangerous, Forbidden Zone' (Social/Legal Disvalue) vs. 'Repository of True History' (Epistemic/Potential Axiological Value for some).]`
        *   *Authentication:* `[Contrasting character motivations/actions regarding the ruins.]`
    *   **Axiological Property:** `[e.g., Aesthetic Value: Considered 'Grotesque and Decaying' by Surface aesthetics; Possesses a 'Sublime Terror' or 'Haunting Beauty' for explorers/artists focused on resilience/past.]`
        *   *Authentication:* `[Contrasting descriptive language used by narrator or different characters.]`

*   **(Assign key axiological properties to other significant entities, actions, concepts)**

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *How is this entity generally judged according to the dominant value system(s) of Aethelgard?*
    *   *Does it possess an *inherent* moral or aesthetic quality authenticated by the highest narrative authority, or is its value purely based on perception/utility within the world?*
    *   *Are there *conflicting* value judgments applied to this entity by different authenticated groups or perspectives?*
    *   *How does its axiological status influence how other entities interact with it?*

## III. Narrative & Thematic Function of Axiological Structure

*Purpose: Analyze how the world's authenticated value system drives narrative and explores core themes.*

*   **Driving Motivation:**
    *   *Analysis:* How does the pursuit of authenticated 'goods' (e.g., Order, Knowledge, Survival, Wealth, Justice-as-defined-here) or the avoidance of authenticated 'bads' (e.g., Chaos, Paradox, Dishonor, Poverty) motivate key characters and factions?
    *   *Examples:* `[e.g., Guild Masters motivated by authenticated value of Control/Order; Kaelen motivated by value of Truth; Salvagers motivated by value of Survival/Resourcefulness.]`

*   **Generating Conflict:**
    *   *Analysis:* How do conflicts arise from clashes between authenticated value systems (e.g., Guild Order vs. Undercity Freedom), or from characters challenging the dominant axiology? How do conflicts arise from competition for entities authenticated as highly valuable?
    *   *Examples:* `[e.g., Kaelen's pursuit of truth clashes with Guild value of secrecy/control; Competition for the Moon Shard Heart drives inter-factional conflict; Ethical dilemmas arise when survival necessitates violating a deeply held (authenticated) value.]`

*   **Guiding Audience Alignment/Sympathy:**
    *   *Analysis:* How does the narrative discourse, through its authentication of values (often via narrator tone, consequences, framing), guide the audience to sympathize with certain characters or viewpoints, even if those values differ from AW norms? Is alignment straightforward or deliberately complicated?
    *   *Examples:* `[e.g., Narrative consistently frames Memory Keepers' actions negatively, aligning audience against their value of controlled history. Sympathy generated for Undercity resilience despite their breaking of Surface laws, validating their value system contextually.]`

*   **Exploring Core Themes:**
    *   *Analysis:* How does the specific axiological framework directly explore core themes?
    *   *Examples:* `[e.g., Conflicting values around technology directly explore Progress vs. Preservation. Taboos around historical truth explore Memory/Identity. Differing definitions of 'Order' explore Order vs. Chaos. Valuing repair explores Beauty in Imperfection.]`

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *What are the primary conflicts generated purely by the clash of authenticated values in this world?*
    *   *How does the world's value system force characters to make difficult, thematically resonant choices?*
    *   *How is the audience positioned, via authentication of values, to judge the world and its inhabitants?*

---

## IV. Consistency Check for Axiology

*Purpose: Ensure the authenticated value system is applied consistently.*

*   **Check Point 1: Narrator/Discourse Consistency:** Does the authoritative narrative voice consistently frame actions and entities according to the established axiology? Or does it send mixed signals without justification?
    *   `Assessment:` `[e.g., Generally consistent. Narrator subtly reinforces negative consequences of hubris/chaos.]`
*   **Check Point 2: Consequence Consistency:** Do actions aligned with positive world-values generally lead to positive outcomes (within world logic), and actions aligned with negative values lead to negative outcomes, *unless* the theme involves exploring injustice or the failure of the value system itself?
    *   `Assessment:` `[e.g., Need to ensure 'bad guys' don't always prosper without *any* form of authenticated consequence (internal or external) consistent with world axiology.]`
*   **Check Point 3: Character Alignment Consistency:** Do characters generally act in accordance with the values authenticated for their faction/culture/personality, or do deviations feel unmotivated or contradictory to their established profile?
    *   `Assessment:` `[e.g., Guild members consistently prioritize order/control. Kaelen's occasional altruism needs careful framing against his cynicism.]`

*   **# Prompt:** *Where might an external (reader's) value system conflict with the world's internal axiology? How does the text manage this potential friction – does it challenge the reader, reinforce the internal logic, or create thematic tension?*

## Conclusion: The Moral & Aesthetic Compass of the Heterocosm

*This protocol emphasizes the critical role of **authenticated axiological properties** in shaping the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. By deliberately legislating what is considered good, bad, beautiful, ugly, valuable, or taboo *within the world itself*, the creator establishes the **moral and aesthetic compass** guiding inhabitants and informing narrative meaning.*

*A well-defined, consistently applied axiological framework, built through authoritative predication, is essential for driving character motivation, generating value-based conflict, exploring themes deeply, and orienting the audience within the unique ethical and aesthetic landscape of this fictional reality. It ensures the world possesses not just physical form and functional rules, but also a defined system of **worth and significance**.*

**How This Markdown Document Guides Axiological Design:**

1.  **Focus on World-Internal Values:** Constantly emphasizes defining values *as authenticated within the heterocosm*, distinct from external norms.
2.  **Structured Categorization:** Breaks down axiology into moral, aesthetic, utilitarian, social/reputational, and affective dimensions (drawing from the property taxonomy).
3.  **Requires Authentication Examples:** Demands justification for *how* values are established (narration, consequences, consensus, symbolism).
4.  **Links Value to Entities/Actions:** Includes section for assigning specific axiological properties to key entities, concepts, or even actions.
5.  **Connects Axiology to Narrative/Theme:** Explicitly requires analysis of how the value system drives motivation, conflict, audience alignment, and thematic exploration.
6.  **Consistency Check:** Includes specific checks for ensuring the authenticated value system is applied consistently.
7.  **Promotes Nuance:** Encourages consideration of conflicting value systems within the world and the distinction between objective world-values and subjective character perceptions.

By using this protocol, you can ensure that the value system of Aethelgard is not just an afterthought, but a deliberately constructed, integral part of its architecture, contributing significantly to its depth, coherence, and thematic power.
