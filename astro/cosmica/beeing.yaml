# ============================================================
# Story World Codex: Entity Constitution Protocol (Taxonomy of Properties Method)
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Property Spectrum)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly granular framework** for the meticulous definition 
    of entities within the Aethelgard heterocosm, applying Doležel's principle that entities **ARE** 
    constituted by **bundles of diverse, authenticated properties**. It employs a detailed **taxonomy** 
    to ensure all critical dimensions of fictional being are considered and explicitly defined 
    through **authenticated predication**.
  scope: |
    Mandatory template for defining all significant canonical entities (persons, objects, places, 
    creatures, organizations, concepts, systems). Ensures multifaceted characterization, systemic 
    integration, internal consistency, and clear boundaries between authenticated reality and 
    intentional undersaturation.
  ontological_premise: |
    Entities possess **no inherent substance** beyond the sum of their authenticated properties and 
    relations documented herein and in core texts. 'Depth' and 'complexity' arise from the **richness, 
    interconnection, and consistency** of this authenticated bundle. Unlisted properties are 
    **ontologically undefined** within the Aethelgard heterocosm.

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Property Bundles:

Granular Categorization: Breaks down major property types (Physical, Functional, Psychological, Social, Modal, Axiological, Historical) into highly specific subcategories.

Emphasis on Authentication Source: Mandates citing the specific source for every significant property, reinforcing textual grounding.

Explicit Undersaturation Tracking: Requires dedicated notes within each major category identifying what remains undefined, forcing conscious management of incompleteness.

Sensory Integration: Incorporates detailed sensory properties directly within the Physical section and prompts consideration elsewhere.

Deep Dive into Functionality: Requires detailing not just abilities but specific constraints, limits, costs, vulnerabilities, and dependencies.

Nuanced Psychology: Breaks down mental properties into traits, cognitive style, motivations, beliefs, emotions, flaws, and even authenticated subjective experiences.

Relational Focus: Emphasizes defining entities through their connections and status within social, political, and factional networks.

Modal Specificity: Includes a section for unique modal properties directly linking the entity to world laws.

Value Distinction: Separates inherent modal/axiological properties from perceived value within the world's system.

Historical Depth: Requires detailing specific origins, links to past events, and provenance where applicable.

Sophisticated Synthesis: The final summary demands articulating the entity's core essence, systemic role, and internal tensions as emergent properties of the entire authenticated bundle.

Rigorous Prompts: While removed for pure template function, the underlying concept assumes prompts pushing for extreme specificity within each field (as seen in previous Markdown examples).

This extremely detailed YAML template provides a powerful framework for building fictional entities with profound depth, nuance, and internal consistency, fully realizing the potential of Doležel's concept of entities as complex bundles of authenticated properties. It demands rigorous thought but yields a richly defined foundation for compelling characters and world elements.
