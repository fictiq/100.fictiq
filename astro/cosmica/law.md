Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template designed to help you consciously define and track **Modal Properties** for key entities within your story world. This protocol is based on the principles discussed in **"E. Modal Properties: Embedding World Laws onto Entities"** from Doležel's *Heterocosmica*.

The purpose is to help you strategically assign properties that define an entity's unique relationship to the fundamental rules (modalities) of your heterocosm, ensuring these exceptional traits are clearly authenticated and function consistently within the world's logic.

## Introduction: Defining Exceptional Status via Authenticated Modality

*This protocol guides the definition of **Modal Properties** for entities within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Following Doležel, these are specific, authenticated attributes that directly define an entity's inherent status concerning the world's governing laws of **possibility, necessity, impossibility (Alethic), obligation, permission, prohibition (Deontic), inherent value (Axiological), or knowledge state (Epistemic)**.*

*These properties often mark entities as unique, powerful, limited, or fated exceptions to general rules. Defining them clearly and ensuring their consistent application is crucial for world coherence, narrative stakes, and thematic depth. Authentication must be strong and unambiguous.*

### Modal Profile Synthesis & Narrative Integration:

*Purpose: Summarize the entity's unique modal status and how it functions within the broader narrative and world system.*

*   **Core Modal Identity:** `[Summarize the entity's defining relationship to world laws. e.g., Silas the Seer is defined by his unique Epistemic property (authenticated flashes of *possible* futures, always cryptic) coupled with a Deontic *obligation* to record but not interfere, creating immense internal conflict.]`
*   **Primary Narrative Function of Modality:** `[How does its special status drive plot or theme? e.g., Silas's visions provide ambiguous clues/warnings driving investigation plots; his inability to act explores themes of fate vs. agency.]`
*   **Key Interactions with General Modalities:** `[How does this entity's specific modal property interact with the *general* rules? e.g., Silas's visions operate *within* the broader alethic impossibility of true prediction; his deontic binding highlights the world's emphasis on non-interference with temporal flow.]`
*   **Consistency Check:** `[Are all depicted actions and consequences involving this entity fully consistent with its authenticated modal properties? Have any apparent contradictions been resolved? e.g., Ensure Silas never gives a *clear*, unambiguous prediction, maintaining epistemic limits.]`
*   **Potential for Conflict/Exploitation:** `[How can this entity's modal properties be used or exploited by others within the narrative? e.g., Factions seeking to force Silas to reveal more; attempts to bypass the Artificer Heart's sacred aura; finding the one weapon effective against the Paradox Hound.]`

**How This Markdown Document Guides Modal Property Design:**

1.  **Focus on Exceptions & Uniqueness:** Centers on defining properties that make an entity's relationship to world laws *special* or *unique*.
2.  **Direct Link to Modalities:** Organizes properties explicitly under Alethic, Deontic, Axiological, and Epistemic categories, reinforcing their function as direct instantiations of these laws.
3.  **Emphasis on Authentication:** Stresses the need for strong, clear authentication for these often powerful or world-altering properties.
4.  **Defining Interaction with World Law:** Requires articulating *how* the specific modal property relates to or modifies the *general* rules of the heterocosm.
5.  **Narrative Function Mandatory:** Demands justification for *why* this entity possesses this unique modal status in terms of its contribution to plot, theme, or conflict.
6.  **Consistency Check Integrated:** Includes prompts for ensuring the application of these special properties remains consistent with their definition and doesn't create logical paradoxes (unless intended and authenticated).
7.  **Granular Detail Encouraged:** Uses prompts and structure to encourage precise definition of the scope, limits, triggers, and consequences associated with each modal property.

By using this protocol, you can systematically design entities that embody the fundamental rules and exceptions of your world in compelling ways. It helps ensure that powerful or unique beings/objects feel like integral parts of the heterocosm's logic, rather than arbitrary plot devices, grounding even the most extraordinary elements within a coherent, authenticated framework.
