Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template designed to guide you in the **creation and evaluation of individual scenes**, with a specific focus on **"Scene-Painting"** – the art of localized, vivid description for immediate impact, as distinct from deep, systemic world-making, inspired by Doležel's framework.

This protocol helps you focus on crafting immersive moments, ensuring each scene has a strong atmospheric and sensory presence, while also prompting you to consider if/how these localized details might eventually connect to or require broader world authentication.

## Introduction: Crafting Immersive Moments Through Localized Detail

*This protocol guides the design and evaluation of individual scenes within [Your Story World Name], focusing on the art of **"Scene-Painting"**: creating vivid, atmospherically rich, and sensorially engaging localized environments. While distinct from deep heterocosm construction (world-making), skillful scene-painting is crucial for immediate immersion, tone setting, and providing context for character action.*

*Use this document to ensure each key scene possesses a strong sense of place and mood, built through carefully authenticated (for the scene) details. Consider how these details serve the immediate narrative and whether they have implications for broader world consistency.*

---

## I. Scene Spatio-Temporal Authentication (The Immediate "Where & When")

*Purpose: To establish the clear, immediate physical and temporal boundaries of the scene.*

*   **Authenticated Location:** `[Specific place, e.g., Investigator Kaelen's cramped office, Precinct 4; A bustling, steam-choked Undercity black market; The silent, dust-filled antechamber of a Memory Keeper vault.]`
    *   *Key Authenticated Spatial Features (for this scene):* `[e.g., Office: Overflowing data-slates, single flickering lumen-globe, view of perpetually rainy street. Market: Maze of makeshift stalls, oppressive steam from vents, crowded narrow passages. Antechamber: High vaulted ceiling lost in shadow, single stone plinth, thick layer of undisturbed dust.]`
*   **Authenticated Time:** `[e.g., Late evening, during the city's 'dimming hour'; Mid-cycle, peak market activity; Time feels 'stagnant', specific hour unknown/irrelevant.]`
    *   *Key Authenticated Temporal Features (for this scene):* `[e.g., Dimming Hour: City lights automatically reduce power, plunging office into deeper shadow. Market: Throngs of people, specific vendors present only at this time. Antechamber: No discernible change over time within the scene itself.]`

*   **# Design Check:** *Are the 'where' and 'when' of this scene immediately clear and sufficiently detailed for the audience to orient themselves? Do these details align with established broader world settings (if applicable)?*

---

## II. Dominant Sensory & Atmospheric Authentication (Scene-Specific)

*Purpose: To define the primary sensory experiences and overall mood created *within this specific scene*.*

*   **Visual Palette & Lighting:**
    *   *Authenticated Details:* `[e.g., Office: Monochromatic greys/browns, harsh single light source creating deep shadows, rain-streaked windowpane. Market: Chaotic mix of colors from vendor wares, flickering gas lamps, bioluminescent Undercity fungi, steam obscuring vision. Antechamber: Almost total darkness, single beam of light from doorway, outlines visible only by dust displacement.]`
    *   *Intended Visual Mood:* `[e.g., Oppressive, Intimate; Overwhelming, Dangerous; Ancient, Forbidden.]`

*   **Auditory Landscape:**
    *   *Authenticated Sounds:* `[e.g., Office: Constant drumming of rain, distant city sirens, Kaelen's own breathing, click of his Chronometer. Market: Shouting vendors, haggling customers, hissing steam, grinding gears from nearby workshops, alien languages, alarm bells. Antechamber: Profound silence, occasional drip of water, faint structural groans, protagonist's own heartbeat.]`
    *   *Intended Auditory Mood:* `[e.g., Confined, Tense; Chaotic, Vibrant, Threatening; Expectant, Eerie.]`

*   **Olfactory Profile:**
    *   *Authenticated Smells:* `[e.g., Office: Stale air, damp wool, old paper, faint ozone. Market: Spices, cooked meats, unwashed bodies, industrial chemicals, wet earth, exotic animal musk. Antechamber: Ancient dust, dry stone, faint metallic tang (unidentifiable).]`
    *   *Intended Olfactory Mood:* `[e.g., Stale, Confined; Overwhelming, Exotic, Potentially Noxious; Ancient, Lifeless.]`

*   **Tactile Sensations (Implied or Directly Experienced):**
    *   *Authenticated Sensations:* `[e.g., Office: Damp chill in the air, gritty dust on surfaces. Market: Humid heat from steam, jostling crowds, slick/uneven ground. Antechamber: Still, cold air, fine dust settling on skin, rough texture of stone walls.]`
    *   *Intended Tactile Mood:* `[e.g., Uncomfortable, Confining; Pressing, Unpredictable; Cold, Static.]`

*   **Overall Authenticated Atmosphere for THIS SCENE:** `[e.g., Aethelgard Noir Classic: Kaelen's office feels like a cramped, lonely outpost against a hostile, decaying city. The Undercity market is an assault on the senses, vibrant but dangerous. The antechamber is a tomb of forgotten knowledge, heavy with age and silence.]`

*   **# Design Check:** *Do the authenticated sensory details work together to create a powerful and consistent atmosphere for this specific scene? Do they serve the immediate narrative purpose (e.g., building suspense, revealing character through environment)?*

## III. Entity Constitution within the Scene (Localized Focus)

*Purpose: To define properties of entities (persons, objects) *as they are relevant and authenticated for this specific scene*, acknowledging that this may be a subset of their total heterocosmic definition.*

*   **Key Entity 1 in Scene:** `[e.g., Investigator Kaelen]`
    *   **Authenticated Properties Relevant to Scene:** `[e.g., Physical: Worn greatcoat, tired expression, prosthetic hand tapping data-slate. Functional: Observational skills focused on new case file. Psychological: Cynicism evident in dialogue, underlying weariness.]`
    *   *Function within Scene:* `[e.g., Receive information, react to client, establish noir protagonist archetype.]`

*   **Key Entity 2 in Scene:** `[e.g., Mysterious Client]`
    *   **Authenticated Properties Relevant to Scene:** `[e.g., Physical: Cloaked, face in shadow, voice a low whisper, expensive but dirtied gloves. Functional: Presents a specific data-crystal (OBJ_PlotDevice_01). Psychological: Appears nervous, evasive.]`
    *   *Function within Scene:* `[e.g., Deliver inciting incident, create intrigue, establish mystery.]`
    *   *Note on Undersaturation:* `[For this scene, client's deeper history, true affiliations, broader capabilities are intentionally unauthenticated, serving mystery.]`

*   **Key Object 1 in Scene:** `[e.g., OBJ_PlotDevice_01 (Data-Crystal)]`
    *   **Authenticated Properties Relevant to Scene:** `[e.g., Physical: Small, cool to touch, emits faint blue light. Functional: Contains encrypted information. Relational: Given by Client to Kaelen.]`
    *   *Function within Scene:* `[e.g., Physical MacGuffin, catalyst for investigation.]`
    *   *Note on Undersaturation:* `[Full data content, origin, and technological specifics are unauthenticated *in this scene*.]`

*   **(Detail other key entities present and their scene-specific authenticated properties)**

*   **# Design Check:** *Are entities within the scene defined with just enough authenticated detail to serve their immediate narrative purpose and contribute to atmosphere? Are you intentionally withholding broader information about them for later reveals (strategic undersaturation)?*

## IV. Interaction with Broader World Logic (Consistency Check)

*Purpose: To briefly consider how the scene's localized authentications align with or rely upon the established global rules of the heterocosm (if defined). This is where scene-painting might begin to touch upon world-making.*

*   **Reliance on Assumed AW Defaults:** `[e.g., Basic physics (gravity, sound travel) are assumed AW-like for this office scene. Basic human interaction norms apply.]`
*   **Alignment with Established Heterocosmic Modalities (If Applicable):**
    *   *Alethic:* `[e.g., Flickering lumen-globe consistent with authenticated unreliability of city power grid. Rain consistent with established Aethelgard climate.]`
    *   *Deontic:* `[e.g., Client's nervousness might imply the information being shared is illegal or dangerous according to authenticated Guild/Council laws.]`
    *   *Axiological:* `[e.g., Kaelen's worn office/attire reflects low status within Guild-valued hierarchy.]`
    *   *Epistemic:* `[e.g., Shadows and evasiveness contribute to epistemic uncertainty typical of noir.]`
*   **Potential for Broader World Authentication:**
    *   `Does any detail authenticated *for this scene* have implications for or require further authentication within the *global* heterocosm rules?`
    *   `[e.g., If Client mentions a specific Guild's involvement, this requires that Guild and its typical methods to be consistently authenticated elsewhere. If the data-crystal uses unique tech, that tech needs a place in the world's established alethic modality.]`
    *   `Action Item (If detail has broader implications): [e.g., Ensure OBJ_PlotDevice_01's tech aligns with Chrono-Tech rules in Master Codex, or flag for CAA review if it introduces novel principles.]`

*   **# Design Check:** *Does this scene feel like it *belongs* in [World Name] based on established global rules? Or does it introduce elements that seem to contradict or ignore the wider heterocosm (requiring either scene revision or world rule revision/clarification)?*

---

## V. Narrative Function & Generative Potential (Localized)

*Purpose: To assess what this specific scene contributes to the immediate narrative and whether its painted elements have further (even if limited) generative potential.*

*   **Immediate Narrative Purpose Served:** `[e.g., Introduces central conflict/case; Establishes protagonist's character/situation; Builds specific mood (suspense/dread); Reveals key piece of information; Provides obstacle for characters to overcome.]`
*   **Atmospheric Contribution:** `[e.g., Strongly reinforces Chrono-Noir tone through sensory details and character interaction.]`
*   **Limited Generative Potential (Beyond This Scene):**
    *   `Does any entity or detail authenticated *primarily for this scene* have potential to recur or be developed further in *other* localized scenes without requiring deep systemic world changes?`
    *   `[e.g., The Mysterious Client, if well-received, could become a recurring informant archetype. The specific *type* of data-crystal introduced could become a standard plot device for information exchange.]`
    *   `[e.g., The specific atmospheric conditions (e.g., 'dimming hour') could be used in other scenes to signal similar moods or times.]`
    *   *(Note: This is about localized re-use, distinct from the broad generativity of a fully defined heterocosm feature).*

*   **# Design Check:** *Does this scene achieve its primary narrative and atmospheric goals effectively through its specific authenticated details? Are there any elements painted here that are compelling enough to warrant further localized use or development?*

## Conclusion: The Art of Immersive Scene-Painting

*This protocol emphasizes the creative achievement in **skillful scene-painting**: the art of using **localized, authenticated sensory and descriptive detail** to create vivid, immersive, and atmospherically rich moments within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. While distinct from the systemic construction of the entire world's deep architecture, effective scene-painting is essential for grounding narrative action, establishing tone, and engaging the audience's imagination in the immediate "Now" of the story.*

*Focus on crafting scenes where the authenticated details work harmoniously to serve the immediate narrative purpose. Regularly check for consistency with broader world rules if the scene is part of a larger, systematically defined heterocosm. A world rich in compellingly painted scenes becomes a more tangible and memorable place.*

**How This Markdown Document Guides Scene-Painting:**

1.  **Localized Focus:** Sections are dedicated to the immediate "Where & When," "Sensory Atmosphere," and "Entity Constitution *within the Scene*."
2.  **Emphasis on Sensory Detail:** Constantly prompts for specific, authenticated visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile details to build atmosphere.
3.  **Narrative Function Centric:** Connects design choices directly to the scene's immediate purpose in the story.
4.  **Acknowledges Undersaturation (Local):** Implicitly allows for entities being defined *only* as much as the scene requires, with broader details remaining unauthenticated for that moment.
5.  **Checks Against Broader World (Optional but Important):** Includes a section to consider how localized scene details align with any established global rules of the heterocosm, bridging scene-painting with world-making.
6.  **Limited Generative Potential:** Differentiates the potential re-use of scene elements from the broader generativity of a fully defined world system.
7.  **Values Craft of Description:** Positions evocative scene-painting as a valuable creative skill in its own right, essential for immersion.

By using this protocol, you can ensure your individual scenes are powerfully realized, atmospherically rich, and sensorially engaging, serving as vivid windows into the specific moments of your Aethelgard story, while also maintaining awareness of their place within the larger (if separately defined) heterocosmic structure.
