## Introduction: Defining Dynamic Potential Through Authentication

*This protocol guides the definition of the **functional properties** of entities within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Following Doležel, these properties define an entity's potential for action, interaction, and influence within the world's established rules (modalities). They encompass **capabilities (abilities, skills, powers)** as well as crucial **limitations (weaknesses, costs, constraints, inabilities)**.*

*Focus on **authenticating** these functions clearly and consistently. Define not just *what* an entity can do, but *how*, under *what conditions*, at *what cost*, and crucially, *what it cannot do*. These properties are essential for narrative mechanics, conflict generation, character agency, and world coherence.*

### Functional Profile Summary & Narrative Role:

*Purpose: Synthesize the entity's dynamic potential and its function within the narrative system.*

*   **Core Functional Identity:** `[Summarize what the entity PRIMARILY does and how its key capabilities and limitations define its operational nature. e.g., Kaelen functions as a fragile but highly perceptive investigative node, constrained by amnesia and lack of authority but uniquely equipped to sense temporal disturbances. The Chrono-Viewer is a powerful but costly and unreliable window into the immediate past. The Gearwrights Guild functions as the engine of physical construction, powerful but dependent on other Guilds for fuel and potentially blind to emergent AI issues.]`
*   **Key Narrative Functions Served:** `[List primary roles in driving plot, creating conflict, providing solutions, embodying themes through action/limitation. e.g., Kaelen: Drives Mystery Plot, Explores Identity Theme. Chrono-Viewer: Provides Clues/Exposition (limited), Creates Resource Conflict. Aberration: Provides Threat/Horror Element, Embodies Chaos.]`
*   **Relationship to Alethic Modality:** `[How does this entity's function instantiate or test the world's laws of possibility? e.g., Kaelen's sensitivity pushes boundaries of normal perception. Chrono-Viewer operates near, but respects, the impossibility of time travel. Aberration *is* a living violation of stable reality.]`
*   **Key Functional Tensions/Trade-offs:** `[Identify inherent conflicts arising from its functional profile. e.g., Kaelen's need for information vs. his access limitations. Chrono-Viewer's utility vs. its high cost/risk. Gearwrights' production power vs. their reliance on Chronometers.]`

**How This Markdown Document Guides Functional Design:**

1.  **Action-Oriented Focus:** Centers entirely on what entities *do*, *can do*, and *cannot do*.
2.  **Capability/Limitation Balance:** Forces consideration of **both** strengths and weaknesses, costs, and constraints for every significant function, ensuring balanced design and inherent stakes.
3.  **Explicit Authentication:** Requires grounding all functional properties in authenticated sources (text, design docs, world rules).
4.  **Categorization for Clarity:** Separates innate abilities, learned skills, tech/magic functions, inabilities, vulnerabilities, and operational constraints for systematic analysis.
5.  **Link to Modalities:** Explicitly asks how functional properties relate to the world's fundamental laws of possibility (Alethic Modality).
6.  **Narrative Function Emphasis:** Requires articulating *why* an entity has certain functions in terms of its role in plot, conflict, and theme.
7.  **Detailed Prompts:** Includes prompts to push for specificity regarding how functions operate, their limits, costs, and systemic implications.
8.  **Structured Synthesis:** The summary requires articulating the entity's core functional identity as it emerges from the interplay of its capabilities and limitations.

By using this protocol, you ensure that the entities in Aethelgard are not just physically present but possess clearly defined, internally consistent, and narratively purposeful **dynamic potentials**. It helps you build the functional mechanics of your world alongside its physical form, creating a heterocosm where actions have meaning because they operate within a well-defined system of possibility and constraint.
