Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template designed as an **Ontological Framework & Entity Nature Checklist**. This protocol draws directly from the principles synthesized in **"V. Ontological Consequences: The Nature of Fictional Being"** from Doležel's *Heterocosmica*.

Its purpose is to help you, the creator, consciously **ground your world-building in a consistent ontology**, specifically Doležel's text-centric, property-bundle view. It serves as a reminder and a checklist during entity design and review, ensuring you are consistently treating your fictional entities as **textually constituted beings** defined by their authenticated properties, respecting their unique nature distinct from real-world counterparts.

# Story World Codex: Entity Ontology & Constitution Checklist
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica (Ontological Consequences)

**World:** [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]
**Codex Version:** [e.g., 0.1 - Ontological Framework]
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]
**Lead Architect(s):** [Your Name / Studio Name]

## Introduction: Defining the Nature of Being in [World Name]

*This protocol establishes and reinforces the **fundamental ontology** governing entities within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm, based on the principles derived from Doležel's framework. It affirms that entities herein exist **solely as constructs of the authoritative narrative discourse (codified in the Master Codex and primary texts)**, constituted entirely by their **authenticated bundles of properties and relations**.*

*Use this checklist during entity design and review to ensure consistency with this text-centric ontology, avoiding common pitfalls like assuming hidden substance, violating undersaturation principles, or blurring the lines between fictional and actual-world being.*

---

## I. Core Ontological Commitment: Textual Constitution

*Purpose: To affirm the foundational principle governing existence in this heterocosm.*

*   **[X] Principle Affirmed: Textual Genesis & Sustenance:** We acknowledge that all canonical entities in [World Name] are brought into being and defined exclusively through **authenticated predication** within the narrative discourse. They possess no reality prior to or independent of this textual constitution.
*   **[X] Principle Affirmed: Bundle Ontology:** We affirm that each entity **IS** identical to the **structured bundle of its authenticated properties and relations**. There is no underlying substance or essence beyond this textually defined collection.
*   **[X] Principle Affirmed: Semantic Nature:** We recognize that the "substance" of these entities is fundamentally **semantic meaning**, forged through language and validated by internal authentication.

*   **Self-Check Question:** When designing or describing an entity, am I thinking of it primarily in terms of its **authenticated attributes and connections**, or am I implicitly assuming a hidden depth or substance beyond the text?

---

## II. Managing Undersaturation (Necessary Incompleteness)

*Purpose: To ensure the inherent incompleteness of textually defined entities is respected and managed strategically.*

*   **[ ] Awareness Check:** Is it clearly understood that *all* entities in [World Name] are **necessarily undersaturated** due to the finite nature of textual authentication?
*   **[ ] Property Focus:** Does the design process focus on authenticating the **essential properties** needed for the entity's function and thematic role, rather than attempting (impossibly) to define every conceivable detail?
*   **[ ] Distinguishing Gaps:** Is care taken to distinguish between:
    *   **Ontological Gaps (Undersaturation):** Properties genuinely *undefined* for the entity (e.g., minor physical details, irrelevant history). These are accepted limits.
    *   **Epistemic Gaps:** Properties *authenticated* as existing but *unknown* to certain characters or the audience (e.g., a hidden motive, the contents of a sealed document). These drive mystery.
*   **[ ] Avoiding Unwarranted Inference:** When analyzing or writing, is care taken not to treat *inferred* or *reader-projected* details (used for gap-filling) as if they were **authenticated properties** of the entity itself?
*   **[ ] Strategic Use:** Are areas of undersaturation sometimes used **intentionally** to create mystery, allow flexibility, or guide audience focus? (Reference: Implication & Inference Protocol).

*   **Self-Check Question:** When asked an unanswerable question about an entity (e.g., "What did Kaelen eat for breakfast three Tuesdays ago?"), is my understanding that the question is ill-formed relative to the heterocosm because that property isn't in the authenticated bundle?

---

## III. Ensuring Specificity & Determinacy (Within Limits)

*Purpose: To leverage the power of authentication to create entities with clear, defined characteristics where needed.*

*   **[ ] Clarity of Authentication:** For properties *crucial* to an entity's function or the plot, are they authenticated **clearly and unambiguously** by an authoritative source?
*   **[ ] Defining Key Attributes:** Does the authenticated property bundle provide sufficient **specific detail** regarding the entity's core capabilities, limitations, motivations, and relationships to make its role and actions understandable within the world's logic?
*   **[ ] Contrast with Ambiguity:** Is the level of determinacy balanced with **intentional ambiguity** where appropriate (as noted in Undersaturation/Implication Protocols)? Not everything *needs* to be sharply defined, but *key functional elements* often do.

*   **Self-Check Question:** For a core entity, can I easily list its 5-10 most defining *authenticated* properties that dictate its primary function and limitations? Are these properties precise?

---

## IV. Maintaining Autonomy & World-Dependence

*Purpose: To ensure entities are treated as belonging solely to their specific heterocosm, deriving meaning from its internal context.*

*   **[ ] Internal Logic Prevails:** When defining or depicting entity behavior, is consistency maintained primarily with the **internal rules (modalities) and history of [World Name]**, rather than defaulting to AW logic or physics (unless AW logic *is* authenticated as the baseline)?
*   **[ ] No Unjustified AW Intrusion:** Are properties or capabilities derived solely from AW knowledge (e.g., assuming standard Earth biology applies perfectly to an alien creature without authentication) avoided?
*   **[ ] Cross-World Boundaries Respected:** Are entities treated as existing only within the [World Name] heterocosm? Are appearances in adaptations understood as creating *new*, related entities in *different* heterocosms (requiring their own analysis), rather than the *same* entity existing across media ontologically? (Relevant for transmedia planning).
*   **[ ] Contextual Meaning:** Is the meaning and significance of an entity's properties understood primarily through their function *within the specific semantic network and value system* of [World Name]?

*   **Self-Check Question:** Am I judging this entity's actions or properties based on Aethelgard's authenticated rules, or am I imposing external expectations from the real world or other fictional universes?

---

## V. Handling Fictional "Life" and "Consciousness"

*Purpose: To apply the textual ontology consistently to complex concepts like sentience, avoiding anthropomorphic projection.*

*   **[ ] "Life" as Authenticated Properties:** Is "life" for fictional entities understood as the presence of an authenticated bundle of properties associated with living beings *within this world* (e.g., specific biological functions, agency, responsiveness), rather than assuming AW biological criteria apply?
*   **[ ] "Consciousness" as Authenticated Properties:** Is "consciousness" or "sentience" for characters/AI/creatures defined *strictly* by the **authenticated psychological properties** (self-awareness predicates, complex thought processes, emotional states, subjective experience descriptions provided by authoritative narration)?
*   **[ ] Rejection of Hidden Minds:** Is there a conscious avoidance of assuming characters possess inaccessible subconscious drives, infinite mental depth, or phenomenal experiences *beyond* what the text authenticates?
*   **[ ] Complexity via Bundle:** Is perceived psychological depth understood as arising from the **richness, nuance, and internal consistency/tension** of the *authenticated* psychological property bundle, not from analogy to real minds?

*   **Self-Check Question:** When developing a sentient character, am I focusing on clearly authenticating the specific thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that define their inner world *textually*, or am I relying on the reader *assuming* a standard human-like consciousness exists behind the words?

---

## VI. Interaction with the Actual World (Creator/Reader)

*Purpose: To maintain clarity about the ontological boundary between the heterocosm and the Actual World.*

*   **[ ] Creator as External Source:** Acknowledge that the real-world creator(s) exist outside the heterocosm, providing the ultimate source of the authenticating discourse, but are not inhabitants *of* the world.
*   **[ ] Reader as External Actualizer:** Acknowledge that the reader accesses the world *through* the text and constructs a mental model, but does not ontologically *enter* the heterocosm.
*   **[ ] No Direct Mixing (Generally):** Uphold the boundary – characters typically cannot perceive or interact with the reader/creator, nor vice versa, unless metafiction is an explicitly authenticated modal property of *this specific world*.

*   **Self-Check Question:** Am I maintaining a clear distinction between the world *as authenticated in the text* and my own external intentions or interpretations as the creator, or the potential subjective experiences of a reader?

---

## Conclusion: Commitment to Textual Reality

*By adhering to this protocol, we commit to designing and analyzing the entities of [Your Story World Name] based on the foundational principle of **textual constitution**. We recognize that fictional beings **ARE** their **authenticated bundles of properties and relations**, existing solely within the semantic architecture forged by the narrative discourse.*

*This ontological clarity allows for:**
*   *Rigorous internal consistency.*
*   *Strategic management of undersaturation and ambiguity.*
*   *Clear definition of entity capabilities and limitations.*
*   *Avoidance of mimetic and psychological fallacies.*
*   *A deeper appreciation for the world-making power of language.*

*We embrace this framework to build a heterocosm that is coherent, complex, and compelling *on its own textually defined terms*.*
