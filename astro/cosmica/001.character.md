# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

**World:** [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

**Entity Type:** `Person (or Sentient Creature/AI designated as 'Person' for narrative purposes)`
**Archetype (Optional Starting Point):** `[e.g., Noir Detective, Cynical Mentor, Idealistic Rebel, Emergent AI]` *(Note: The goal is to move beyond the archetype via specific property authentication)*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `[Summarize the character based on the interplay of their key authenticated properties across all categories. e.g., Kaelen is constituted as an ontological paradox within Aethelgard: a being defined by the *absence* of authenticated History (amnesia) whose core Motivation is to reconstruct it. His Functional strengths (deduction, sensitivity) are intrinsically linked to his Psychological state (obsessiveness born of lack) and Physical reality (sensitivity causing pain). His Social position (Guildless Watchman) isolates him yet grants unique relational access (Undercity). He embodies the world's core themes of fractured Memory, the elusive nature of Truth (Epistemic), and the struggle for individual Identity against systemic forces.]`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `[e.g., Protagonist driving mystery/investigation; Audience viewpoint character navigating world complexities; Embodiment of core thematic questions.]`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `[e.g., Need for Answers vs. Fear of the Truth; Duty to Law vs. Need for Undercity Methods; Cynicism vs. Underlying Hope/Justice Drive; Analytical Mind vs. Unreliable/Anomalous Sensory Input.]`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `[Where can authenticated properties plausibly change? e.g., Recovery of specific memories (Historical/Psychological change); Formation of deeper alliances (Social/Relational change); Overcoming cynicism (Psychological change); Gaining new skills/tools (Functional change).]`

**How This Markdown Document Guides Character Constitution:**

1.  **Ontology First:** Explicitly grounds character definition in the authenticated property bundle, rejecting hidden depths.
2.  **Taxonomic Completeness:** Mandates consideration of properties across *all* relevant categories (Physical, Functional, Psychological, Social, Modal, Axiological, Historical) for a multifaceted view.
3.  **Authentication Focus:** Requires identifying *how* each property is validated within the text/Codex.
4.  **Emphasis on Internal Logic:** Prompts analysis of how properties within the bundle cohere or create meaningful tension *according to world rules*.
5.  **Undersaturation Management:** Requires acknowledging undefined aspects, treating them as part of the character's defined limits or narrative potential.
6.  **Function and Theme Link:** The summary requires articulating the character's narrative role and thematic significance *as emerging from* their constituted bundle.
7.  **Structured for Complexity:** Provides a framework for building characters with significant nuance and internal conflict *through* the careful combination of authenticated properties.

By using this protocol, you ensure your characters are deeply integrated into the Aethelgard heterocosm, with their capabilities, limitations, motivations, and very essence grounded in the specific, authenticated reality you are constructing through language, consistent with Doležel's rigorous semantic approach.
