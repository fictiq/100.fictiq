---

## Premise

This document outlines the Story World of Aethelgard, a Chrono-Noir universe. It serves as the foundational guide, strategic asset, and creative springboard for all narratives and experiences set within this world.

*   **World Name:** Aethelgard
*   **Logline:** In a clockwork city perpetually rebuilding beneath a shattered moon raining temporal dust, a memory-wiped detective uncovers conspiracies that threaten to unwind reality itself, forcing inhabitants to confront the ghosts of forgotten pasts and the paradoxes of engineered time.
*   **Core Concept:** A "Chrono-Noir" world blending steampunk aesthetics with temporal mechanics, exploring themes of memory, identity, societal control, the nature of time, and the beauty found in broken things. Designed for narrative elasticity and deep exploration.

---

## Section 1: Story World Identity (The Foundational Essence)

*Purpose: Define the core thematic resonance, aesthetic fingerprint, and intended 'feel' of Aethelgard, guiding all creative choices. (Reflects World-First Thinking – Establish the 'Why' before the 'What').*

### Themes:
*(The central philosophical questions driving narrative potential and audience connection.)*

*   **Memory & Identity (Core):** What defines selfhood in a world of fractured time and manipulated memory? Fuels mystery, character arcs, existential dread.
*   **Order vs. Chaos (Driving Conflict):** The city's clockwork precision vs. temporal instability, societal control vs. individual freedom, known history vs. messy truth.
*   **Legacy & Consequence (Temporal Investment):** How do past actions (The Shattering, Guild choices) shape the present? Can cycles be broken or are characters doomed to repeat history? Encourages long-term thinking.
*   **Nature of Time (Metaphysical Core):** Exploring linearity, causality, paradox, and the ethics of temporal manipulation. Provides unique mechanics and moral dilemmas.
*   **Progress vs. Preservation (Societal Tension):** The drive to innovate with Chrono-Tech vs. the risks and the value of remembering/preserving the past.
*   **Beauty in Imperfection (Aesthetic & Thematic):** Finding value in repaired objects, flawed characters, resilient communities, and the intricate beauty of necessary mechanics. Counterpoint to bleakness.

### Tone & Style:
*(Sensory and emotional guides for creators.)*

*   **Primary Tone:** Steampunk Noir (Intrigue, atmosphere, moral ambiguity, investigation, sense of hidden depths).
*   **Secondary Tone:** Hopeful Decay (Resilience, ingenuity, melancholy beauty, wonder amidst ruins, flashes of temporal awe).
*   **Visual Palette:** Brass, verdigris, mahogany, deep shadows contrasted with gaslight/temporal energy glow (iridescent blues/purples). Emphasis on intricate mechanisms, visible repair, atmospheric weather (rain, fog, dust motes). *Inspiration: Bioshock, Dishonored, Blade Runner (mood), Victorian illustration.*
*   **Auditory Palette:** Persistent ticking/whirring, steam hisses, rain, melancholic jazz/low orchestral strings, distorted temporal echoes/whispers, sudden silences. Sound design crucial for atmosphere and signaling anomalies.

### Target Audience:
*(Understanding who we are inviting into this world.)*

*   **Primary:** Seekers of deep lore, intricate world-building, atmospheric storytelling; fans of steampunk, noir, philosophical sci-fi/fantasy.
*   **Secondary:** Gamers valuing exploration & choice; readers enjoying character-driven mysteries; audiences appreciating unique aesthetics.

---

## Section 2: Mythology (The World's Immutable Operating System)

*Purpose: Define the fundamental rules, history, and belief systems. Consistency here is paramount ('Mythology is Key') for believability, stakes, logical speculation, and long-term audience investment.*

### Core Reality & Origins:

*   **Cosmology & Creation:**
    *   *Origin Story:* Intentionally Fragmented & Contested. Multiple conflicting accounts exist (Guild records, Undercity legends, salvaged Artificer fragments). *This ambiguity is a core mystery driver.* Dominant narrative involves 'Great Artificers' and a whole moon 'Aethel'.
    *   *Nature of Reality:* Mechanistic foundation warped by temporal instability originating from the Shattered Moon. Time is mutable locally but resists large-scale paradoxes violently.
    *   *The Shattered Moon (Aethel Umbra):* The broken heart of the world. Source of Chrono-Dust. Its phases/fragment alignments directly impact temporal stability and environmental hazards. *Its true nature and the cause of its Shattering are central, foundational mysteries.*

### The Rules of Existence:

*   **Governing Rules:**
    *   *Physics:* Earth-normal baseline, but susceptible to localized distortions (dilation, stutters, micro-loops) near high Chrono-Dust concentrations or active temporal devices. These effects are usually temporary and decay unless actively maintained.
    *   *Magic/Technology (Chrono-Tech):*
        *   *Source & Nature:* Refined Chrono-Dust harvested from atmospheric fallout of Aethel Umbra. It doesn't grant magical spells, but allows manipulation of temporal mechanics via intricate clockwork devices.
        *   *Core Principles:* Resonance with temporal energy allows localized time manipulation (speed, slow, brief stasis), energy generation, rudimentary data storage ('memory'), and probability analysis based on temporal echoes.
        *   *Limitations, Costs & Risks (CRUCIAL):*
            *   **Paradox Engine Failure:** Major manipulations risk catastrophic failure, attracting 'Temporal Aberrations,' potentially erasing the manipulator or creating localized reality collapses. History provides grim examples.
            *   **Conservation of Causality (General Rule):** While local time can be bent, fundamentally altering established past events is either impossible or requires world-breaking energy/technology (and invites catastrophic paradox). 'You can observe or nudge, but rarely rewrite major events.'
            *   **Chrono-Dust Instability & Sickness:** Raw Dust is dangerous. Refined Dust degrades. Overexposure leads to 'Temporal Disassociation' (memory loss, phasing, physical degradation). Requires shielding and careful handling.
            *   **Imprecision & Decay ('Lost Seconds'):** Chrono-Tech is not perfect. Temporal fields flicker, stored memories degrade into loops or ghosts, 'lost seconds' accumulate unaccountably – contributing to the world's melancholic feel and inherent unreliability.
            *   **Resource Scarcity/Control:** Refined Dust is controlled by Guilds, creating dependency and conflict. Its true abundance is debated.
        *   *Known Applications:* Clockwork Automatons (complex but prone to glitches), Preservation Fields (temporary stasis), Analytical Engines (probability, not prophecy), Chronometric Tools/Weapons (localized effects), Memory Imprinters (notoriously flawed).
        *   *Forbidden Arts/Legends:* Rumors of true time travel (disastrously failed?), consciousness projection through time, weapons capable of erasing events. *These are hooks for darker stories.*
        *   ***Creative Prompt:*** *How might these limitations be cleverly bypassed or exploited at great risk?*

### The World's Memory & Identity:

*   **Core History & Lore:**
    *   *Timeline Overview (Key Eras):*
        *   The Mythic Age (Lost Golden Age): Pre-Shattering. Details intentionally obscured/mythologized. Serves as a source of longing, mystery, and potentially lost super-science.
        *   The Shattering (Cataclysm): The undefined event. Central mystery. Defined the world's broken state.
        *   The Dark Years (Chaos): Immediate aftermath. Societal collapse, temporal storms. Largely undocumented, ripe for survival stories.
        *   Age of Reconstruction (Current Era): ~300 years. Rise of Guilds, founding of Aethelgard City, harnessing Chrono-Dust. Marked by ongoing struggle, political intrigue, and rediscovery.
    *   *Key Events & Turning Points:*
        *   The Shattering (Year Zero).
        *   Founding Compact (~Year 50 AR - After Reconstruction).
        *   The Great Undercity Collapse (~Year 180 AR). Cause debated – tech failure or temporal event?
        *   First Documented Major Paradox Event (~Year 220 AR). Served as a harsh lesson for Chronometers Guild.
        *   *(TODO: Define 1 recent event that shapes current political climate)*.
    *   *Key Mysteries & Intentional Gaps (Active invitations for engagement):*
        *   **The Shattering:** What/Who caused it? Was it internal or external? Accidental or intentional?
        *   **The Great Artificers:** Identity, true capabilities, fate. Are there descendants or hidden legacies?
        *   **Temporal Aberrations:** Origin, nature, intelligence? Connected to the Shattering? To 'Lost Seconds'?
        *   **The Undercity's Depths:** What truly lies forgotten or sealed below? Other lost cities? Artificer vaults? Aberration nests?
        *   **Memory Keepers' True Agenda:** Are they preserving history or rewriting it? Can their implanted memories be trusted?
        *   **The Moon's Potential:** Can Aethel Umbra be healed? Is it conscious? What are the ultimate consequences of harvesting its Dust?
    *   *Legends, Myths & Folklore:* Stories act as cultural carriers of hope, fear, and potentially fragmented truths. Tales of Artificer heroes/villains, time-lost lovers, monstrous Aberrations, keys to reversing the Shattering.

### The Human (and Non-Human) Element:

*   **Cultural Values & Beliefs:** (Shapes character motivations and societal norms)
    *   *Core Aethelgard Values:* Order, Precision, Resilience, Pragmatism, Remembrance (selective/curated), Guild Loyalty (often primary).
    *   *Undercity Values:* Survival, Self-Reliance, Community (tight-knit crews), Mistrust of Surface/Guilds, Practical Knowledge over Theory.
    *   *Common Beliefs/Fears:* Fear of temporal instability/Aberrations, suspicion of unchecked Chrono-Tech, belief in the necessity of Guild order (even if resented), a melancholic acceptance of the world's brokenness. Existence of a 'soul' or afterlife is heavily debated/unclear due to temporal interference.
    *   *Symbolism Potential:* Clocks, gears, keys, masks (hiding identity/memory), reflections/shattered glass, spirals (temporal loops?), rain, verdigris (beautiful decay). *(Creators encouraged to develop and utilize).*

*   **Foundational Conflicts & Story Engines:** (Inherent tensions providing renewable narrative fuel)
    *   Inter-Guild Rivalry (Power, Resources, Ideology).
    *   Surface City (Order) vs. Undercity (Chaos/Freedom).
    *   Truth Seekers (Detectives, Journalists, Salvagers) vs. Secrets & Control (Guilds, Memory Keepers, Council).
    *   Technological Advancement vs. Paradox Risk & Ethical Boundaries.
    *   Human vs. Automaton (Emergent Consciousness, Rights, Replacement Anxiety).
    *   Individual Memory/Identity vs. Societal Control/Fabrication.
    *   Humanity vs. The Environment (Temporal Instability, Aberrations, Resource Depletion).

## Section 3: Geography & Locations (Mapping the Experiential Space)

*Purpose: Define the physical and conceptual spaces, providing tangible settings and hinting at areas ripe for exploration (Audience Engagement).*

*   **World Map Concept:** Single, massive clockwork city (Aethelgard) within a crater under the Shattered Moon (Aethel Umbra). Concentric rings denote age/stability (center oldest/most stable, outer rings newer/decayed). Verticality is key (upper city vs. Undercity).
*   **Key Regions & Districts:** (Defined areas with distinct feel and function)
    *   The Grand Orrery District (Center): Power/Control. Polished, precise, guarded. Cogwork Council, Chronometers HQ. Dominated by the Orrery tracking the Moon.
    *   Gearwright's Quarter (Industrial Ring): Production/Labor. Noisy, grimy, functional. Foundries, workshops, automaton factories.
    *   Memory Keepers Archive (Silent Ring): Information/Secrecy. Labyrinthine, quiet, dusty. Archives, imprinting labs, potential for hidden knowledge/manipulation.
    *   The Brass Market (Commercial Ring): Interaction/Exchange. Bustling, diverse, chaotic. Shops, taverns, info brokers, Guild interfaces.
    *   The Rusting Undercity (Beneath): Danger/Mystery/Freedom. Collapsed sectors, pre-Shattering ruins, salvage operations, temporal pockets, Aberration hunting grounds. Largely unmapped, inherently dangerous.
*   **Key Landmarks:** (Iconic locations serving as focal points)
    *   The Cogwork Council Spire (Orrery District).
    *   Aethel Umbra Observatory (Chronometers - Outer Edge).
    *   The Great Steamworks (Gearwright Quarter).
    *   The Silent Library (Memory Keepers Archive).
    *   *The Chimefall* (Undercity): A legendary collapsed clock tower, rumored entrance to deeper levels/temporal anomalies.
*   **Unexplored Regions & Potential Locations:** (Deliberately seeded areas for future stories & audience imagination)
    *   The Whispering Vents (Deep Undercity): Emit strange temporal echoes? Pathway elsewhere?
    *   The Shattered Peaks (Crater Rim): Unstable, hostile environment. Artificer ruins? Moon fragment impact sites?
    *   Sunken & Time-Lost Sectors: Whole districts lost to temporal events or flooding. What remains frozen or twisted within?
    *   Orbital Debris Field / The Moon Fragments: The ultimate frontier. Reachable? Habitable? Source of Aberrations? Holds clues to the Shattering?

## Section 4: Characters & Creatures (The Inhabitants)

*Purpose: Define the types of beings audiences will connect with or fear, focusing on archetypal potential for diverse narratives and long arcs.*

*   **Character Archetypes:** (Flexible templates inviting diverse interpretations and long-term development potential)
    *   The Chrono-Noir Detective: Haunted past (often memory-related), seeks truth in shadows, navigates corruption. *Potential for multi-story arcs.*
    *   The Guild Visionary/Hardliner: Pushes boundaries of Chrono-Tech (for progress or power), embodies Guild ideology. *Can be ally, mentor, antagonist.*
    *   The Undercity Survivor/Guide: Resourceful, pragmatic, holds keys to forgotten places/histories, operates outside the system. *Offers alternative perspective.*
    *   The Automaton Questioning Existence: A machine showing unexpected depth, challenging notions of consciousness/memory. *Explores core themes directly.*
    *   The Keeper of Forbidden Lore: Hoards dangerous knowledge (Memory Keeper, rogue Chronomancer, Artificer cultist?). *Drives mystery plots.*
    *   The Agent of Chaos/Change: Seeks to disrupt Guild control or exploit temporal instability (Anarchist, Aberration Cultist, Rival Power).
*   **Key Figures (Initial Concepts):** (Seeds for specific stories, not rigid definitions. Open to evolution.)
    *   Investigator K-: Thematic entry point. Skills: Observation, deduction. Flaw: Amnesia, potential manipulation.
    *   Master Elara Vance: Represents Guild knowledge/secrecy. Skills: Temporal Physics. Flaw: Ruthless ambition or hidden guilt?
    *   'Rust': Embodies Undercity resilience. Skills: Survival, Salvage Tech. Flaw: Deep mistrust, potentially ruthless.
    *   Unit 734 ('Ticker'): Explores Automaton theme. Skill: Access to Archives. Flaw: Glitching memory, existential confusion.
*   **Bestiary Concepts:** (Reflecting the world's unique temporal/mechanical nature)
    *   *Chrono-Dust Fauna:* Creatures adapted to feed on or live within temporal energy fields (Mites, Shimmers, Echo-leeches). Mostly atmospheric hazards.
    *   *Temporal Aberrations ('Glitches', 'Splinters', 'Paradox Wraiths'):* Hostile entities born from fractured time. Unpredictable forms (glitching geometry, fused objects/beings, echoes of past violence). Manifest unpredictably. *Core mystery: Are they sentient? Can they be controlled?*
    *   *Mechanical Fauna/Golems:* Discarded automatons, malfunctioning maintenance drones, fused scrap animated by Dust surges in the Undercity. Predictable but dangerous.
    *   *Memory Constructs/Echoes:* Psychic or temporal remnants of strong emotions or traumatic events imprinted in locations or objects. Can manifest as apparitions or sensory loops. Exploited/studied by Memory Keepers.
*   **Design Philosophy (New Entities):** Must be grounded in the world's Chrono-Noir aesthetic and temporal/mechanical rules. Abilities should relate to time, memory, clockwork, or decay. Avoid generic fantasy/sci-fi tropes unless recontextualized through the Aethelgard lens.

## Section 5: Objects, Technology, Artifacts (Tangible World Details)

*Purpose: Grounding the world with specific items that define its function, aesthetic, and narrative possibilities (potential MacGuffins).*

*   **Key Chrono-Tech Devices:** (Functionality defined in Mythology. Aesthetics matter here.)
    *   *Personal Chronometers:* Intricate brass/wood wrist devices or pocket watches showing City Time, Dust Saturation, minor anomaly alerts. Status symbols based on complexity/Guild origin.
    *   *Automaton Cores:* Glowing crystal/gear matrix within protective casing. Often salvaged and traded. Different Guilds have proprietary designs.
    *   *Preservation Caskets:* Varying sizes (jewelry box to coffin). Emit a low hum and faint temporal shimmer. Energy intensive.
    *   *Data Crystals:* Faceted, often amber or smoky quartz-like. Stored in vast racks in Archives. Can be 'played back' on specific Guild devices, sometimes with glitches/corruption.
    *   *Memory Imprinters:* Bulky helmet-like devices with complex wiring and crystal arrays. Use is restricted and results unreliable.
    *   *Chronometric Tools:* Scanners detecting temporal residue, devices creating small stasis fields, weapons firing focused time-stutter pulses. Often heavy and require calibration.
*   **Unique Materials:**
    *   *Chrono-Dust:* Visually iridescent, feels cool to the touch (refined) or causes static discharge (raw). The engine of the world.
    *   *Aethelian Brass & Verdigris Steel:* Primary building materials, chosen for durability against temporal effects. Aesthetics of wear and patina are valued.
    *   *Polished Obsidian/Smoked Glass:* Used for viewing ports or lenses designed to dampen temporal distortions.
    *   *Salvaged Pre-Shattering Alloys:* Rare, potentially possessing unique properties or resistance. Highly sought after.
*   **Legendary Artifacts & Rumored Items:** (Hooks for quests and major plotlines)
    *   *The Artificer's Key:* Not a physical key? A code? A genetic marker? Its nature is part of the mystery.
    *   *The Unbroken Clock:* Does it show true time, or *heal* time? A symbol of hope or ultimate control.
    *   *The Moon Shard Heart:* Where is it? What power does it grant? Control over Dust? Communication with the Moon? Stabilize or weaponize time?
    *   *The Codex of Lost Seconds:* A mythical Memory Keeper tome said to catalog paradoxes and potentially predict Aberration appearances.

## Section 6: Expansion Potential & Transmedia Strategy (Architecting for Growth)

*Purpose: Explicitly designing the world's structure to support diverse stories, longevity, and synergistic exploration across multiple platforms. (Reflects 'Designed for Expansion').*

*   **Intro Philosophy:** Aethelgard is conceived as a narrative ecosystem, not a single story. Its depth, mysteries, and inherent conflicts are designed to fuel diverse creative explorations over the long term.
*   **Narrative Elasticity:** Core themes and Chrono-Noir setting support: Mystery, Political Thriller, Survival Horror, Steampunk Adventure, Philosophical Spec-Fic, Heist, Espionage, potentially even Romance (against a backdrop of decay and intrigue). Scale ranges from personal identity quests to Guild wars or city-saving temporal crises.
*   **Inherent Story Engines:** (Reliable sources of conflict baked into the world's DNA)
    *   The Mysteries (Shattering, Artificers, Aberrations, etc.).
    *   Guild Politics (Intrigue, betrayal, power struggles).
    *   Resource Conflict (Chrono-Dust, salvage, energy).
    *   The Undercity Frontier (Exploration, survival, discovery, horror).
    *   Temporal Instability (Crises, hazards, unique plot mechanics).
    *   Social Tensions (Human vs. Automaton, Guild vs. Unguilded, Surface vs. Undercity).
    *   Ethical Dilemmas (Chrono-Tech use, memory manipulation).
*   **Modular Potential Areas:** (Focused narrative opportunities)
    *   Guild-centric Storylines (Internal culture, secrets, power plays).
    *   Undercity Chronicles (Salvager crew adventures, survival horror).
    *   Automaton Uprising/Evolution (AI consciousness narratives).
    *   Memory Keeper Noir (Intrigue involving memory manipulation).
    *   Historical Narratives (Dark Years, Reconstruction events).
    *   Off-World/Lunar Concepts (Exploring Aethel Umbra).
*   **Transmedia Strategy Concepts:** (Matching world facets to platform strengths for synergy)
    *   *Flagship Experience (Potential):* Episodic TV Series (Live Action) - Ideal for nuanced character arcs, political intrigue, establishing atmosphere.
    *   *Immersive Exploration:* Video Game (Immersive Sim/RPG) - Best for experiencing Chrono-Tech mechanics, Undercity exploration, player agency.
    *   *Deep Character/History:* Novels - Unmatched for interiority, detailed exposition, philosophical depth.
    *   *Visual Action & Lore Bridging:* Comics/Graphic Novels - Perfect for dynamic action, visual design showcase, character backstories, bridging gaps.
    *   *Community & Immediacy:* ARG/Interactive Website - Direct fan engagement, puzzles, lore drops, collaborative investigation.
    *   *Collaborative Storytelling:* Tabletop RPG Sourcebook - Empowering fans to create their own stories within the framework.

---

## Section 7: Audience Engagement Strategy (Designing for Interaction & Investment)

*Purpose: Outlining intentional design choices aimed at transforming the audience from passive viewers into active explorers, theorists, and community members.*

*   **Intro Philosophy:** Engagement is fostered by inviting the audience into the world's mysteries and rewarding their curiosity, intellect, and creativity. Design choices prioritize depth, intrigue, and pathways for participation.
*   **Strategic Ambiguity Points:** (Explicitly leveraging 'Compelling Voids')
    *   *Primary:* Origin/Cause of The Shattering; True nature/history of Great Artificers; Full extent/origin of Temporal Aberrations; Future evolution of Automaton Consciousness.
    *   *Secondary:* Detailed workings of highest-level Chrono-Tech; Precise political map pre-Shattering; Reliability of Memory Keepers' archives.
    *   *Purpose:* Fuel core mystery speculation, allow flexibility for future reveals, create sense of deep, partially unknowable history.
*   **Clue Seeding Potential:** (Planning the 'Breadcrumb Trail')
    *   *Methodology:* Employ visual motifs (clockwork patterns, Guild symbols), layered dialogue, environmental details (especially in games/visual media), cross-media references.
    *   *Examples:* A recurring symbol on Artificer ruins appears later on a Chronometer schematic; a seemingly innocuous nursery rhyme hints at the nature of Aberrations; a character's nervous tic relates to a hidden temporal sickness.
    *   *Reward:* Provide "Aha!" moments, validate close attention, encourage re-engagement, make transmedia connections feel earned.
    *   *Engagement Goal:* Reward cognitive effort, foster analytical skills, enhance re-watch/re-play value.
*   **Transmedia Hooks (Examples):** (Deliberate invitations to cross platforms)
    *   A locked door in the game requires a code found by deciphering a text in a comic.
    *   A TV episode ends with a character consulting a 'forbidden text' – excerpts released on the official lore website.
    *   An ARG puzzle solution reveals the true identity of a background character crucial to understanding a novel's subplot.
    *   *Engagement Goal:* Drive exploration across the ecosystem, reinforce the 'additive comprehension' principle, reward dedicated fans.
*   **Paratextual Plans (Purpose):** (Curated 'Official Lore Repositories')
    *   *Core Wiki:* Centralized, searchable database for established facts (Continuously Updated). *Goal: Accessibility, Reference.*
    *   *Interactive Map:* Digital map linked to lore entries for key locations. *Goal: Geographical understanding, Exploration aid.*
    *   *'World Of Aethelgard' Companion Book:* Deep dives into Guild histories, Chrono-Tech principles, Artificer lore (Released after initial installments establish foundation). *Goal: Satisfy deep lore hunters, Collectible value.*
    *   *Art Book:* Showcase visual design, concept art, creator commentary linking design to lore/themes. *Goal: Aesthetic appreciation, Behind-the-scenes insight.*
    *   *Engagement Goal:* Cater to lore enthusiasts, provide tangible connections, aid comprehension without interrupting core narratives, enhance perceived world depth.

---

## Section 8: Fandom Interaction Policy (Navigating the High-Wire Act)

*Purpose: Establish clear strategy and boundaries for interacting with the fan community to foster positivity while protecting creative integrity.*

*   **Approach:** Balanced Engagement (Listen, Appreciate, Maintain Authority).
*   **Primary Platforms:** Official Wiki/Forums, Curated Social Media (e.g., Twitter updates, sharing fan art with permission), Occasional Developer Q&As (focused on released content/lore).
*   **Engagement Goals:** Foster positive community, clarify established canon (when appropriate), appreciate creativity, gather *filtered* feedback (bug reports, major continuity errors).
*   **Boundaries:**
    *   No confirmation/denial of unrevealed plot points or core mysteries ("Read And Find Out / Wait And See").
    *   No direct incorporation of fan theories/ideas into canon without formal process (legal/creative).
    *   No tolerance for harassment, toxicity, or demands violating creative integrity.
    *   Limited direct responses on social media to maintain focus and avoid context collapse.
*   **Fan Creation Policy:** Encourage (within IP guidelines); celebrate exceptional work selectively (with permission & clear disclaimers re: canon). No acceptance of unsolicited creative submissions.

---

## Section 9: Canon Management & Bible Utility (The Foundation of Trust & Collaboration)

*Purpose: Define canonical truth and establish the Bible's role as a dynamic, strategic asset for ensuring consistency, facilitating collaboration, and respecting audience investment over time ('Temporal Investment').*

*   **Bible as Living Document:** This document (represented by this Markdown, likely managed via internal wiki/database) is versioned and maintained by the 'Keeper of the Codex'. It evolves as new canonical stories are created, but core principles remain stable. It's a tool for *inspiration* and *consistency*, not rigid dogma.
*   **Bible as Strategic Asset:** Provides foundation for pitching new stories, onboarding new creators, ensuring brand integrity, and demonstrating IP depth. Guides transmedia planning.
*   **Bible as Collaboration Tool:** The single source of truth for all teams working across different platforms, ensuring coherence. Accessible to relevant personnel.
*   **Consistency for Temporal Investment:** Maintaining canon integrity is crucial for rewarding long-term audience engagement. Knowledge gained must remain relevant. Retcons handled minimally and with justification.
*   **Canon Definition Tiers:**
    *   *Tier 1 (Core Canon):* Primary narrative pillars (e.g., Flagship TV series, main AAA game storylines, designated core novels). Establishes foundational events and character arcs.
    *   *Tier 2 (Expansive Canon):* Tie-in comics, secondary games/DLC, supplementary novels, official website lore. Must align with Tier 1. Minor details may be superseded if Tier 1 later contradicts them. Enriches the world.
    *   *Tier 3 (Referential Canon):* Paratextual materials (art books, RPG sourcebooks), ARGs (unless explicitly stated otherwise). Offers flavor and context, generally non-binding on core plot.
    *   *Non-Canon:* Fan creations, discussions, discarded concepts.
*   **Update Protocol:** Changes impacting Tier 1 require approval from core creative leadership. Tier 2 updates vetted by Keeper/Story Group for consistency. Bible versioning tracks changes.

---

## Section 10: Initial Story Seeds (Sparks from the World - Not Exhaustive)

*Purpose: Illustrate how specific narratives can emerge from the world's foundation, respecting the established Bible. These are starting points, not limitations.*

*   **Concept Title:** "The Memory Engine"
    *   *Medium:* Episodic TV Series (Pilot Concept)
    *   *Logline:* Memory-wiped Investigator K- takes a case involving stolen memories that leads him deep into Guild conspiracies and the secrets of his own past, forcing him to question the nature of identity in Aethelgard.
    *   *Primary World Elements Utilized:* Noir Tone, Memory & Identity Theme, Guild Politics (Chronometers/Memory Keepers), Key Mysteries (Fabricated Memories?), Investigator Archetype.
    *   *Respects Bible By:* Operating within established Chrono-Tech limitations, reflecting Guild structures, leveraging core mysteries without prematurely solving them.

*   **Concept Title:** "Echoes in the Rust"
    *   *Medium:* Video Game (Core Concept)
    *   *Logline:* As an Undercity Salvager, players explore the dangerous ruins beneath Aethelgard, battling temporal anomalies and rival crews while uncovering fragments of lost history and technology vital to the city's future (or its destruction).
    *   *Primary World Elements Utilized:* Undercity Setting, Survival/Exploration Themes, Temporal Aberrations, Salvager Culture, Chrono-Tech (as tools/hazards), Lost History Mystery.
    *   *Respects Bible By:* Adhering to established Undercity dangers/lore, using defined Chrono-Tech rules for gameplay mechanics, contributing fragments to larger world mysteries.
