  NarrativeContext: "Protagonist arrives at L ickskillet, the gritty heart of alligator processing, seeking information or passage deeper into the swamps. This scene introduces the  town's character."
  Introduction:
    Preamble: |
      This protocol guides the design and  evaluation of individual scenes within Primal Mama, focusing on the art of "Scene-Painting": creating vivid, atmospherically rich,  and sensorially engaging localized environments. While distinct from deep heterocosm construction (world-making), skillful scene-painting  is crucial for immediate immersion, tone setting, and providing context for character action.
      Use this document to ensure each key  scene possesses a strong sense of place and mood, built through carefully authenticated (for the scene) details. Consider how these details serve the  immediate narrative and whether they have implications for broader world consistency.
  SceneSpatioTemporalAuthentication:
    Purpose: "To  establish the clear, immediate physical and temporal boundaries of the scene."
    AuthenticatedLocation:
      Location: "The  main public landing/docks of Lickskillet, a sprawling, muddy settlement built along a wide, slow- moving bayou distributary. Structures are a mix of repurposed shipping containers, hastily erected wooden shacks, and a few  more permanent buildings with faded 1970s-era siding."
      KeySpatialFeatures: "Rickety  wooden piers jutting into murky water. Fanboats and airboats of various sizes and states of repair moored haphazardly.  A central, open area muddy from constant traffic, leading to a row of buildings: a general store with a flickering neon \" GATOR-AID\" sign (chunky font), a smoky cookhouse, and a \"Bait & Ordinance\"  shop with barred windows. Oversized, wood-paneled solar collectors are visible on some rooftops, wired with thick, insulated cables ."
    AuthenticatedTime:
      Time: "Mid-morning, humid and overcast. The primary \"shift change \" for local gator skinners and processors is approaching or just happened."
      KeyTemporalFeatures: "A steady stream of  rough-looking individuals moving to and from the processing shacks further inland. The air is thick with the smell of the  morning's work. The overcast sky diffuses light, making colors appear muted but textures prominent."
    DesignCheck: " Are the 'where' and 'when' of this scene immediately clear and sufficiently detailed for the audience to orient themselves? Do these details  align with established broader world settings (Lickskillet as a processing hub, 1970s tech,  solar reliance)? Yes, the description aims for this clarity and consistency."
  DominantSensoryAtmosphericAuthentication: 
    Purpose: "To define the primary sensory experiences and overall mood created *within this specific scene*."
     VisualPaletteLighting:
      AuthenticatedDetails: "Dominated by muddy browns, murky greens of the water, and faded,  peeling paint (mustard yellows, avocado greens, rust oranges typical of 1970s palettes) on buildings . Occasional glint of chrome from boat engines or weaponry. The diffuse, grey light from the overcast sky. Flick ering neon sign. Chunky, utilitarian design for all visible tech, even newer solar panels have faux-woodgrain bezels or oversized  analog dials."
      IntendedVisualMood: "Gritty, Worn-Down, Functional, Resilient,  Slightly Oppressive."
    AuditoryLandscape:
      AuthenticatedSounds: "Slap of water against hulls and pilings. The  intermittent roar and whine of fanboat engines starting or arriving. Distant, rhythmic thumping or grinding from unseen processing machinery . Raised voices, gruff laughter, and occasional arguments from the locals. The buzz of large insects. Perhaps a scratchy  radio playing a tune reminiscent of Jerry Reed from the cookhouse, distorted through an old speaker with a chunky grille."
       IntendedAuditoryMood: "Rough, Working-Class, A Little Lawless, Background Hum of Industry." 
    OlfactoryProfile:
      AuthenticatedSmells: "Pervasive metallic tang of blood and rendered alligator fat.  Diesel/biofuel fumes from boat engines. Damp earth and decaying swamp vegetation. Frying food (gator nuggets?) from  the cookhouse. Unwashed bodies. A faint, acrid chemical scent from tanning or preservation processes carried on the breeze ."
      IntendedOlfactoryMood: "Pungent, Visceral, Industrial, Unsanitary but Familiar  to Locals."
    TactileSensations:
      AuthenticatedSensations: "Thick, humid air clinging to  skin. The stickiness of mud underfoot if one steps off the main boardwalks. The vibration of a nearby fan boat engine. The rough texture of weathered wood on railings or building walls."
      IntendedTactileMood: "Clammy , Gritty, Unrefined."
    OverallAuthenticatedAtmosphere: "Lickskillet Landing is the raw,  unvarnished gut of the alligator meat industry. It's a place of hard labor, casual danger, and a defiant, make -do spirit, all filtered through a distinctively grimy 1970s lens. It smells of work , blood, and swamp, and hums with a rough-edged energy."
    DesignCheck: "Do the authenticated  sensory details work together to create a powerful and consistent atmosphere for this specific scene? Yes, they aim to convey the gritty , functional, and somewhat hazardous nature of Lickskillet, consistent with its role in Primal Mama."
   EntityConstitution:
    Purpose: "To define properties of entities (persons, objects) *as they are relevant and  authenticated for this specific scene*, acknowledging that this may be a subset of their total heterocosmic definition."
    Entities :
      - KeyEntity1:
          Name: "A \"Dock Boss\" or informal landing coordinator (e.g ., \"Cletus\")"
          AuthenticatedPropertiesRelevantToScene:
            Physical: "Burly, weathered , wearing stained overalls over a faded band t-shirt (perhaps a stylized Burt Reynolds). A chunky, 19 70s-style datapad with a cracked screen is holstered on his belt, next to a large, practical  firearm. Missing a few teeth."
            Functional: "Directing boat traffic, collecting landing fees (in physical sc rip or bartered goods), giving curt information."
            Psychological: "Wary of outsiders, pragmatic, speaks  in clipped sentences."
          FunctionWithinScene: "Initial point of contact, gatekeeper for information/access, establishes  local authority and demeanor."
      - KeyEntity2:
          Name: "Pair of Gator Skinners returning from  an early shift."
          AuthenticatedPropertiesRelevantToScene:
            Physical: "Lean, sinewy, sp attered with gore, carrying well-worn tools (large knives, sharpeners with chunky handles). Their clothes are functional but patched.  One might have a primitive-looking automaton arm (visible gears, hydraulics, covered in grime, clearly marked as such, leading to a  slight \"stain\" in how others perceive them, but accepted for its utility in their dangerous job)."
            Functional: " Moving through the scene, perhaps exchanging a few words, heading for the cookhouse."
            Psychological: "Tired, focused  on immediate needs (food, rest), perhaps slightly boastful or complaining about their haul."
          FunctionWithinScene:  "Environmental storytelling, showcasing the populace and their work, illustrating the Automaton stigma/utility balance."
          NoteOn Undersaturation: "Their individual histories or deeper personalities are not relevant for this introductory scene."
      - KeyObject 1:
          Name: "A large, bloody tarp covering a recent haul of wild alligators on a fanboat ."
          AuthenticatedPropertiesRelevantToScene:
            Physical: "Heavy canvas, stained dark with blood, bulging with  the shapes of large reptiles. A few visible snout-tips or tail sections."
            Functional: "Transporting harvested  alligators (likely from the Saurian Sanctuary if the \"walls were open\")."
            Relational: " Focus of attention for the boat owner, source of the strong smell."
          FunctionWithinScene: "Visual and olfactory  reinforcement of the town's purpose, hint at the scale of the industry."
      - KeyObject2:
           Name: "A public notice board near the General Store."
          AuthenticatedPropertiesRelevantToScene:
            Physical : "Weathered wood, covered in tacked-on, printed (dot-matrix or mimeographed look) notices.  Some handwritten. Chunky plastic frame."
            Notices: "\"Saurian Sanctuary OPEN: Quota This Cycle,\"  \"WANTED: Fanboat Mechanic - Good Pay - See Jebediah,\" \"WARNING: Vampire Bunny Sightings Up river - Travel In Groups,\" \"Burt Reynolds Birthday Bash - Cookhouse - All Gator Beer Half Price!\"" 
          FunctionWithinScene: "Delivers world-building information organically (Saurian Sanctuary, vampire bunnies, deified celebrity influence , local needs). Reinforces 1970s aesthetic in information display."
    DesignCheck: "Are entities within the  scene defined with just enough authenticated detail to serve their immediate narrative purpose and contribute to atmosphere? Yes. The Automaton user  detail is specifically included to touch on that world rule locally."
  InteractionWithBroaderWorldLogic:
    Purpose: "To  briefly consider how the scene's localized authentications align with or rely upon the established global rules of the heterocosm  (if defined). This is where scene-painting might begin to touch upon world-making."
    RelianceOnAss umedAWDefaults: "Basic physics for boats, structures, human interaction."
    AlignmentWithEstablishedHeterocosmicModal ities:
      Alethic: "Solar power is functional (Solar Dominance). 1970s tech aesthetic  is enforced visually. Alligators are the primary resource being processed (Alligator Biogenesis implications for wild vs. GE). Vampire  bunnies are a known hazard (Vampire Bunny Propagation)."
      Deontic: "Gun ownership is prevalent and accepted ( Gun Ownership Regional). Potential rules for docking/trading (implied by Dock Boss). Automaton user stigma (present but tolerated for  utility). Regulated access to Saurian Sanctuary implied by notice."
      Axiological: "Alligator meat/parts are valuable . Firearms valued. Deified celebrities integrated into daily life (Burt Reynolds notice). Pragmatism and self-reliance are likely  local values."
      Epistemic: "Information disseminated via low-tech means (notice board). Local knowledge (Dock Boss)  is key. Awareness of local dangers (vampire bunnies)."
    PotentialForBroaderWorldAuthentication:
       Points:
        - "The specific \"scrip\" or barter system used in Lickskillet could be detailed  further if it becomes important."
        - "The exact nature of the \"GATOR-AID\" drink or other  local consumables could be defined."
        - "The process and rules for the Saurian Sanctuary \"walls opening\" and  harvest quotas are hinted at and would need consistent global authentication if the narrative delves into it."
      ActionItem: "[ e.g.: If the \"friction\" with meat oligarchies is to be shown, Lickskillet is a prime location.  The specific model/limitations of the skinner's automaton arm could be defined if automata play a larger role. Ensure the \" gator beer\" aligns with possible post-calamity brewing techniques.]"
    DesignCheck: "Does this  scene feel like it *belongs* in Primal Mama based on established global rules? Yes, it aims to directly embody  many core Primal Mama elements in a localized setting. It doesn't introduce contradictions but rather grounds the established rules in a  tangible place."
  NarrativeFunctionGenerativePotential:
    Purpose: "To assess what this specific scene contributes  to the immediate narrative and whether its painted elements have further (even if limited) generative potential."
    ImmediateNarrative PurposeServed: "Establishes the gritty, functional, and somewhat dangerous nature of Lickskillet. Provides a  believable entry point for a protagonist into this part of the world. Allows for initial interactions with locals to gather information or seek  resources. Sets a strong tone for adventures based out of or passing through Lickskillet."
    AtmosphericContribution: " Strongly reinforces the \"bayou-infused, retro-futuristic, strangely spiritual miasma\" (though more emphasis  on retro-futuristic and bayou here). Highlights the working-class, survivalist aspect of Primal Mama." 
    LimitedGenerativePotential:
      Points:
        - "The \"Dock Boss\" Cletus, the \"B ait & Ordinance\" shop, or the cookhouse could become recurring locations/NPCs for quests, supplies, or information  within Lickskillet."
        - "The notice board is a simple mechanism for introducing new local plot hooks or rumors in future  scenes set here."
        - "The specific brand of \"GATOR-AID\" or the \"All Gator Beer \" could become recognizable in-world products."
        - "The dynamic between those who use automatons for hard labor  and the social stigma could be explored in further character interactions within Lickskillet."
    DesignCheck: "Does this scene  achieve its primary narrative and atmospheric goals effectively through its specific authenticated details? Yes. Are there any elements painted here that are  compelling enough to warrant further localized use or development? Yes, several NPCs, locations, and cultural details offer potential for reuse  within Lickskillet-based narratives."
  Conclusion:
    Summary: |
      This protocol emphasizes the creative  achievement in "skillful scene-painting": the art of using "localized, authenticated sensory and descriptive detail" to create vivid,  immersive, and atmospherically rich moments within the Primal Mama heterocosm. While distinct from the systemic construction of the  entire world's deep architecture, effective scene-painting is essential for grounding narrative action, establishing tone, and engaging the audience's  imagination in the immediate "Now" of the story.
      Focus on crafting scenes where the authenticated details work harmoniously  to serve the immediate narrative purpose. Regularly check for consistency with broader world rules if the scene is part of a larger, systematically  defined heterocosm. A world rich in compellingly painted scenes becomes a more tangible and memorable place.
