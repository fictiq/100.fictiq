Scene ID/Name: SCENE_MamaAggyShack_GhostQuery
Narr ative Context: 'A desperate character, REX, seeks out the reclusive Swamp Witch, MAMA AGGY,  hoping she can perform a ritual to contact the ghost of his recently deceased (and suspiciously silent) business partner, who knew the  location of a hidden stash of pre-calamity tech schematics.'

Introduction: |
  This protocol guides the design and  evaluation of individual scenes within Primal Mama, focusing on the art of "Scene-Painting": creating vivid, atmospherically rich,  and sensorially engaging localized environments. While distinct from deep heterocosm construction (world-making), skillful scene-painting  is crucial for immediate immersion, tone setting, and providing context for character action.

  Use this document to ensure each  key scene possesses a strong sense of place and mood, built through carefully authenticated (for the scene) details. Consider how these details  serve the immediate narrative and whether they have implications for broader world consistency.

Scene Spatio-Temporal Authentication:
   Purpose: To establish the clear, immediate physical and temporal boundaries of the scene.
  Authenticated Location: "Mama Aggy' s shack, a dilapidated structure on stilts deep within the Gator's Tooth Bayou, accessible only by shallow-draft sk iff. The shack is partially hidden by thick drapes of Spanish moss and bioluminescent fungi clinging to ancient cypress trees." 
  Key Authenticated Spatial Features (for this scene): '[Rickety porch cluttered with dried herbs, gator skulls with  70s-era mirrored sunglasses, and strangely modified electronics (e.g., a transistor radio with extra antennae bristling like  metallic Spanish moss). A single, cramped interior room. A central, low table serving as an altar. Gaps in  the floorboards reveal dark, swirling water below.]'
  Authenticated Time: "The 'Gator Gloamin'' â€“ that  humid, purple-hued twilight when the cicadas reach their fever pitch and the veil between worlds is said to be  thinnest. Solar-powered lanterns around the shack flicker erratically, their light augmented by glowing swamp gas."
  Key Authent icated Temporal Features (for this scene): '[The sounds of the bayou are at their peak: frog croaks, insect  hums, distant gator bellows. The air grows noticeably cooler and heavier. Shadows lengthen dramatically, making the familiar seem alien .]'
  Design Check: |
    The 'where' and 'when' are clearly defined, leveraging Pr imal Mama's bayou setting and hinting at its spiritual/supernatural undertones. Details like the modified 70s  tech on the porch immediately root it in the world's aesthetic.

Dominant Sensory & Atmospheric Authentication (Scene-Specific): 
  Purpose: 'To define the primary sensory experiences and overall mood created *within this specific scene*.'
  Visual  Palette & Lighting:
    Authenticated Details: '[Interior: Dim, smoky. Light from a few sputtering kerosene lamps (with chunky , faux-wood plastic bases), the eerie green glow of what might be cultivated vampire bunny eyes in a repurposed 197 0s hamster cage, and the flickering orange of a small, contained fire on the altar. Strange, looping symbols painted in what looks  like dried blood and rust on the walls, occasionally catching the light. A single, bare bulb with a pull-chain , powered by a jury-rigged solar capacitor bank (with oversized analog dials), buzzes faintly overhead but is currently  off.]'
    Intended Visual Mood: 'Mysterious, Primal, Unsettling, Intimate,  Potentially Dangerous.'
  Auditory Landscape:
    Authenticated Sounds: "[The constant thrum of the bayou outside.  Inside: The crackle of the altar fire, Mama Aggy's slow, deliberate movements (rustle of fabric,  click of bone ornaments), the occasional soft *thump* or skittering from the vampire bunny cage, the bubbling of a pot  over a separate, smaller fire. Rex's own nervous breathing and heartbeat.]"
    Intended Auditory Mood: 'T ense, Expectant, Ancient, Close, with underlying notes of the uncanny.'
  Olfactory Profile:
    Authenticated Sm ells: '[Dominant: Damp earth, woodsmoke, pungent unknown herbs (some sweet, some acrid). Under currents: Stale water, a coppery tang (old blood? rust?), the faint ozone smell of old electronics occasionally  shorting out, and a surprisingly clean scent of alligator-fat soap.]'
    Intended Olfactory Mood: 'E arthy, Ritualistic, Unsanitary yet strangely ordered, with hints of decay and otherworldly energy.'
  Tactile Sensations  (Implied or Directly Experienced):
    Authenticated Sensations: '[The oppressive humidity of the bayou pressing in.  The rough, uneven texture of the wooden floor beneath Rex''s boots. The feeling of being watched. The slightly sticky residue  on any surface one might touch. A draft from the ill-fitting door.]'
    Intended Tactile Mood : 'Enveloping, Uncomfortable, Primordial, Vulnerable.'
  Overall Authenticated Atmosphere for THIS SCENE: | 
    A potent brew of deep Southern Gothic superstition, Cthulhu-esque unseen forces, and jury-rigged  1970s pragmatism. The shack feels like a nexus point, a place where the mundane rules of Pr imal Mama fray, and older, stranger laws hold sway. It's a place of last resort, reeking of both desperation  and genuine, dangerous power.
  Design Check: |
    The sensory details work to create a cohesive, unique atmosphere deeply rooted  in Primal Mama's core concepts. The 1970s aesthetic is present in the technology, contrasting  with the ancient magic.

Entity Constitution within the Scene (Localized Focus):
  Purpose: 'To define properties of entities (persons , objects) *as they are relevant and authenticated for this specific scene*, acknowledging that this may be a subset of their total heterocos mic definition.'
  Key Entity 1 in Scene: Mama Aggy (Swamp Witch)
  Authenticated Properties Relevant  to Scene: '[Physical: Ageless, with skin like cured alligator hide. Eyes that seem to reflect the swamp'' s murky light, missing a few teeth but possessing a surprisingly strong grip. Wears layers of patched, dark fabrics adorned with charms  made of gator teeth, small animal bones, and scavenged 1970s electronic components (resistors  braided into her hair, a vacuum tube worn as a pendant). Functional: Possesses knowledge of ghost rituals, commands respect /fear. Psychological: Wary, observant, speaks in a low, gravelly voice with a thick bayou draw l, pragmatic about payment for her services.]'
  Function within Scene: 'Gatekeeper of the ritual, app raiser of Rex''s sincerity and offering, potential source of aid or further complication.'
  Key Entity 2 in  Scene: Rex (The Seeker)
  Authenticated Properties Relevant to Scene: "[Physical: Mid-30s, dressed  in durable but stained swamp gear (faded denim jacket with band patches, worn jeans, tall gator-skin boots). Clutch ing a bundle wrapped in oilcloth (his offering). Looks nervous, sleep-deprived, but determined. Functional: Needs  information only a ghost can provide. Psychological: Desperate, willing to brave the dangers of the swamp and Mama Aggy's  reputation, possibly out of his depth.]"
  Function within Scene: "Instigator of the scene's core  conflict/request, provides the audience viewpoint into this strange corner of the world."
  Note on Undersaturation: "[ Rex's full backstory, his specific skills outside of desperation, and the exact nature of the pre-calamity schematics are  not fully authenticated here, only hinted at.]"
  Key Object 1 in Scene: OBJ_VampireBun nyCage_01
  Authenticated Properties Relevant to Scene: '[Physical: A repurposed 1970s orange  plastic hamster cage, slightly cracked, with some bars crudely reinforced with baling wire. Contains a pair of small,  unnervingly still rabbits with dull, matted fur and overly bright, ruby-red eyes. Faint scratching noises emanate from  it. Functional: Proof of Mama Aggy''s unique abilities, adds to unsettling atmosphere. Relational: Owned and maintained by Mama  Aggy.]'
  Function within Scene: "Atmospheric detail, subtle show of Mama Aggy's power/ eccentricity, potential future plot element if a bunny escapes or is needed for a ritual."
  Key Object 2 in  Scene: OBJ_Altar_Central
  Authenticated Properties Relevant to Scene: '[Physical: A low, wide tree stump,  smoothed by age and use, surface stained dark. Arranged on it are carved bone fetishes, bowls of murky liquids, dried  herbs, a few flickering alligator-fat candles in old soda bottles, and a surprisingly intact 8-track tape player with wires  leading to various metallic objects. Functional: Focal point for ritual magic. Relational: Central to Mama Aggy''s practice.] '
  Function within Scene: 'Centerpiece for the requested ritual, visual representation of the blend of folk magic and retro -tech.'
  Design Check: |
    Entities are defined with enough detail for their roles in this scene.  Mama Aggy embodies the Swamp Witch archetype within Primal Mama's aesthetic. Rex is a relatable desperate seeker. The objects  reinforce the world's unique blend of influences.

Interaction with Broader World Logic (Consistency Check):
  Purpose : 'To briefly consider how the scene''s localized authentications align with or rely upon the established global rules of the heterocosm  (if defined). This is where scene-painting might begin to touch upon world-making.'
  Reliance on Ass umed AW Defaults: '[Basic physics (gravity, fire needing fuel) apply, but are overlaid with the world''s specific  supernatural rules. Social interaction of seeking a specialist for a service is a recognizable human behavior.]'
  Alignment with Established Heter ocosmic Modalities (If Applicable):
    Alethic: '[Spectral Interaction: The premise of the scene is that ghosts  exist and rituals can contact them. Vampire Bunny Propagation: Their presence confirms this. 1970s Tech Aesthetic: Mama  Aggy''s tools and shack modifications reflect this. Solar Dominance: The jury-rigged solar power, however  crude, acknowledges its importance.]'
    Deontic: "[Implied permission/tolerance for Swamp Witches to operate , though perhaps outside formal societal structures. Rex is likely breaking no explicit law by seeking her, but it's a culturally  fringe activity.]"
    Axiological: "[Esoteric knowledge (Mama Aggy's) is valued.  Information (Rex's goal) is valued. The offering Rex brings will need to align with Mama Aggy's  values (likely not standard currency, perhaps rare swamp resources, pre-calamity curios, or a significant service).]" 
    Epistemic: "[Mama Aggy holds specialized, non-mainstream knowledge (Swamp Witch Lore). Ghosts  are a source of knowledge. The \"truth\" about Rex's partner's demise and the schematics is hidden and sought after .]"
  Potential for Broader World Authentication:
    Question: Does any detail authenticated *for this scene* have implications for  or require further authentication within the *global* heterocosm rules?
    Details: '[The specific ritual Mama Aggy  might propose, its components, costs, and risks, would need to be consistent if other characters attempt similar magic. The nature  of the ''payment'' she demands could define part of the Swamp Witch economy/barter system. If the 8 -track player on the altar has a specific magical function (e.g., playing ''spirit frequencies''), that tech -magic interface needs to be consistently applied or explained.]'
    Action Item (If detail has broader implications): '[e .g., If the 8-track is truly functional for magic, its operational principles should be noted for potential future use, aligning  with the ''1970s tech aesthetic'' constraint even for supernatural applications. The type of offering she accepts (e.g ., "three perfect gator eggs laid under a blood moon" or "a still-functioning pre-calamity  Zippo lighter") can define barter value.]'
  Design Check: |
    This scene feels like it  *belongs* in Primal Mama. The blend of supernatural, bayou culture, and retro-tech aligns with the established global  rules. The specific magical mechanics introduced (like the 8-track) would need further global authentication if they become recurring elements. 

Narrative Function & Generative Potential (Localized):
  Purpose: 'To assess what this specific scene contributes to  the immediate narrative and whether its painted elements have further (even if limited) generative potential.'
  Immediate Narrative Purpose Served : '[Introduces Mama Aggy as a key character and resource. Establishes the possibility and mechanics of ghost communication.  Allows Rex to state his immediate goal and desperation. Sets up the terms for the ritual (cost, danger, etc.).]' 
  Atmospheric Contribution: '[Strongly reinforces the "Cthulhu-goth-Southern-infused mag ics" and "strangely spiritual miasma" aspects of Primal Mama. Showcases the unique blend of primitive and  retro-tech.]'
  Limited Generative Potential (Beyond This Scene):
    Question: Does any entity or detail authenticated  *primarily for this scene* have potential to recur or be developed further in *other* localized scenes without requiring deep systemic  world changes?
    Details: |
      Mama Aggy could become a recurring source of occult aid or information for Rex  or other characters.
      The specific 'Gator Gloamin'' time could be used in other swamp scenes to signal heightened  supernatural activity.
      Vampire bunnies, beyond being atmospheric, could become minor pests, a source for rare alchemical ingredients,  or even (humorously or dangerously) 'pets' for certain characters.
      The concept of jury-rig ged 1970s tech being used for magical purposes (like the 8-track altar) can be expanded upon as  a unique feature of Primal Mama's magic system.
    Note: (This is about localized re-use, distinct  from the broad generativity of a fully defined heterocosm feature).
  Design Check: |
    The scene effectively introduces  characters, setting, and stakes through its authenticated details. Elements like Mama Aggy, her unique tech-magic, and the vampire bunnies  have strong potential for localized reuse and further thematic development.

Conclusion: |
  This protocol emphasizes the creative achievement in ** skillful scene-painting**: the art of using **localized, authenticated sensory and descriptive detail** to create vivid, immersive, and atmosph erically rich moments within the Primal Mama heterocosm. While distinct from the systemic construction of the entire world's deep architecture , effective scene-painting is essential for grounding narrative action, establishing tone, and engaging the audience's imagination in the  immediate "Now" of the story.

  Focus on crafting scenes where the authenticated details work harmoniously to serve the  immediate narrative purpose. Regularly check for consistency with broader world rules if the scene is part of a larger, systematically defined heterocosm . A world rich in compellingly painted scenes becomes a more tangible and memorable place.
