# Story World Codex: Place Constitution Protocol (Environment as Entity)
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Place Ontology)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly detailed framework** for the meticulous definition 
    of **Fictional Places** (locations, settings, environments) within the Aethelgard heterocosm. 
    Applying Doležel's ontology, it treats places not as passive backdrops, but as **complex entities 
    constituted by extensive bundles of authenticated properties** across multiple dimensions.
  scope: |
    Mandatory template for defining all significant canonical locations, from specific rooms or structures 
    to entire districts, regions, or even conceptual spaces. Ensures environments are richly textured, 
    functionally integrated, historically grounded, sensorially vivid, thematically resonant, and 
    internally coherent according to world rules.
  ontological_premise: |
    A place within Aethelgard **IS** its authenticated property bundle. Its perceived reality, atmosphere, 
    functionality, hazards, and significance derive solely from the **semantic information validated** 
    by the authoritative narrative discourse (Codex & primary texts). It possesses no inherent substance 
    or properties beyond its textual constitution and is necessarily undersaturated.

      "The Gearwright's Quarter IS constituted as Aethelgard's **grinding, polluted heart** (PHYSICAL/SENSORY), 
      a place of **immense functional importance** (industrial production - FUNCTIONAL) but **significant 
      environmental and social cost**. Its reality is defined by the **cacophony of machinery**, the **acrid smell 
      of industry**, the **visual language of pragmatic repair over aesthetic grace**, and the **rigid social 
      order** imposed by the Gearwright Guild (SOCIAL/DEONTIC). Historically rooted in the **Age of Reconstruction** 
      (HISTORICAL), it embodies the theme of **Order forged through relentless, potentially dehumanizing, 
      mechanization** (THEMATIC/AXIOLOGICAL)."]

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Place Constitution:

Highly Granular Properties: Breaks down Physical properties into extremely specific subcategories covering form, material, texture, color, light, state, sound, smell, taste, atmosphere. Functional properties detail purpose, resources, hazards, access logic. Social properties cover jurisdiction, inhabitants, culture, reputation. Historical properties cover origin, past events, physical traces, legacy effects. Modal/Axiological properties define special status.

Emphasis on Sensory Authentication: Mandates defining the dominant sensory signatures across multiple modalities (Soundscape, Olfactory Profile, Visual Palette, Tactile Feel, Ambient Taste, Atmospheric Feeling) as core authenticated properties.

Explicit Connection to Function/Theme: Requires articulating the narrative function and thematic contribution for each major property category and in the final summary.

Rigorous Authentication Citation: Maintains the requirement to cite sources for authenticated properties.

Deep Prompts: Includes highly specific prompts within each section pushing for detailed consideration of sensory experience, functional implications, social dynamics, historical layers, and thematic resonance related specifically to the place.

Undersaturation Management: Requires acknowledging undefined aspects within each major category.

Systemic Integration Focus: Encourages analyzing the place not just as a container, but as an active system component with specific inputs, outputs, hazards, resources, and influences on inhabitants.

Rich Synthesis: Demands a comprehensive summary articulating the place's core essence, function, interactions, and thematic role based on the entirety of its complex property bundle.

This extremely detailed YAML provides a robust framework for designing fictional locations as rich, multifaceted entities fully integrated into the Aethelgard heterocosm, ensuring they possess the depth, coherence, and sensory reality required for profound narrative impact and audience immersion.
