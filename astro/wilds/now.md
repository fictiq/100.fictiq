Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template specifically designed to help you define the **Global States of Affairs** for your fictional story world, directly applying the principles discussed in Lubomír Doležel's *Heterocosmica* regarding **"Predicating Global States of Affairs: Defining the 'Now' of the Heterocosm."**

The purpose of this template is to guide you in consciously **authenticating** the overarching conditions of your world *at a specific point in time* (the narrative "Now" you are focusing on), treating these conditions as predicated properties of the world-system itself.

## Introduction: Defining the Narrative "Now" Through Authenticated Predication

*This protocol focuses on defining the **Global States of Affairs** – the prevailing political, social, economic, environmental, technological/magical, and atmospheric conditions – that constitute the 'present moment' or the 'Now' of the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm for the specified timeline. Following Doležel's framework, these states are not mere background; they are **actively constituted through authenticated predication** by the narrative authority (i.e., you, the creator, defining canon).*

*Your task is to explicitly **predicate** these global properties onto the world-system or its major components. Be specific and consider the tangible effects these states have on the world's inhabitants and narrative potential. Use comments `#` for nuances, planned changes, or subjective character perceptions distinct from authenticated world-facts.*

## VI. Authenticated Atmosphere & Affective State

*Purpose: Define the authenticated prevailing mood, feeling, or emotional tenor of the world or specific locations within it during this period. While related to Tone (Section 1), this focuses on the *in-world* predicated atmosphere.*

*   **Predicated State:** `[e.g., Overall Atmosphere: A pervasive sense of melancholic endurance and low-level anxiety *permeates* Aethelgard, beneath a veneer of mechanical order.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: Narrative Tone Guide / Consistent Description*

    *   *# Authentication Source: Location Profile - Archive*
*   **Predicated State:** `[e.g., Temporal Anomaly Atmosphere: Areas affected by recent temporal distortions *feel* 'staticky' and disorienting, often accompanied by visual/auditory 'ghosting'.]`
    *   *# Authentication Source: World Rules - Temporal Effects*

*   **# Prompts:**
    *   *What is the dominant emotional feeling evoked by the world/location?*
    *   *Is it hopeful, despairing, tense, chaotic, peaceful, eerie, wondrous?*
    *   *How does the atmosphere shift in different districts or conditions?*
    *   *Are there specific sensory details consistently used to establish this mood?*
*   **# Key Implications:**
    *   *How does the atmosphere influence character mood and behavior?*
    *   *How does it contribute to genre conventions (e.g., Noir atmosphere)?*
    *   *How does it enhance thematic resonance?*

## VII. Temporality of Global States

*Purpose: Briefly consider the stability and potential for change in these predicated states.*

*   **Current Point in Timeline Context:** `[e.g., This definition applies immediately following the 'Guild Skirmish of '10', a period of heightened tension.]`
*   **Stability Assessment:** `[Are these states generally stable, rapidly changing, or cyclically shifting? e.g., Political/Economic states are volatile; Environmental state is slowly degrading; Social hierarchy is rigid but facing challenges.]`
*   **Recent Significant Changes:** `[List any major shifts in global states authenticated as occurring shortly before this defined 'Now', e.g., The recent failure of the Western Steamworks significantly impacted energy prices and Gearwright influence.]`
*   **Anticipated/Foreshadowed Changes:** `[Are there authenticated hints or prophecies suggesting imminent shifts in global states? e.g., Chronometer Guild predicts increased temporal storm activity due to lunar alignment.]`

---

## VIII. Interconnections Between Global States

*Purpose: Briefly note key causal or influential links between the different predicated states, reinforcing the systemic view.*

*   **Example Connection:** `[e.g., Poor Economic Conditions exacerbate Social Unrest and fuel Undercity black markets.]`
*   **Example Connection:** `[e.g., Environmental Temporal Instability directly impacts Resource Availability (Chrono-Dust harvesting) and Political Stability (blame assigned to Guilds).]`
*   **Example Connection:** `[e.g., Dominant Ideology (Clockwork Determinism) influences both Social Norms and attitudes towards Technological Advancement.]`
*   `# Prompt: How does the state of one category (e.g., Politics) directly influence another (e.g., Economics or Social Mood)? Identify key feedback loops.`

---

## IX. Methodological Notes for the Creator

*   **Authentication is Canon:** Treat the states predicated here as established facts of your world for this timeline. Consistency is key for believability and rewarding audience investment.
*   **Specificity Creates Reality:** Avoid vague terms. Instead of "things were bad," predicate *specific* conditions ("Resource scarcity led to rationing," "Public morale was low due to curfew"). Use vivid sensory language where appropriate.
*   **Show, Don't Just Tell (in Narrative):** While this document *predicates* states directly, your narratives should ideally *show* these states through character experiences, environmental details, and plot events, rather than relying solely on exposition dumps. This document provides the consistent foundation for that showing.
*   **Evolve Intentionally:** If global states change significantly during your narrative, return to this document (or create a new version for a new era) to authenticate the new state, ensuring continuity. Track the *causes* of these changes.
*   **Connect to Micro:** Consider how these global states directly impact the lives, choices, and properties/relations of your individual entities defined elsewhere in the Codex.

**How this Markdown Template Facilitates Defining the "Now":**

1.  **Structured Categories:** Breaks down the complex "state of the world" into manageable, distinct categories (Political, Social, Economic, etc.).
2.  **Predication Focus:** Uses the `Predicated State:` format to constantly remind the creator they are *authenticating facts* for their world, not just brainstorming ideas.
3.  **Sensory Integration:** While the previous template focused on sensory details *of entities*, this one encourages thinking about the sensory reality *of the global state* itself (e.g., atmospheric descriptions, prevailing smells/sounds of an era or place).
4.  **Temporal Awareness:** Explicitly includes sections on the timeline context and potential for change, grounding the "Now" within the world's history and future potential.
5.  **Systemic Thinking Prompts:** The "Interconnections" section encourages the creator to think about how different aspects of the world state influence each other, fostering a more dynamic and coherent world system.
6.  **Clear Purpose:** Each section begins with a stated purpose linked back to Doležel's concepts, keeping the theoretical underpinning clear.
7.  **Actionable Prompts & Implications:** Includes guiding questions and prompts to consider the narrative impact of each predicated state.

By using this template, you can systematically build a rich, detailed, and internally consistent picture of your story world's present condition, establishing the crucial context needed for compelling characters and meaningful narratives to emerge, all grounded in the rigorous framework provided by Doležel's theory of the heterocosm.
