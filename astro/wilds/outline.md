Okay, Artist of Worlds, let's use the Aethelgard Core World Codex to outline plot points for a family mourning the passing of their central household "computer." In Aethelgard, this wouldn't be a silicon chip device, but likely a complex **Clockwork Cogitator** or perhaps a specialized **Memory Automaton** central to the family's life and records.

Here are the plot points, infused with Aethelgard's essence:

**Setup:**

1.  **The Heart Stops Ticking:** The story opens in a modest family dwelling, perhaps in the lower rings of Aethelgard City or near the Gearwright Quarter. Their central Clockwork Cogitator – a complex assembly of gears, vacuum tubes, and Chrono-Dust infused crystals that manages household schedules, accounts, perhaps stores precious recorded memories (audio/visual imprints via Chrono-Tech) – grinds to a halt. Its internal chronometers cease, the hum dies, the indicator lights flicker out.
2.  **Immediate Impact:** The family (e.g., parents, child(ren), maybe an elderly relative) gathers around the silent machine. There's immediate sadness – this wasn't just a tool, it held *memories* (Theme: Memory & Identity). There's also practical panic: Did it store the access codes for their ration dispenser? The schedule for the child's Guild apprenticeship interviews? The only recordings of a deceased grandparent? (Conflict: Order vs. Chaos, Legacy & Consequence).
3.  **Familiar Rituals Fail:** They attempt the usual "percussive maintenance" or winding keys, but the intricate clockwork remains still. The faint scent of ozone or burnt Chrono-Dust lingers (Hazard: Chrono-Dust instability).

**Inciting Incident:**

4.  **The Failed Revival:** The most technically adept family member tries basic repairs, opening a panel to reveal warped gears, a cracked primary Chrono-Crystal, or fused wiring. They realize it's beyond their skill – the core temporal regulation mechanism or the Memory Matrix seems irrevocably damaged. (Mythology: Chrono-Tech Imprecision & Decay).

**Rising Action:**

5.  **Seeking Expertise - The Guild Dilemma:** Their first thought is the Gearwrights Guild or perhaps the Chronometers Guild. Inquiry reveals the cost of assessment, let alone repair, is exorbitant, requiring significant payment or a favour owed to the Guild (Faction: Guild Power, Resource Cost). Furthermore, Guild technicians might wipe non-essential data (the precious memories) or confiscate the Cogitator if it shows signs of unauthorized modification or temporal instability (Conflict: Truth vs. Secrecy/Manipulation).
6.  **Whispers of the Undercity:** An acquaintance suggests a "Scrapper-Tech" in the Rusting Undercity – cheaper, perhaps more discreet, but dangerous. Venturing down means navigating unstable walkways, potential encounters with Temporal Aberrations drawn to malfunctioning tech, and dealing with unreliable, potentially untrustworthy individuals (Setting: Undercity, Order vs. Chaos).
7.  **The Weight of Memories:** The family argues. Is preserving the *function* most important (survival, order), or recovering the irreplaceable *memories* (identity, legacy)? One member might reveal a secret stored only on the Cogitator, raising the stakes. Perhaps symptoms of Temporal Sickness subtly appear in one member due to past exposure near the failing machine (Mythology: Temporal Sickness).
8.  **A Desperate Choice & Journey:** They decide on a path – either commit to the Guild's steep price (perhaps taking a risky Guild loan/contract) or brave the Undercity.
    *   *(If Guild):* They navigate the bureaucracy, potentially facing invasive questions from Memory Keepers if data recovery is involved.
    *   *(If Undercity):* They make a perilous journey downwards, bartering salvaged goods for safe passage or information, constantly wary of the dangers.
9.  **The Diagnosis & The Cost:** Whether Guild or Scrapper-Tech, the diagnosis is grim: severe Chrono-Core degradation due to accumulated 'Lost Seconds' or exposure to a minor temporal flux. Repair requires rare, refined Chrono-Dust and carries a Paradox Risk. Memory retrieval is possible but might be fragmented, corrupted, or require interfacing with potentially unstable Memory Keeper archives (Mythology: Chrono-Tech Limitations, Core Mysteries link?). The true cost becomes clear – financial ruin, dangerous favours, or sacrificing the very memories they sought to save.

**Climax:**

10. **The Final Attempt:**
    *   *(Guild Path):* In a sterile Guild workshop, the family watches anxiously as technicians work on the Cogitator. A tense moment occurs – an energy spike, a warning klaxon – highlighting the Paradox Risk. Success is uncertain.
    *   *(Undercity Path):* In a flickering workshop amidst the Undercity's clangor, the Scrapper-Tech performs a jury-rigged repair. Suddenly, the power surge attracts a minor Temporal Aberration, forcing the family and the tech to fend it off while trying to complete the delicate work.
11. **Partial Echoes:** The repair/retrieval attempt concludes. The Cogitator whirs back to life, but *partially*. Some functions are restored, but others are gone. Crucially, the memories are recovered, but they are glitched, skipping like 'Lost Seconds', with ghostly static or temporal distortions – echoes rather than perfect replicas (Theme: Memory & Identity fragmentation, Tone: Hopeful Decay).

**Falling Action:**

12. **Living with the Ghost:** The family brings the altered Cogitator home. They adapt to its new quirks. Listening to the fragmented memories is poignant, a constant reminder of loss but also of what remains. They accept the imperfection as part of life in Aethelgard (Tone: Hopeful Decay, Resilience).
13. **Loose Ends & Lingering Questions:** If they dealt with the Guild, they now have obligations. If they went to the Undercity, they might have made dangerous contacts or enemies. The cause of the initial failure might remain ambiguous – was it just decay, or linked to something larger (Core Mystery hint)?

**Resolution:**

14. **A New Kind of Hearth:** The family gathers, not around a perfectly functioning machine, but around one that bears the scars of time and reality in Aethelgard. They find solace not in perfect recall, but in the shared experience of loss and adaptation. They look out their window towards the distant glow of Aethel Umbra, the source of the dust that powers their world and simultaneously ensures its imperfection. Their mourning shifts from the machine itself to the nature of memory and existence in their Chrono-Noir world. The focus is on their bond, strengthened by the ordeal.
