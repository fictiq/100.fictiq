Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template designed specifically to help you define **Fictional Objects** within your story world, rigorously applying the principles discussed in **"III. Fictional Objects (Things): Bundles Focused on Function and Description"** from Doležel's *Heterocosmica*.

This protocol emphasizes defining objects not just by their appearance, but primarily through their **authenticated functional properties, limitations, and their role within the world's systems**, treating them as textually constituted property bundles.

## Introduction: Defining Objects Through Authenticated Properties & Function

*This protocol guides the definition of significant **inanimate objects** (artifacts, technologies, tools, key props, etc.) within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, these objects exist solely as **bundles of properties authenticated** by the narrative discourse (this Codex, core narratives). Their reality is textual, not necessarily analogous to real-world counterparts.*

*Emphasis is placed on defining not only their **Physical Properties** (appearance, material) but, crucially, their **Functional Properties** (capabilities, limitations, costs, operational rules) and their **Relational Properties** (ownership, history, systemic role). Ensure properties are clearly authenticated and internally consistent with world modalities.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this object. Focus on function and physical description.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Tangible Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the object's perceivable reality.*
    *   `- Form & Structure: [e.g., Handheld metallic device resembling complex pocket watch; Ornate key forged from unknown crystalline metal; Cylindrical brass casing housing intricate gear matrix; Heavy, floor-length woolen coat.]` # Auth: [Source]

### Object Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity and role arising from the object's property bundle.*

*   **Core Functional/Physical Essence:** `[Summarize the object based on its most defining properties. e.g., The Chrono-Viewer Mk3 is constituted as a complex but flawed **diagnostic tool** (Function) housed in durable but worn **brass** (Physical). Its core capability (viewing echoes) is severely constrained by **authenticated limitations** (range, duration, cost, risk), making it a source of **limited knowledge and narrative friction** rather than an easy solution.]`
*   **Primary Narrative Role(s):** `[Define its main function(s) in driving plot or characterizing entities. e.g., Information Source (Limited/Flawed); Plot Device (Requires specific fuel/use); Source of Conflict (Theft/Control); Character Prop (Defines Kaelen's investigative nature); Thematic Object (Representing unreliable memory/cost of knowledge).]`
*   **Key Systemic Interactions:** `[How does it connect to broader systems? e.g., Directly tied to Chrono-Tech system & its rules; impacts Economy (Dust usage/black market); possession affects Social/Political standing.]`
*   **Undersaturation Note:** `[Highlight key undefined aspects limiting its function or providing mystery. e.g., Precise failure rate under stress; Full range of echoes it *cannot* perceive.]`

**How This Markdown Document Guides Object Design:**

1.  **Function-Forward:** While including physical details, it places strong emphasis on defining the object's **authenticated functions, limitations, costs, and operational rules** first and foremost.
2.  **Systemic Context:** Requires defining the object's **social/relational properties** (ownership, legal status, who seeks it) and **historical properties** (origin, past uses), integrating it into the world's networks.
3.  **Modal/Axiological Consideration:** Prompts specific thought about whether the object possesses unique status regarding world laws or inherent value within the world's system.
4.  **Rigorous Authentication:** Maintains the requirement to base all properties on authenticated textual evidence.
5.  **Specificity:** Pushes for precise definitions of capabilities and limitations rather than vague descriptions.
6.  **Narrative Purpose:** The summary requires articulating the object's specific *narrative functions* based on its constituted properties.
7.  **Undersaturation Management:** Encourages conscious decision-making about which functional or historical details remain undefined.

By using this protocol, you ensure that objects in Aethelgard are treated with the same ontological rigor as characters or places. They become well-defined **functional nodes** within the heterocosm, constituted by specific bundles of properties that dictate their role, significance, and interaction with the world's rules, rather than just being passive props or ill-defined plot devices.
