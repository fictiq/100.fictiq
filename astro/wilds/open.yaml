# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol guides the **conscious design** of the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm, 
    translating theoretical principles (derived from Doležel's framework on authentication, 
    modal structures, systemic interplay, and undersaturation) into practical considerations 
    for world-building and narrative development. 
  focus: |
    Leveraging textual authentication strategically to create a world that is coherent, 
    engaging, narratively generative, and thematically resonant. This serves as a checklist 
    and guide for purposeful design.

# --- I. World-Building as Strategic Authentication ---
strategic_authentication:
  core_principle: |
    Recognize that every piece of information presented authoritatively **authenticates** 
    a fact within the heterocosm. Design choices are acts of strategic authentication.
  key_design_questions:
    - question: "What core facts (Mythology, Rules, History, Setting) are **essential** to authenticate upfront for coherence?"
    - question: "How will information be authenticated: **directly** (authoritative voice) vs. **filtered** (character perspectives, potentially unreliable)?"
    - question: "What aspects should remain **intentionally unauthenticated/ambiguous** (strategic undersaturation) for mystery/flexibility?"
    - question: "How will the **mode of authentication** (statement, depiction, evidence, document) be used strategically for pacing/effect?"
    - question: "Are there plans for **revealing/altering** authenticated facts later? How will consistency be maintained?"
  actionable_design_principles:
    - principle: "Be Deliberate: Make conscious choices about what is 'true' for your world."
    - principle: "Control Narrative Voice: Understand the power/reliability of your chosen authority."
    - principle: "Map Mysteries: Explicitly list ambiguities alongside facts in the Codex."
    - principle: "Vary Authentication Methods: Use diverse techniques for richness."
    - principle: "Plan for Reveals: Ensure earlier authentications allow for later developments without flat contradiction."
  codex_link: "Ensure core World Bible/Codex clearly distinguishes authenticated facts, character beliefs, and intentional ambiguities."

# --- II. Designing History for Depth & Narrative Drive ---
designing_history:
  core_principle: |
    Authenticated history provides essential context, motivation, and conflict. 
    Design the past to actively shape the narrative present.
  key_design_questions:
    - question: "What **key historical events/figures/eras** are necessary to authenticate to explain the 'Now'?"
    - question: "What **historical mysteries or gaps** can be embedded to drive plot and audience engagement?"
    - question: "How will history be **authenticated** (narration, flashbacks, documents, ruins, oral tradition)? Reliability implications?"
    *   - question: "How do different **factions/characters** possess differing (authenticated *as belief*) versions of history?"
    *   - question: "What **sensory legacies** does the authenticated past leave on the present?"
    *   - question: "How does the **thematic resonance** of the past inform the present narrative?"
  actionable_design_principles:
    - principle: "Integrate Past & Present: Design historical elements with clear consequences in the 'Now'."
    - principle: "Seed Historical Clues: Use artifacts, environment, fragmented texts."
    - principle: "Control Historical Knowledge: Use unreliable sources or lost records strategically."
    - principle: "Make History Tangible: Describe sensory experiences of historical remnants."
    - principle: "Design for Expansion (Optional): Leave historical periods ripe for future exploration."
  codex_link: "Ensure Historical Authentication Protocol details core events, figures, mysteries, and methods."

# --- III. Designing Global States for Context & Conflict ---
designing_global_states:
  core_principle: |
    Authenticated global states (political, social, environmental, etc.) create the immediate 
    context that shapes possibility and generates narrative tension.
  key_design_questions:
    - question: "What **prevailing conditions** ('Now') are necessary to authenticate for core conflicts/atmosphere?"
    - question: "How do different authenticated global states (**Political, Social, Economic, Environmental, Tech/Magic, Atmospheric**) **interact and influence** each other?"
    - question: "What are the dominant **sensory experiences** associated with these global states?"
    - question: "Are these global states **stable or volatile**? What forces drive change or stasis?"
    - question: "How do these states create specific **challenges or opportunities** for different entities?"
  actionable_design_principles:
    - principle: "Authenticate Clearly: Define the baseline 'Now' conditions authoritatively."
    - principle: "Build In Tension: Design global states with inherent conflicts/dangers."
    - principle: "Focus on Sensory Impact: Describe how conditions look, sound, smell, feel."
    - principle: "Consider Dynamics: Plan for how states might evolve during the narrative."
    - principle: "Ensure Systemic Links: Show how different state categories influence each other."
  codex_link: "Ensure Global States Protocol clearly defines conditions for the relevant timeline, including sensory details and interconnections."

# --- IV. Designing Individuals Within the System ---
designing_individuals:
  core_principle: |
    Entities should feel like organic parts of their heterocosm, shaped by its context, 
    and possessing properties allowing meaningful interaction with its systems.
  key_design_questions:
    - question: "How do entity **authenticated properties** (skills, flaws, beliefs, etc.) logically **derive from or respond to** world history and current state?"
    - question: "What properties must entities possess to **interact meaningfully** with core conflicts, mysteries, or unique world systems (e.g., Chrono-Tech)?"
    - question: "How do characters' **internal conflicts/motivations mirror** larger world themes/tensions?"
    - question: "How can individual characters serve as **windows** onto specific world aspects (lore, norms)?"
    - question: "Are character capabilities/knowledge **consistent** with world modalities? How are exceptions authenticated?"
  actionable_design_principles:
    - principle: "Contextualize Characters: Root backstories, skills, beliefs firmly in the world's reality."
    - principle: "Design for Interaction: Give entities relevant properties for world challenges."
    - principle: "Reflect Macro in Micro: Use personal arcs to explore world themes."
    - principle: "Ensure Plausibility (Internal): Justify extraordinary abilities within world rules."
    - principle: "Utilize Sensory Profiles: Define how entities perceive and are perceived."
  codex_link: "Ensure Entity Profiles detail authenticated properties/relations, linking to world context."

# --- V. Leveraging Authentication for Narrative Effect ---
leveraging_authentication:
  core_principle: |
    Consciously manipulate the flow, reliability, and focus of textual authentication 
    to create specific narrative effects (suspense, mystery, irony, pacing).
  key_design_questions:
    - question: "What information should be **authenticated early** vs. **withheld** for maximum impact?"
    - question: "Can **unreliable narration** be used effectively? How is reliability signaled/undermined?"
    - question: "Where can **strategic ambiguity** (unauthenticated facts) create compelling mysteries?"
    - question: "How can **dramatic irony** be created via differential authentication (audience vs. character knowledge)?"
    - question: "How will selective authentication **focus audience attention** on key elements?"
  actionable_design_principles:
    - principle: "Map Information Flow: Plan world-building reveals alongside plot."
    - principle: "Control Perspective: Choose narrative voice/POV strategically for authentication effects."
    - principle: "Design Mysteries Intentionally: Know what you're leaving ambiguous and why."
    - principle: "Layer Authentication Sources: Use narration, dialogue, documents with varying authority."
    - principle: "Guide Focus: Use authoritative predication to emphasize importance."
  codex_link: "Note intended ambiguities, unreliable sources, or planned reveals in relevant Codex sections."

# --- VI. Designing for Audience Engagement ---
designing_for_engagement:
  core_principle: |
    Structure the world and its presentation to actively invite and reward audience 
    exploration, speculation, community interaction, and creative participation.
  key_design_questions:
    - question: "What **mysteries, contradictions, or unexplored areas** are embedded as hooks for speculation?"
    - question: "How will **attentive audiences be rewarded** (understanding clues, appreciating irony, payoffs)?"
    - question: "Does the world possess sufficient **complexity and consistency** for meaningful theorizing/wiki-building?"
    - question: "Are there **undersaturated areas** providing natural spaces for fan creativity?"
    - question: "If pursuing **transmedia**, how are elements strategically distributed for synergy and additive comprehension?"
  actionable_design_principles:

    - principle: "Plan Transmedia Purposefully: Design cross-platform elements for narrative synergy."
  codex_link: "List Core Mysteries, clue potential, transmedia hooks. Maintain via Canon Management policy."

# --- VII. The World Bible/Codex as Central Design Tool ---
world_bible_utility:
  core_principle: |
    The World Bible/Codex is the active repository of authenticated truths and the essential tool 
    for ensuring consistency and guiding design.
  key_design_questions:
    - question: "Is the Codex structured clearly distinguishing **authenticated facts** from notes/speculation?"
    - question: "Is there a clear process for **updating the Codex** with new authentications? Who has authority?"

  codex_link: "This protocol document itself is part of operationalizing the World Bible/Codex as a design tool."

# --- Conclusion ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    By consciously applying these principles, world-building moves towards **strategic narrative architecture**. 
    Intentional choices about authentication, structure, systemic interplay, and engagement create heterocosms 
    that are coherent, resonant, enduring, and invite deep audience investment.
