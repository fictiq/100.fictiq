# Story World Codex: Coherence & Resonance Design Protocol
# Version: 1.0 (Based on Doležel - Re-evaluating Originality)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex: [Your Name/Studio Name]
# World: [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol guides the evaluation and refinement of the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm, 
    emphasizing principles of **internal coherence, systemic richness, and thematic resonance** 
    alongside imaginative invention. Inspired by Doležel's framework, it encourages moving 
    beyond a sole focus on 'pure novelty' to value the creative achievement inherent in 
    building a well-structured, internally consistent, and meaningful fictional universe.
  focus: |
    Assess how world elements (even familiar ones) are synthesized into a unique system, 
    how structure supports themes, and how consistency contributes to overall power and believability.

# --- I. Assessing Originality: Premise vs. System ---
originality_assessment:
  purpose: |
    To distinguish between the novelty of core concepts and the originality of their 
    systemic integration and execution.
  
  core_concept_premise:
    description: "[Briefly restate the central 'hook', e.g., Chrono-Noir city under a shattered, time-altering moon.]"
    premise_novelty_assessment: "[Rate or describe: Highly Original / Familiar Genre Blend / Twist on Existing Trope / etc. e.g., Steampunk + Noir + Temporal Anomalies = Relatively unique blend.]"

  key_element_novelty:
    - element: "Chrono-Dust Mechanics"
      novelty_level: "[e.g., Specific mechanics (Dust shedding, Paradox risk) feel fairly original.]"
    - element: "Guild Structures"
      novelty_level: "[e.g., Guild trope is familiar, but specific functions (Memory Keepers) offer novelty.]"
    - element: "Clockwork Automatons"
      novelty_level: "[e.g., Familiar steampunk element.]"
    - element: "Temporal Aberrations"
      novelty_level: "[e.g., Concept of 'time monsters' has precedent, but specific manifestation ('glitches', 'splinters') aims for uniqueness.]"
    # - Add assessments for other key elements...

  systemic_synthesis_originality:
    assessment: |
      How original is the *way* these elements (novel or familiar) are **combined, interconnected, 
      and governed by internal rules** within *this specific* heterocosm? Does the overall 
      *system* feel unique and coherent?
    notes: |
      [e.g., The core originality lies in how unstable time (Moon/Dust/Aberrations) interacts 
      directly with the rigid clockwork society (Guilds/Automatons) and noir themes (memory/truth). 
      The *interplay* feels distinct.]
    action_items: |
      [e.g., Strengthen unique interactions between tech system and social structure; 
      ensure familiar tropes get a distinct 'Aethelgard spin' via specific properties/rules.]

  reflection_prompt: |
    Where does the true originality lie? Primarily in inventing new concepts, or in the unique 
    way concepts are structured, combined, and made internally consistent?

# --- II. Evaluating Internal Coherence & Consistency ---
coherence_evaluation:
  purpose: |
    To assess the logical and semantic integrity of the world, recognizing coherence 
    as a major creative achievement.

  consistency_areas:
    - area: "Governing Modalities (Physics/Magic/Tech Rules)"
      assessment: "[Are fundamental rules authenticated clearly and applied consistently? Are costs/limits respected?]"
      notes: "[e.g., Chrono-Tech limits seem consistent. Need to ensure plot devices adhere strictly.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Create quick-ref sheet for Chrono-Tech rules.]"
      
    - area: "Historical Causality"
      assessment: "[Does Present State logically follow from Authenticated History? Are causal links believable *within world logic*?]"
      notes: "[e.g., Guild rise post-Shattering logical. Undercity Collapse impact clear. First Paradox -> Policy link needs strengthening.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Add textual links (dialogue/docs) explicitly connecting First Paradox to current Chronometer caution.]"

    - area: "Character Properties & Actions"
      assessment: "[Do characters act plausibly given their authenticated properties and situation? Is development authenticated?]"
      notes: "[e.g., Kaelen's actions align with profile. Need to ensure Guild leader actions reflect their resources/limits.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Review political plot points against Guild power structures and character profiles.]"

    - area: "Terminology & Naming"
      assessment: "[Is world-specific terminology used consistently and defined clearly (implicitly/explicitly)?]"
      notes: "[e.g., Core terms consistent. Need to finalize Automaton classification names.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Add Automaton classification to relevant Codex section.]"

  reflection_prompt: |
    Where does the world feel most logically sound? Where do potential contradictions lurk? 
    How crucial is rigorous consistency for this world's believability/themes?

# --- III. Assessing Systemic Richness & Interconnection ---
systemic_richness_assessment:
  purpose: |
    To evaluate the complexity and integration of the world's elements, valuing the 
    creative work of building a dense, interconnected system.

  interconnection_areas:
    - area: "Technology <-> Society"
      assessment: "[How deeply/plausibly does Chrono-Tech influence social structure, daily life, politics, economics, culture?]"
      notes: "[e.g., Strong link via Guild control/Automatons. Could explore impact on art, philosophy more deeply.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Brainstorm cultural practices/art styles influenced by temporal instability/clockwork aesthetics.]"

    - area: "Environment <-> Inhabitants"
      assessment: "[How does the environment (Moon, Dust, decay) demonstrably shape inhabitants' biology, culture, tech, psychology?]"
      notes: "[e.g., Undercity adaptation clear. Surface obsession with order as reaction to chaos established. Physical adaptations could be explored further.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Consider adding specific authenticated physiological traits for long-term Undercity dwellers.]"

    - area: "History <-> Present Conflicts"
      assessment: "[Are present conflicts clearly/complexly rooted in specific authenticated historical events/legacies?]"
      notes: "[e.g., Guild tensions link to past. Shattering mystery central. Need to weave character backstories more deeply into specific historical moments.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Tie key character family histories directly to authenticated events like Undercity Collapse.]"

    - area: "Functional Detail Assessment"
      assessment: "[Do authenticated details serve purpose (narrative/thematic) or feel extraneous ('worldbuilder's disease')?]"
      notes: "[e.g., Most details functional. Clock repair complexity possibly extraneous unless linked. Sensory details serve atmosphere well.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Review minor artifacts list; ensure plot/theme relevance or cut/simplify.]"

  reflection_prompt: |
    Does the world feel like a complex ecosystem? Where could interconnections be deepened 
    or made more surprising? Is the detail level functional or overwhelming?

# --- IV. Evaluating Thematic Resonance Through Structure ---
thematic_resonance_evaluation:
  purpose: |
    To assess how the world's authenticated architecture (modalities, history, social structures) 
    inherently supports and explores the core themes.

  theme_analysis:
    - theme: "Memory & Identity"
      structural_support_assessment: "[How is theme embedded in world structure? e.g., Memory Keepers, amnesia prevalence, Automaton memory glitches, contested History, Temporal Sickness effects.]"
      strength: "[e.g., Very Strong. Structurally central.]"
      
    - theme: "Order vs. Chaos"
      structural_support_assessment: "[e.g., Guild/Council structure vs. Undercity; struggle against temporal instability/Aberrations; Clockwork vs. Decay aesthetic; Determinism ideology.]"
      strength: "[e.g., Strong. Central conflict reflected across layers.]"

    - theme: "Legacy & Consequence"
      structural_support_assessment: "[e.g., Shattering consequences; inherited statuses/conflicts; repair/salvage culture.]"
      strength: "[e.g., Moderate. Could be strengthened by linking more specific historical choices to specific present dilemmas.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Detail authenticated long-term consequences of First Paradox Event more clearly.]"

    # - Assess other core themes...

  reflection_prompt: |
    Does the world's fundamental design naturally generate questions/situations related to core themes? 
    Could the structure itself be interpreted as a statement? Where can structure be adjusted to enhance resonance?

# --- V. Synthesizing Familiar Elements Creatively ---
familiar_elements_synthesis:
  purpose: |
    To evaluate how familiar tropes/elements are recombined, modified, or integrated 
    within the world's unique system to create originality through synthesis.

  element_analysis:
    - element_trope: "Steampunk Automatons"
      unique_integration_twist: "[e.g., Linked to Chrono-Tech (memory loops, temporal glitches); central labor role creates specific social tensions; potential consciousness tied to memory themes; decay aesthetic.]"
      assessment: "[e.g., Well-integrated and given unique function/thematic weight.]"

    - element_trope: "Noir Detective"
      unique_integration_twist: "[e.g., Amnesia links to core Memory/Identity themes; investigation grapples with temporal anomalies/unreliable history; operates within unique Guild/Undercity politics.]"
      assessment: "[e.g., Classic trope effectively repurposed for specific world context.]"

    - element_trope: "Competing Guilds/Factions"
      unique_integration_twist: "[e.g., Power based specifically on Chrono-Dust/Temporal Tech aspects. Ideologies provide flavor.]"
      assessment: "[e.g., Integration functional but could enhance unique *philosophical* differences between Guilds.]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Develop more distinct axiological/epistemic stances for major Guilds.]"

    # - Assess other familiar elements...

  reflection_prompt: |
    Where does the world successfully synthesize familiar elements into something new/coherent? 
    Where might tropes feel generic? How can the world's unique *rules* and *history* further 
    transform familiar elements?

# --- Conclusion ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    This review emphasizes originality extending beyond novel concepts to include the creative 
    achievement of constructing a **coherent, richly interconnected, and thematically resonant system**.
  final_recommendation: |
    Assess the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm for the elegance, robustness, and internal logic 
    of its overall architecture. Focus refinement on strengthening **internal consistency**, 
    deepening **systemic interconnections**, and ensuring the world's **structure powerfully serves** 
    its narrative and thematic ambitions. A well-architected world provides enduring value.
