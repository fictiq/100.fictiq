# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides the **definitive operational framework** for all collaborative creative endeavors 
    within the Aethelgard heterocosm. Recognizing the profound challenges to coherence posed by 
    **distributed authenticating authority**, this document establishes rigorous principles, processes, 
    and governance structures inspired by Doležel's semantic theory. Its goal is to ensure the 
    **structural integrity, thematic unity, and canonical consistency** of the shared world across all 
    contributors, platforms, and timelines, facilitating **structured freedom** within a unified vision.
  scope: |
    Mandatory for all personnel involved in writing, designing, developing, editing, or approving 
    canonical content for Aethelgard, including internal teams, external partners, and licensees. 
    Supersedes individual project guidelines where conflicts arise regarding core canon.

# --- I. Central Authenticational Authority & Governance ---
central_authority_governance:
  purpose: "Define the structure, responsibilities, and decision-making processes of the ultimate arbiter of Aethelgard canon."
  
  designated_authority:
    name: "[e.g., Aethelgard Oversight Committee (AOC)]"
    composition: "[e.g., Lead World Architect, Lead Narrative Designer (Game), Showrunner (TV), Senior Editor (Publishing), Keeper of the Codex (non-voting secretary).]"
    mandate: "To preserve and guide the coherent evolution of the Aethelgard heterocosm according to the principles outlined in this Codex system."

  scope_of_authority_detailed:
    - area: "Core Canon Definition & Maintenance"
      responsibility: "Sole authority to define, modify, and ratify Tier 1 Canon elements (foundational modalities, core historical events, primary character arcs/fates, essential world states) documented in the Master Codex."
    - area: "Review & Approval of Significant New Authentications"
      responsibility: "Mandatory review and formal approval required for proposals introducing: new species/major factions, significant locations impacting world map/lore, novel applications of core tech/magic, major character introductions/deaths/transformations, substantial historical revelations, or any element potentially conflicting with Tier 1 Canon."
      process_ref: "See Section VI: Proposal & Authentication Process."
    - area: "Canon Conflict Resolution"
      responsibility: "Final arbiter in disputes regarding interpretation of existing canon or contradictions between different canonical/potentially canonical sources."
      process_ref: "See Section VII: Conflict Resolution & Appeals."
    - area: "Retcon Authorization & Management"
      responsibility: "Sole authority to approve necessary retcons, ensuring rigorous justification, minimal disruption, clear documentation, and consistent future application."
      process_ref: "See Section VIII: Retcon Policy."
    - area: "Tonal, Thematic, & Aesthetic Oversight"
      responsibility: "Maintain the overall integrity of Aethelgard's established Tone (Chrono-Noir/Hopeful Decay), core Themes (Memory, Order/Chaos, etc.), and defined Aesthetics across all manifestations."

  decision_making_protocols:
    core_canon_changes: "[e.g., Requires unanimous consent of voting AOC members after detailed impact assessment.]"
    new_authentication_approval: "[e.g., Requires majority AOC vote based on proposal review against Codex consistency and strategic goals.]"
    conflict_resolution: "[e.g., Keeper presents evidence, AOC deliberates, Lead Architect holds tie-breaking vote if necessary.]"
    meeting_frequency: "[e.g., Bi-weekly standard meetings, plus ad-hoc sessions for urgent proposals/conflicts.]"
    documentation: "All AOC decisions, justifications, and resulting Codex updates meticulously documented by the Keeper."

  rationale: |
    A clearly defined, empowered central authority with transparent processes is non-negotiable 
    for preventing semantic drift and maintaining the structural integrity required for a believable, 
    shared heterocosm across multiple creative voices. It embodies the unified 'Sovereign Authenticator' function.

# --- II. The World Bible/Codex: Supreme Canonical Repository & Operational Tool ---
world_codex_protocols:
  purpose: "Define the absolute centrality, structure, accessibility, and mandatory usage of the World Bible/Codex system."

  codex_status: "The **single, immutable source of truth** for all authenticated Aethelgard canon (Tiers 1 & 2). All other documents (scripts, design docs) are subordinate regarding established world facts/rules."
  
  format_structure:
    platform: "[e.g., Secure internal wiki database with robust search, version control, hyperlinking, and multimedia embedding capabilities.]"
    organization: "[e.g., Structured according to core protocols (Identity, Modality, History, States, Entities, Interplay, Sensory Palette, etc.), with granular entries for specific elements, tagged by canon tier and authentication source/date.]"
    key_features: "[e.g., Advanced search filters, visual timeline/map integration, character relationship tracker, automated inconsistency flagging (potential future feature), restricted editing logs.]"

  accessibility_permissions:
    read_access: "[e.g., Granted to all approved creative/production personnel via secure login.]"
    edit_access: "[e.g., Strictly limited to Keeper of the Codex and designated AOC members for ratifying approved changes.]"
    proposal_submission: "[e.g., Dedicated system/template for submitting proposed additions/changes for AOC review.]"

  mandatory_usage_policy:
    consultation_requirement: "**Mandatory** consultation of relevant Codex sections *prior* to drafting any scene, designing any asset, or writing any dialogue that touches upon established lore, rules, characters, history, or locations. Assumption of knowledge is insufficient."
    citation_requirement: "Proposals for new authentications or interpretations of existing canon *must* cite relevant Codex entries and justify consistency or necessary evolution."
    violation_consequence: "[e.g., Work failing to adhere to established Codex canon without prior AOC approval may require revision or rejection.]"

  update_maintenance_protocol:
    responsibility: "Keeper of the Codex, acting upon formal AOC decisions."
    frequency: "Continuous integration of approved changes; major version updates communicated quarterly."
    version_control: "Rigorous tracking of all changes, including justification, date, and authorizing body."

  rationale: |
    In collaborative creation, the Codex *is* the functional heterocosm blueprint. Its accuracy, accessibility, 
    and unquestioned authority as the single source of truth are paramount for preventing fragmentation 
    and enabling coherent co-creation, manifesting Doležel's principle of textually grounded reality.

# --- III. Contributor Creativity Guidelines (Structured Freedom Mandates) ---
contributor_guidelines:
  purpose: "Provide explicit rules of engagement for individual creators operating within the shared Aethelgard heterocosm, fostering creativity *through* disciplined adherence to the established framework."

  principles:
    - principle: "Canon Primacy & Due Diligence"
      mandate: "Authenticated Tier 1 & 2 canon documented in the Codex is **binding**. Creators *must* perform due diligence by consulting the Codex before authenticating potentially overlapping or conflicting information. Ignorance of canon is not a valid excuse for inconsistency."
      action: "Verify alignment with Codex *before* finalizing creative elements."

    - principle: "Modal Adherence: Respect the Laws"
      mandate: "All narrative events, character actions, and technological/magical functions must operate strictly **within the bounds of the world's established modalities** (Alethic, Deontic, Axiological, Epistemic) as defined in the Codex. Do not invent exceptions without formal approval."
      action: "Design solutions/actions that leverage or are constrained by existing rules. Propose rule modifications/exceptions via formal process (Section VI)."

    - principle: "Build Upon, Enhance, Integrate – Don't Contradict"
      mandate: "New contributions should aim to **enrich and deepen** the existing heterocosm, building logically upon established history, character arcs, and world states. Direct contradiction of established canon without formal retcon approval (Section VIII) is prohibited."
      action: "Frame new ideas as extensions, consequences, or deeper explorations of existing elements. Ensure new creations are *functionally integrated* (see Systemic Richness Protocol)."

    - principle: "Strategic Use of Undersaturation"
      mandate: "Respect areas intentionally left ambiguous or undefined (undersaturated) in the Codex. Focus creativity on elaborating defined areas or exploring the *implications* of authenticated elements. Do not arbitrarily define core mysteries unless specifically tasked and approved by the AOC."
      action: "Consult Codex/AOC regarding boundaries of undersaturated areas. Use ambiguity purposefully for narrative effect where appropriate."

    - principle: "Formal Proposal for Significant Authentications"
      mandate: "Any proposed authentication that significantly impacts core canon (new major entities/locations/rules, major historical reveals, character deaths, major shifts in world state) **requires formal submission and approval** through the defined AOC process (Section VI)."
      action: "Use the designated proposal template, clearly justifying the addition/change based on narrative need, thematic relevance, and consistency with existing canon."

    - principle: "Maintain Tonal & Thematic Cohesion"
      mandate: "Ensure new content aligns with Aethelgard's established **core identity, themes, and tone** (Chrono-Noir/Hopeful Decay) as defined in the Codex. Avoid jarring stylistic or thematic departures without explicit AOC discussion/approval."
      action: "Continuously reference Tone & Style Guides within the Codex during creation."

  rationale: |
    These mandates operationalize Doležel's concept of structured invention within a collaborative context. 
    They provide the 'rules of play' ensuring individual creativity contributes to, rather than fragments, 
    the shared heterocosm, fostering a balance between freedom and collective coherence.

# --- IV. Canon Hierarchy & Transmedia Consistency Management ---
transmedia_canon_management:
  purpose: "Establish clear rules of precedence and processes for ensuring canonical consistency across multiple media platforms."

  canon_tier_definition: # Must be explicitly defined and enforced
    - tier: 1 
      name: "Core Foundational Canon"
      sources: "[List SPECIFIC titles/series, e.g., 'Aethelgard Chronicles' TV Series (Seasons 1-X), 'Aethelgard: Undercity' Game (Main Storyline), 'Codex Initiates' Novel Trilogy.]"
      authority: "Establishes fundamental world rules, major historical events, primary character arcs/fates. Takes absolute precedence."
    - tier: 2
      name: "Expansive Canonical Content"
      sources: "[List specific types/series, e.g., Official Tie-in Comic Series ('Tales of the Guilds'), Secondary Game DLC ('Aberration Hunt'), Standalone Novels ('The Clockwork Heart'), Official Website Lore Database.]"
      authority: "Must be consistent with Tier 1. Enriches world, explores secondary characters/events. Details can be superseded by future Tier 1 content if necessary (requires AOC ratification)."
    - tier: 3
      name: "Referential / Flavor Canon"
      sources: "[List types, e.g., Art Books (design insights), TTRPG Sourcebooks (rule adaptations/suggestions), ARG narratives/clues (unless explicitly elevated by AOC), Developer Commentaries.]"
      authority: "Considered 'soft' canon. Offers context, inspiration, aesthetic guidance. Not binding on Tier 1/2 plot or rules unless explicitly referenced/authenticated within them."
    - tier: "Non-Canon"
      sources: "[Fan Fiction/Art/Theories, Marketing Materials, Early Drafts/Pitches, Non-sanctioned Interviews.]"
      authority: "Not part of the authenticated heterocosm."

  cross_platform_consistency_protocol:
    codex_integration: "All significant authentications (lore reveals, rule clarifications, character developments) from any Tier 1 or Tier 2 release MUST be integrated into the central World Bible/Codex promptly by the Keeper."
    inter_team_communication: "Mandatory regular meetings/updates facilitated by Keeper/AOC involving leads from all active platform teams to ensure awareness of developments and prevent cross-media contradictions."
    shared_asset_library: "[e.g., Maintain central library for approved character models, location designs, sound effects, terminology guides to ensure aesthetic/sensory consistency.]"
    review_process: "Scripts/designs/builds for one platform that reference or impact elements established on another platform require specific cross-check against Codex and potentially review by relevant team leads/AOC."

  rationale: |
    A clearly defined hierarchy and rigorous cross-platform communication protocol are essential 
    for maintaining a single, coherent Aethelgard heterocosm across diverse media, preventing 
    fragmentation and rewarding audience engagement across the ecosystem.

# --- V. Retcon Policy & Canon Evolution Management ---
retcon_policy:
  purpose: "Establish a highly restrictive but defined process for managing necessary changes to previously authenticated canon, prioritizing world integrity."

  guiding_principle: "Retcons are **extraordinary measures**, undertaken only to resolve critical structural inconsistencies or enable essential future narratives unobtainable otherwise. Consistency and respecting prior authentication is the default."
  
  approval_process:
    - "Requires formal proposal to AOC detailing the contradiction/narrative necessity."
    - "Requires thorough impact assessment documenting all affected canon elements."
    - "Requires **super-majority or unanimous AOC approval**."
    - "Requires exploration of *all possible alternatives* within existing canon first."

  implementation_guidelines:
    - "Prefer **recontextualization over outright contradiction** where possible (e.g., revealing prior information was incomplete/misinterpreted based on newly authenticated facts)."
    - "Aim for **minimal narrative disruption**."
    - "Provide **clear in-world justification** if feasible (e.g., discovery of new evidence, revelation of manipulation, authenticated effects of temporal distortion)."
    - "**Document the retcon meticulously** in the Codex, including justification, date, approval, and clear guidelines on which version is now authoritative."
    - "**Communicate the change clearly** to all relevant creative teams."

  transparency_policy: "[e.g., Generally avoid announcing retcons publicly unless absolutely necessary for audience comprehension of ongoing narratives. Prioritize smooth integration over highlighting changes.]"

  rationale: |
    Protecting the authenticated past is crucial for audience trust and the world's autonomy. 
    This restrictive policy ensures that changes are deliberate, justified, centrally controlled, 
    and consistently managed, preserving the heterocosm's structural integrity as much as possible.

# --- VI. Collaborative Environment & Communication Protocols ---
collaboration_protocols:
  purpose: "Foster a productive, respectful collaborative environment grounded in shared understanding and commitment to the world's integrity."

  communication_channels: "[e.g., Dedicated Slack/Discord channels for lore questions/discussions (moderated by Keeper); Regular cross-team video conferences; Centralized task management system for proposals/reviews.]"
  feedback_culture: "Encourage constructive feedback focused on **Codex consistency, thematic alignment, and structural integrity**. Frame critiques with reference to established canon/protocols. Personal attacks or purely subjective taste critiques discouraged."
  credit_attribution: "[e.g., Establish clear guidelines for crediting major world-building contributions (e.g., new species design, key historical event conception) in Codex acknowledgements or project credits.]"
  shared_vision_reinforcement: "[e.g., Regular circulation of core identity documents; Kick-off meetings for new projects reinforcing world vision/tone; Use of shared visual mood boards.]"
  conflict_resolution_process: "[Refer to Section VII: Conflict Resolution & Appeals.]" # Link to potential future section

  rationale: "A structured, respectful communication culture focused on the shared goal of building the best, most coherent version of Aethelgard is vital for harnessing collective creativity effectively."

# --- VII. Conflict Resolution & Appeals Process ---
# (Placeholder - Requires detailed definition based on organizational structure)
conflict_resolution_appeals:
  purpose: "Define a clear process for resolving disagreements regarding canon interpretation, proposed changes, or AOC decisions."
  process_outline: "[e.g., Initial discussion with Keeper/Team Lead -> Formal written appeal to AOC with supporting evidence from Codex -> AOC review and final binding decision -> Documentation of decision.]"
  principles: "[e.g., Decisions based on Codex evidence and established protocols; Respectful hearing of all viewpoints; Timely resolution.]"

# --- VIII. Conclusion: Collective Guardianship of the Heterocosm ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    This protocol establishes the framework for the **collective guardianship** of the Aethelgard heterocosm. 
    By centralizing authenticating authority, mandating rigorous use of the World Codex, guiding contributor 
    creativity within established structures, managing transmedia consistency, controlling canon evolution, 
    and fostering structured collaboration, we aim to achieve a shared universe that exemplifies Doležel's 
    principles of **internal coherence, systemic richness, and resonant meaning**.
  final_statement: |
    Successful collaborative world-building requires discipline equal to its imagination. Adherence to this 
    protocol ensures that the many hands shaping Aethelgard contribute to a single, unified, and enduring 
    **architecture of meaning**, preserving its integrity for creators and audiences alike across all its manifestations.

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Collaboration:

Formal Governance: Section I defines a specific governing body (AOC) with detailed responsibilities and decision-making protocols, moving beyond vague "authority."

Codex as Operational System: Section II details the platform, structure, access levels, mandatory usage, and update protocols for the Codex, treating it as a critical piece of infrastructure.

Mandates, Not Just Guidelines: Section III uses stronger language ("mandate," "prohibited," "requires formal submission") to establish clear rules of engagement for contributors.

Explicit Canon Hierarchy: Section IV demands listing specific source types for each canon tier, leaving less room for ambiguity. It also mandates specific processes for cross-platform consistency.

Rigorous Retcon Policy: Section V establishes a multi-step approval process and justification requirements, making retcons difficult and deliberate.

Defined Collaboration Structures: Section VI outlines specific communication channels and feedback principles.

Formal Conflict Resolution: Section VII introduces the necessity of a defined appeals process.

Theoretical Grounding: Continuously links practical procedures back to Doležel's theoretical principles (authentication, coherence, heterocosm integrity) in the rationale fields.

This extremely detailed YAML provides a comprehensive governance and operational framework designed for complex, multi-creator environments, ensuring that the collaborative construction of Aethelgard remains disciplined, coherent, and true to its core vision, reflecting the rigorous demands of maintaining a unified heterocosm as conceptualized by Doležel.
