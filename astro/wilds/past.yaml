# Story World Codex: Entity Historical Properties Protocol
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Imbuing Entities with Past)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly granular framework** for the meticulous definition 
    and strategic deployment of **Historical Properties** assigned to entities within the Aethelgard 
    heterocosm. Building upon Doležel's theory, it focuses on how the **authenticated past** is 
    **constitutively embedded** within present entities (persons, objects, places, factions, etc.) 
    through explicit predication, shaping their identity, function, motivations, and narrative potential.
  scope: |
    Mandatory template for defining the historical constitution of all significant canonical entities. 
    Ensures backstory is not mere exposition but an **integral, authenticated component** of the entity's 
    present being, deeply woven into the world's established timeline and causal network. Demands rigorous 
    authentication and exploration of consequences.
  ontological_premise: |
    An entity's past, within the Aethelgard heterocosm, exists **only** as authenticated through narrative 
    discourse and codified herein. Historical properties are **constitutive attributes**, defining the entity's 
    temporal dimension and linking it inextricably to the validated history of its world. Undefined past 
    aspects **do not exist** for the entity within the canonical framework.

      (HIST_ORIGIN), explicitly mandated by the **Founding Compact** (HIST_ASSOC) to preserve knowledge. However, 
      its **authenticated control over fragmented and potentially unreliable records** (HIST_ASSOC/EPISTEMIC), coupled 
      with **rumored past actions of suppression** (HIST_EXP - contested), positions it as a powerful, ambiguous 
      force whose present actions are deeply intertwined with the **world's central epistemic and historical mysteries**. 
      Its identity *is* its relationship to the contested past."]

# --- End of Entity Historical Profile ---


How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Historical Properties:

Granular Categories: Breaks down History into Origin/Creation, Lineage/Heritage, Past Experiences/Actions, Possession/Association, and Change/Continuity, demanding comprehensive consideration.

Explicit Authentication & Sourcing: Requires citing authentication sources for each historical property, reinforcing textual grounding.

Focus on Consequences/Legacy: Explicitly links past events/experiences to resulting present properties (physical, psychological, social, functional), emphasizing history's active influence.

Distinction Between Fact & Belief: Differentiates between objectively authenticated history and authenticated beliefs or legends about history (e.g., Artificer Vance's status).

Integration with Other Properties: Shows how Historical properties directly influence or are reflected in Physical (scars), Psychological (trauma, memory), Social (lineage, status), Functional (skills from experience), and Modal (inherited obligations/curses) properties.

Deep Prompts for Nuance: Includes highly specific prompts pushing consideration of causal links, sensory legacies, conflicting accounts, thematic functions, and strategic undersaturation related to history.

Rigorous Synthesis: The summary demands articulating the entity's core identity as defined by its authenticated past and analyzing its function within the world's temporal network.

Event/Figure Linking: Encourages linking properties directly to specific HIST_Event_ID or HIST_Figure_ID entries defined elsewhere in the Codex for strong cross-referencing.

This extremely detailed YAML template provides a robust framework for meticulously constructing the historical dimension of entities within Aethelgard, ensuring their pasts are not just backstory but are deeply woven, authenticated components of their present being, driving narrative and enriching the heterocosm's temporal depth.
