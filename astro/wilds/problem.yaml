# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol addresses the **inherent risks to internal coherence** posed by **distributed authentication** 
    in collaborative world-building for Aethelgard. Inspired by Doležel's framework, which highlights consistency 
    as crucial for heterocosmic integrity, this document provides a structured approach to **proactively 
    identifying and mitigating** potential contradictions arising from multiple creators authenticating 
    facts, rules, history, and character elements.
  focus: |
    To safeguard the shared heterocosm's integrity, preserve audience trust, and ensure the effectiveness 
    of shared narrative development by implementing robust preventative and corrective measures against incoherence.

# --- I. Risk Area: Contradictory Factual Authentications ---
risk_area_factual_contradictions:
  problem_description: |
    High risk of different contributors authenticating directly conflicting 'facts' about the same 
    entity (status, properties, location), event (timing, outcome, participants), or location 
    (layout, features, status) due to oversight, miscommunication, differing interpretations, 
    or disregard for established canon across multiple creative outputs (scripts, designs, code, prose). 
    Accumulation erodes believability.
  
  potential_manifestations_detailed:
    - "Character Status Conflicts: Character A authenticated dead in Comic X, simultaneously alive in Game Y storyline without resurrection being authenticated/explained."
    - "Simultaneity Paradox: Character B authenticated in Location Alpha (TV Show Ep 5) AND Location Beta (Concurrent Tie-in Novel Ch 3) at the exact same heterocosmic time without authenticated teleportation/cloning."
    - "Object Property Conflicts: Artifact 'Omega Key' authenticated as requiring 'Dust Fuel' (Game A) but depicted functioning without fuel (Film B); Material composition described differently by different artists/writers."
    - "Location Layout Inconsistency: Map of 'Grand Orrery District' used by game team differs significantly from description/depiction in core TV series, creating spatial paradoxes."
    - "Event Outcome Discrepancy: 'Guild Skirmish of '10' outcome described as decisive Gearwright victory (Codex History) but referenced as indecisive stalemate (Dialogue in later Comic Arc)."
    - "Timeline/Date Errors: Foundational Compact dated Year 50 AR in Codex, but referenced as Year 60 AR in a supplementary lore entry."
    - "Attribute Accumulation Failure: Minor details (eye color, specific scar, known allergy) authenticated early are forgotten/contradicted in later appearances across different media."

  mitigation_strategies_detailed:
    - strategy_id: "FACT_MIT_01"
      name: "Mandatory Pre-Authentication Codex Check"
      status: "[Implemented / Partially Implemented / Needs Implementation]"
      procedure: |
        **Non-negotiable protocol:** Before ANY authentication of a state, property, location, or status for an *existing* canonical entity/event, the responsible creator MUST consult the definitive entry in the central World Bible/Codex. Check must verify: Current Status, Core Properties, Established History/Timeline Placement, Key Relationships. Verification step must be logged in production tracking.
      enforcement: "Review process flags unverified authentications; may require revision."

    - strategy_id: "FACT_MIT_02"
      name: "Centralized Dynamic Entity & State Tracker"
      status: "[Needs Development / Basic Implementation Exists]"
      procedure: |
        Maintain a dedicated, easily queryable database/section within the Codex tracking the **current canonical state** (Location, Condition [Alive/Dead/Damaged/Lost], Key Possessions, Faction Allegiance, Significant Recent Events) for ALL major recurring characters, organizations, artifacts, and potentially key locations. Updated *immediately* upon ratification of new Tier 1/2 canon events affecting state.
      enforcement: "Tracker serves as primary reference for status checks (FACT_MIT_01)."

    - strategy_id: "FACT_MIT_03"
      name: "Proactive Cross-Team Communication Channels"
      status: "[Implemented / Needs Improvement / Needs Formalization]"
      procedure: |
        Establish dedicated channels (e.g., '#canon_consistency_check' Slack, regular cross-project sync meetings focused *specifically* on potential overlaps/conflicts) monitored actively by Keeper/Story Group. Encourage creators to flag potential issues *early* in development ("Planning to depict Character X in Undercity during Week Y - does this conflict with Game Team plans?").
      enforcement: "Mandatory reporting of major character/location usage across teams to Keeper."

    - strategy_id: "FACT_MIT_04"
      name: "Rigorous Codex Version Control & Update Discipline"
      status: "[Implemented]"
      procedure: "Strict Git-like version control for Codex database/files. All changes logged with justification, authorizer, date. Clear communication protocol for major updates ensures all teams are using the latest canonical baseline."
      enforcement: "Automated checks/reminders for outdated local copies where feasible."

    - strategy_id: "FACT_MIT_05"
      name: "Multi-Stage Consistency Review Process"
      status: "[Needs Formalization / Partially Implemented]"
      procedure: |
        Implement consistency checks at multiple stages: Outline review, Script/Design Doc review, Asset review, Final Build/Edit review. Checklists specifically target factual consistency against Codex tracker and established properties. Requires dedicated lore/continuity reviewers integrated into production pipelines.
      enforcement: "Sign-off from lore reviewer required for progression."

  risk_assessment_prompt: |
    Where is factual leakage most likely? Across different media types (game vs. film)? Between concurrent storylines? For long-absent characters/elements? With frequently revised entities? How can the state tracker (FACT_MIT_02) be optimized for real-time accuracy?

# --- II. Risk Area: Modal Instability ('Rule Drift') ---
risk_area_modal_instability:
  problem_description: |
    High risk of inconsistent interpretation and application of the heterocosm's fundamental 
    governing laws (modalities: alethic, deontic, axiological, epistemic) by different contributors, 
    leading to a world whose internal logic feels unstable, arbitrary, or dependent on plot convenience. 
    This severely undermines world autonomy and believability.

  potential_manifestations_detailed:
    - "Alethic Drift (Physics/Magic/Tech): Magic suddenly becomes easier/less costly for a specific character/scene; Technology performs feats previously established as impossible without justification; Paradox consequences conveniently ignored; Established physical laws bent for visual spectacle."
    - "Deontic Drift (Ethics/Laws): Severity of punishment for breaking a specific law varies wildly depending on the protagonist/plot; Characters ignore core tenets of their established ethical code without consequence or adequate internal conflict; Societal taboos enforced inconsistently."
    - "Axiological Drift (Values): Narrative suddenly celebrates a value (e.g., ruthless ambition) previously established as negative within the world's system, without exploring the contradiction; Thematic weight shifts incoherently between installments."
    - "Epistemic Drift (Knowledge): Characters gain access to forbidden/lost knowledge too easily, violating established limits; Sources previously established as unreliable suddenly provide accurate exposition without explanation; The difficulty of investigation fluctuates based purely on plot need."

  mitigation_strategies_detailed:
    - strategy_id: "MODAL_MIT_01"
      name: "Explicit & Granular Modality Codification"
      status: "[Partially Implemented / Needs Explicit Detail & Examples]"
      procedure: |
        Codex MUST contain dedicated sections for EACH modality. **Alethic:** Detail specific limits, costs, paradox triggers, energy requirements for ALL core magic/tech systems. **Deontic:** Document specific laws, codes, expected consequences (formal & social) for violations within key factions/locations. **Axiological:** Define core value hierarchies, virtues, vices, taboos for dominant cultures/factions. **Epistemic:** Detail known limits of knowledge, reliability tiers for info sources, mechanisms of info control/flow. Use concrete examples.
      enforcement: "Codex modality sections are binding for all narrative/gameplay mechanics."

    - strategy_id: "MODAL_MIT_02"
      name: "Mandatory 'Rules Compliance' Justification"
      status: "[Needs Implementation as Guideline]"
      procedure: |
        In proposals/scripts/design docs depicting significant use of world rules (complex magic, major tech feat, ethical dilemma resolution, key investigation), creators MUST briefly annotate *how* the depiction complies with relevant authenticated modalities in the Codex. Flags areas needing closer review.
      enforcement: "Review process checks these justifications for validity against Codex."

    - strategy_id: "MODAL_MIT_03"
      name: "Canonical Precedent Library & Edge Case Rulings"
      status: "[Needs Development]"
      procedure: |
        Keeper/AOC maintains a searchable library of canonical examples demonstrating correct application of complex rules in specific situations. AOC proactively issues rulings on ambiguous edge cases or potential loopholes to ensure consistent future application across teams.
      enforcement: "Library/Rulings integrated into Codex and serve as binding interpretations."

    - strategy_id: "MODAL_MIT_04"
      name: "Targeted Modality Workshops & Training"
      status: "[Needs Implementation]"
      procedure: |
        Regular workshops for creative teams focusing on specific complex modalities (e.g., "Understanding Paradox Mechanics," "Navigating Guild Ethics"). Use canonical examples and Q&A to ensure shared understanding and consistent application. Mandatory for new team members.
      enforcement: "Participation logged; understanding assessed informally."

    - strategy_id: "MODAL_MIT_05"
      name: "AOC Review of Significant Rule Applications/Interpretations"
      status: "[Implemented (Implicitly) / Needs Formal Trigger Points]"
      procedure: |
        Define clear trigger points (e.g., character death/resurrection, use of legendary artifact, event potentially causing paradox, major legal trial outcome) that automatically require AOC review and sign-off to ensure modal consistency before proceeding.
      enforcement: "Production milestones gated by relevant AOC approvals."

  risk_assessment_prompt: |
    Which specific rules in Aethelgard are most prone to misinterpretation or convenient bending (e.g., exact cost of temporal stasis, definition of 'unauthorized' Archive access, reliability threshold for Undercity rumors)? How can the Codex provide *unambiguous* guidance on these?

# --- III. Risk Area: Historical Fragmentation & Retcon Chaos ---
risk_area_historical_incoherence:
  problem_description: |
    Extreme difficulty in maintaining a coherent, consistent historical timeline, causality, 
    and established lore across potentially decades of contributions, numerous creators, 
    and multiple media, leading to contradictions, paradoxes, ignored history, and disruptive retcons.

  potential_manifestations_detailed:
    - "Timeline Contradictions: Event A established before Event B, later depicted happening after B."
    - "Causality Errors: Present state clearly contradicts the necessary outcome of a major authenticated past event."
    - "Origin Conflicts: Character/Faction/Tech origins retconned multiple times with conflicting details."
    - "Ignored History: Major past traumas/achievements seemingly forgotten by characters/society in later stories."
    - "Plot-Driven Retcons: Established history changed solely to enable a new story, invalidating previous narratives."
    - "Character Age/Timeline Paradoxes: Characters appearing too old/young relative to established dates/events."

  mitigation_strategies_detailed:
    - strategy_id: "HIST_MIT_01"
      name: "Definitive, Granular Master Timeline Database"
      status: "[Implemented / Needs Granular Detail & Integration]"
      procedure: |
        Maintain a **database-driven** timeline within the Codex, not just a list. Each entry includes: Authenticated Date (absolute or relative), Event Name, Core Facts, Key Participants/Locations, Immediate Consequences, Authentication Source(s), Canon Tier. Must be searchable/filterable. Visual representation highly recommended. **This is the absolute chronological authority.**
      enforcement: "All narrative timelines MUST align with this Master Timeline."

    - strategy_id: "HIST_MIT_02"
      name: "Explicit Historical Consequence Mapping"
      status: "[Needs Development]"
      procedure: |
        Codex entries for key historical events MUST include a dedicated section outlining their **authenticated long-term consequences** on specific Global States (Political, Social, Economic, Environmental), Technologies, Factions, or even generational Character Traits, ensuring legacy is actively tracked and integrated.
      enforcement: "New narratives set post-event must reflect these documented consequences."

    - strategy_id: "HIST_MIT_03"
      name: "Ultra-Restrictive Retcon Protocol & Impact Assessment"
      status: "[Implemented (See Section V in Collab Protocol)]"
      procedure: |
        Enforce the established strict protocol. **Mandatory Impact Assessment** for any proposed retcon MUST detail every previously authenticated fact, character arc, narrative event, and thematic point potentially invalidated or altered by the change, across ALL media. Approval requires demonstrating minimal disruption and overwhelming narrative necessity.
      enforcement: "Retcons without AOC approval are non-canonical."

    - strategy_id: "HIST_MIT_04"
      name: "Mandatory 'Historical Consistency Pass' in Review"
      status: "[Needs Formalization]"
      procedure: |
        Implement an explicit review stage for all outlines, scripts, and builds focused *solely* on checking alignment with the Master Timeline and authenticated historical facts/consequences, performed by designated lore experts/Keeper.
      enforcement: "Sign-off required before proceeding."

    - strategy_id: "HIST_MIT_05"
      name: "Canonization of Historical Interpretation (Epistemic Layer)"
      status: "[Implemented (Conceptually) / Needs Explicit Documentation]"
      procedure: |
        Codex explicitly distinguishes between **authenticated objective historical facts** and **authenticated in-world interpretations, beliefs, or propaganda** about those facts (which may be biased/false). This allows narratives to explore unreliable history without contradicting core canon. Document *both* layers clearly.
      enforcement: "Narratives must respect the distinction; exploring differing interpretations is encouraged, contradicting objective facts requires retcon process."

  risk_assessment_prompt: |
    Which eras or events in Aethelgard's history are most complex or have received contributions from the most diverse sources, making them highest risk for contradiction? How can the Master Timeline (HIST_MIT_01) be made more robust and easily accessible/cross-referenced by all creators?

# --- IV. Risk Area: Character Inconsistency ('Character Assassination') ---
# (Keeping this section concise as it overlaps heavily with previous descriptions, focusing on amplification)
risk_area_character_inconsistency:
  problem_description: "Amplified risk of established characters acting inconsistently regarding core personality, motivations, abilities, relationships, or voice when handled by multiple creators across different contexts, damaging audience connection and verisimilitude."
  potential_manifestations_amplified: "Contradictory actions within the *same timeframe* across different media; established weaknesses ignored for heroic moments; complex motivations simplified/flattened; unique voice lost entirely."
  mitigation_strategies_reinforced:
    - "Ultra-Detailed Character Bibles in Codex (including voice guide, core motivations, established limits, relationship maps)."
    - "Formal Character Arc Tracking & Approval by AOC for major developments."
    - "Designated 'Character Guardians' (Lead Writers/Creators) for key figures overseeing portrayal across platforms."
    - "Performance Consistency Checks (Voice Acting, Animation Models, Actor Portrayals) against established profiles."
  risk_assessment_prompt: "Which characters cross over most frequently between different media or creative teams? Do their Codex entries provide truly *unambiguous* guidance on their core, non-negotiable traits vs. areas open for interpretation/development?"

# --- V. Risk Area: Tonal & Thematic Dissonance (Franchise Identity Crisis) ---
# (Concise focus on amplification)
risk_area_tonal_thematic_dissonance:
  problem_description: "Increased potential for jarring shifts in tone (e.g., grimdark vs. slapstick) or conflicting thematic messages across different parts of the franchise, fragmenting the world's identity and confusing audience expectations."
  potential_manifestations_amplified: "Different platforms adopting radically different aesthetics for the 'same' world; storylines actively undermining themes central to other parts of the franchise; marketing misrepresenting core tone."
  mitigation_strategies_reinforced:
    - "Explicit Codification of Core Identity (Tone, Themes, Aesthetics) with detailed examples and anti-examples."
    - "Mandatory Project-Specific Tone/Theme Briefs approved by AOC, defining how each project fits within the whole."
    - "Cross-Platform Style Guides (Visual, Auditory) enforced by central art/sound direction."
    - "Thematic Consistency Review by AOC for all major narrative proposals."
  risk_assessment_prompt: "Where is the biggest risk for tonal clash based on planned projects across different platforms or targeting different demographics? How can the core 'Aethelgard feel' be preserved while allowing for variation?"

# --- VI. Risk Area: Systemic Fragmentation ('World Salad') ---
# (Concise focus on amplification)
risk_area_systemic_fragmentation:
  problem_description: "Increased tendency for new elements (lore, characters, locations, mechanics) introduced by different teams/projects to remain isolated ('canon fodder') rather than integrating meaningfully into the existing heterocosmic system, leading to bloat and incoherence."
  potential_manifestations_amplified: "Vast amounts of lore with little narrative impact; multiple similar factions/tech fulfilling redundant roles; plotlines resolved by newly introduced elements that ignore established world systems."
  mitigation_strategies_reinforced:
    - "Mandatory 'Systemic Impact & Integration' section in all new element proposals reviewed by AOC."
    - "Prioritize proposals that *build upon* or *interact with* existing systems over purely additive novelties."
    - "Regular 'System Health Audits' by Keeper/AOC to identify and integrate (or prune) poorly connected elements."
    - "Encourage narrative structures that force interaction between different world sub-systems."
  risk_assessment_prompt: "Which parts of the Aethelgard Codex feel most 'bloated' or contain elements rarely utilized by current narratives? How can new contributions be designed to explicitly connect to and utilize *existing* underdeveloped systems?"

# --- Conclusion: Collective Vigilance for a Coherent Heterocosm ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    This protocol underscores that the **distributed authentication** inherent in collaborative and transmedia 
    creation poses an **exponential risk to heterocosmic coherence**. Maintaining the structural integrity, 
    believability, and immersive potential of Aethelgard demands **extraordinary vigilance, rigorous processes, 
    and unwavering commitment** from all contributors.
  final_statement: |
    The mitigation strategies outlined here – rooted in **centralized authority, an authoritative Codex, clear protocols, 
    and a shared commitment to internal logic** – are not bureaucratic obstacles but **essential safeguards**. 
    They are the necessary architecture enabling multiple imaginations to collectively build and sustain a single, 
    unified, and resonant semantic universe, fulfilling the promise of a truly shared world grounded in Doležel's 
    principles of coherent textual construction. Failure to address these amplified risks inevitably leads to 
    fragmentation and the erosion of the world's core reality.

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for This Section:

Problem Definition Granularity: The problem_description under each risk area goes into more detail about the why and how of the incoherence specific to collaborative contexts.

Exhaustive Manifestations: Lists numerous specific, concrete examples of how each type of inconsistency might actually appear across different media or contributions.

Detailed Mitigation Procedures: The procedure under each mitigation strategy is more prescriptive and detailed, outlining specific actions, tools, and responsibilities (e.g., database structure, review checklists, specific communication protocols).

Status Tracking Integration: Includes status fields, emphasizing this as an operational document for tracking implementation.

Emphasis on Process & Enforcement: Highlights the need for formalized processes (logging checks, mandatory reviews, impact assessments, approval triggers) and mechanisms for enforcement.

Deep Interrogation via Prompts: The prompts are more demanding, asking for identification of specific high-risk areas within Aethelgard and pushing for optimization of mitigation strategies.

Reinforced Theoretical Links: Explicitly connects the practical problems and solutions back to the core Doležel concepts being challenged or adapted (authentication authority, heterocosm integrity, textual validation).

Concise Sections for Character/Tone/System: While detailed in other areas, it keeps the sections on Character, Tone, and Systemic Fragmentation more concise here, assuming those risks are well-understood from previous discussions but acknowledging their amplification in collaborative settings and reinforcing the core mitigation strategies.

This extremely detailed YAML serves as a comprehensive operational manual for anticipating and counteracting the significant challenges to coherence inherent in building a large-scale, collaborative story world like Aethelgard, ensuring its structural integrity remains paramount.
