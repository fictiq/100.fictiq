# Story World Codex: Final Entity Synthesis & Richness Review Protocol
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Rich Palette Conclusion)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly detailed framework** for the **final synthesis and critical evaluation** 
    of key entities within the Aethelgard heterocosm. It serves as the capstone reflection following the detailed 
    taxonomic definition of entity properties (Physical, Functional, Psychological, Social, Modal, Axiological, 
    Historical). Inspired by Doležel's conclusion on the **'Rich Palette of Fictional Being'**, this protocol 
    assesses the **holistic success** of entity constitution, focusing on how the **integration of diverse, 
    authenticated properties** creates multifaceted complexity, perceived depth, and functional coherence 
    within the bounds of textual reality.
  scope: |
    Mandatory final review step for all significant canonical entities (major characters, key locations/objects/
    creatures/factions) before locking their core definition in the Master Codex. Ensures entities are not merely 
    collections of attributes but function as **integrated semantic constructs**, validating the expressive 
    power of the linguistic architecture employed.
  ontological_premise: |
    Reaffirms Doležel's principle: The entity **IS** its complete bundle of authenticated properties and relations. 
    Perceived 'depth' or 'roundness' emerges entirely from the **richness, diversity, internal consistency, 
    potential conflicts, and systemic integration** of this textually defined bundle, interacting with strategic 
    undersaturation, NOT from any assumed non-textual substance or direct analogy to Actual World complexity.

        integration_into_world_network: "[Assess quality: e.g., Entity's role, status, and key relationships are clearly defined and actively shape its interactions and possibilities; OR Social context feels generic or underdeveloped; OR Exists largely in isolation.]"
        contribution_to_whole: "[e.g., Social position is major source of conflict/opportunity; Affiliations dictate plot trajectory.]"
      - dimension: "Modal Properties"
        presence_assessment: "[Rate: Defined / Not Applicable / Ambiguous]" # N/A if no UNIQUE modal properties
        clarity_impact_of_exception: "[Assess quality: e.g., Unique modal status (e.g., immortality) is clearly defined, consistently applied, and has significant narrative consequences; OR Modal status feels like ad-hoc plot device.]"

        presence_assessment: "[Rate: Extensively Defined / Adequately Defined / Minimally Defined / N/A]"
        depth_integration_of_past: "[Assess quality: e.g., Authenticated origins and past experiences provide deep context and motivation for present actions; OR Backstory feels generic or disconnected from current entity state.]"
        contribution_to_whole: "[e.g., Historical properties are source of core mysteries or character flaws/strengths.]"

    overall_multifacetedness_rating: "[Rate: Exceptionally Rich & Balanced / Adequately Multifaceted / Dominated by Few Dimensions / Critically Underdeveloped]"
    justification: "[Explain the rating based on the presence, depth, and balance across property dimensions relative to the entity's intended role and complexity.]"
    refinement_needed: "[Identify specific property categories requiring further authentication or deeper development to achieve intended complexity.]"
    prompts:
      - "Does the entity feel 'thin' in any crucial dimension (e.g., psychologically shallow, functionally vague, socially adrift)?"
      - "Which property category contributes MOST to its unique identity? Which contributes least?"

  # --- II. Evaluation of Internal Coherence & Bundle Integration ---
  internal_coherence_evaluation:
    purpose: "Assess the logical compatibility and harmonious integration of the diverse properties *within* the entity's authenticated bundle."

    consistency_across_properties:
      assessment_question: "Do the authenticated properties from different categories logically cohere or create believable tensions according to Aethelgard's rules? (e.g., Does physical strength match functional capability? Does psychological motivation align with social obligations? Does historical trauma explain present flaws?)"
      evidence_check: "[Cross-reference properties from different categories listed in the entity's detailed profile. Identify points of strong synergy and potential conflict.]"
      assessment: "[Rate: Highly Coherent Integration / Generally Coherent / Some Minor Tensions / Significant Internal Contradictions]"
      detailed_critique: "[e.g., Kaelen's physical limits cohere well with his reliance on functional deduction skills. Tension between his authenticated cynicism (Psych) and need to uphold Watch duty (Deontic/Social) is coherently portrayed as internal conflict. The high cost of magic (Functional/Alethic) aligns with the world's scarcity theme reflected in environment (Physical/State).]"
      action_items: "[e.g., Clarify how Character Y's authenticated extreme pacifism (Psych/Axio) coexists with their authenticated role as head of security (Social/Functional) - needs explicit justification or revision.]"

    resolution_of_internal_conflicts:
      assessment_question: "Where internal tensions *are* authenticated within the bundle (e.g., conflicting traits, desires vs. duties), are these conflicts portrayed as sources of character depth and narrative dynamism, rather than as logical inconsistencies?"
      assessment: "[e.g., Yes, Kaelen's internal conflicts drive his character arc. Ticker's conflicting data/directives fuels its potential emergence narrative.]"
      action_items: "[N/A - Internal conflict used effectively.]"

    adherence_to_modalities_as_integrator:
      assessment_question: "Does the entity's entire property bundle operate consistently within the overarching **governing modalities** of Aethelgard?"
      assessment: "[e.g., Yes, all authenticated properties respect the established limits of possibility (Alethic), obligation (Deontic), value (Axiological), and knowledge (Epistemic) for this world.]"
      action_items: "[N/A]"

    overall_bundle_integrity: "[Rate: Robust & Integrated / Generally Sound / Contains Weak Links / Structurally Unsound]"
    justification: "[Summarize how well the different facets of the entity's being form a believable, functioning whole within the heterocosm.]"
    prompts:
      - "Identify the strongest connection *between two different property categories* for this entity (e.g., how history directly shapes psychology)."
      - "Identify the weakest or most potentially contradictory link within the bundle. How can it be strengthened or justified?"

  # --- III. Evaluation of Perceived "Depth" & Complexity (The Experiential Effect) ---
  perceived_depth_evaluation:
    purpose: "Assess how the authenticated property bundle successfully generates the subjective experience of depth, complexity, or 'roundness' for the audience."

    analysis_of_depth_sources:
      - source: "Multifacetedness (Breadth/Detail)"
        contribution_assessment: "[e.g., High contribution. Being defined across physical, functional, psychological, social, historical dimensions prevents flatness.]"
      - source: "Internal Conflicts/Tensions (Authenticated)"
        contribution_assessment: "[e.g., Very high contribution. Kaelen's internal struggles with memory, cynicism, and duty are primary sources of perceived depth.]"
      - source: "Rich Contextual Integration (Systemic Links)"
        contribution_assessment: "[e.g., High contribution. Kaelen's personal mystery is deeply tied to Aethelgard's core historical/political mysteries, giving his struggle larger resonance.]"
      - source: "Strategic Undersaturation (Mystery/Potential)"
        contribution_assessment: "[e.g., Very high contribution. The large gaps in Kaelen's authenticated past create immense perceived depth by inviting speculation and suggesting a vast unknown history.]"
      - source: "Dynamic Potential (Capacity for Change/Development)"
        contribution_assessment: "[e.g., Moderate contribution currently. His core conflicts provide clear potential for future authenticated changes in his psychological/social properties.]"
      - source: "Linguistic Craft & Sensory Detail"
        contribution_assessment: "[e.g., High contribution. Evocative language used to authenticate his physical state, internal thoughts, and sensory perceptions enhances the feeling of presence and complexity.]"

    overall_roundness_rating: "[Rate: Feels Exceptionally Round / Satisfyingly Round / Moderately Developed / Feels Flat]" # Based on Forster's concept, but explained via Dolezel
    justification_via_bundle: |
      [Explain the rating *specifically* by referencing the authenticated bundle. e.g., 
      "Kaelen achieves 'roundness' not through assumed real-world depth, but because his **authenticated bundle** 
      is rich across **multiple property dimensions**, contains significant **authenticated internal conflicts** 
      (cynicism vs. truth-drive), is **deeply integrated** with the world's core mysteries and social structures, 
      and strategically utilizes **undersaturation** regarding his past to create compelling mystery and implied depth. 
      The **linguistic craft** used in authentication further enhances this perception."]

    refinement_for_depth: "[e.g., Could further deepen perceived complexity by authenticating more specific *sensory memories* (even if fragmented) or by introducing a minor internal conflict related to his Undercity dealings vs. Watch protocols.]"
    prompts:
      - "If this entity feels 'deep,' can you pinpoint the specific *authenticated properties* or *internal conflicts* within its bundle that create this feeling?"
      - "How does the *way* information about its properties is revealed (gradually, through conflict, via unreliable sources) contribute to its perceived complexity?"
      - "Where could strategic *addition* of authenticated detail in an undersaturated area significantly enhance perceived depth without violating core concepts?"

  # --- IV. Affirmation of Linguistic Constitution & Sculpting Success ---
  linguistic_constitution_affirmation:
    purpose: "Conclude by reaffirming the entity's reality as a successful semantic construct forged by language, the 'Master Sculptor'."

    acknowledgement_of_textual_basis: |
      We affirm that the entity [Entity Name/ID], in all its perceived complexity and multifacetedness, 
      exists entirely as constituted by the **authenticated semantic information** documented within the 
      Aethelgard Master Codex and primary canonical narratives. Its being is linguistic.

    assessment_of_linguistic_craft: |
      [Evaluate the effectiveness of the language used. e.g., The specific predicates chosen successfully 
      authenticate Kaelen's core traits and functions. The evocative sensory language used grounds his 
      physical presence. The careful management of authentication regarding his past effectively builds 
      mystery. The linguistic sculpting achieves the intended complex character profile.]

    final_statement_on_entity_reality: |
      [Entity Name/ID] stands as a testament to the power of **authenticated predication across a rich palette** 
      of properties. It demonstrates how internal coherence, systemic integration, purposeful design, and strategic 
      undersaturation can create a compelling, multifaceted fictional being entirely within the bounds of a 
      textually constituted heterocosm. Its perceived depth is an achievement of **semantic architecture**.

  prompts_final_affirmation:
    - "Does the final, synthesized entity profile accurately reflect the intended vision?"
    - "Does it feel like a complete (within undersaturation limits) and functional component of the Aethelgard heterocosm?"
    - "Ultimately, does the linguistic 'sculpture' succeed in conveying the intended essence and complexity?"

# --- End of Entity Synthesis & Richness Review ---


How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for the Synthesis Conclusion:

Explicit Synthesis Goal: The Introduction and Section Purpose fields clearly state the goal is to synthesize the preceding taxonomic analysis into a holistic evaluation of multifaceted complexity arising from the property bundle.

Comprehensive Dimension Checklist: Section I requires systematically reviewing the presence and significance of all property categories identified in the taxonomy, forcing a comprehensive assessment of multifacetedness.

Deep Coherence Check (Internal Bundle): Section II focuses specifically on the internal coherence within the bundle – how properties from different categories interact logically or create meaningful tension.

Granular Analysis of "Depth": Section III breaks down the sources of perceived depth (multifacetedness, internal conflict, context, undersaturation, dynamism, linguistic craft) and demands assessment of each contributor, grounding the subjective feeling in objective textual features. Requires justification via the bundle.

Formal Ontology Reaffirmation: Section IV includes an explicit affirmation of the entity's purely linguistic/semantic constitution, directly referencing Doležel's core principles.

Rigorous Prompts: Includes prompts designed to force deep reflection on how complexity is achieved, the role of specific property combinations, the effectiveness of undersaturation, and the success of the linguistic construction.

Focus on Architecture & Craft: Consistently uses metaphors of architecture and sculpting, framing the evaluation in terms of design success and creator craft in manipulating semantic materials.

Clear Links to Previous Analysis: Assumes and requires reference back to the detailed property definitions established in preceding protocols (implied by the structure).

This extremely detailed YAML template provides a framework for a rigorous final assessment of fictional entities, ensuring they are not just lists of traits but coherent, complex, multifaceted beings constituted effectively through the rich palette of authenticated properties available within the Doležel-inspired semantic architecture of your world.
