# Story World Codex: Entity Historical Properties Protocol
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.G (Imbuing Entities with a Past)

**World:** [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]
**Codex Version:** [e.g., 0.1 - Historical Grounding]
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]
**Lead Architect(s):** [Your Name / Studio Name]

## Introduction: Weaving the Past into Present Being

*This protocol guides the definition of the **historical properties** of entities within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Following Doležel, an entity's connection to the past – its origins, lineage, past experiences, and associations with historical events or objects – exists only as **constituted through authenticated predication**.*

*Use this document to explicitly define these historical links for key entities. Focus on **authentication**: establish *how* this past connection is validated within the world (narration, records, memory, physical evidence) and how it **informs the entity's present reality**, providing depth, context, motivation, and narrative potential. Treat history not as static backstory, but as an active component of the entity's current constitution.*

### Historical Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity emerging from the entity's authenticated links to the past.*

*   **Core Historical Identity:** `[Summarize how the authenticated past defines the entity. e.g., Kaelen is fundamentally constituted by a **lack** of authenticated personal history (amnesia), making his present actions entirely a quest *into* the past. His few potential links (Artificer flashes, predecessor's items) position him as a potential key to unlocking the world's central historical mysteries (Shattering, Artificers).]`
*   **Primary Narrative Functions Served by History:** `[List key roles enabled by historical properties. e.g., Provide Backstory/Motivation; Explain Current Capabilities/Limitations; Connect to Core World Mysteries; Embody Themes (Legacy, Memory); Drive Historical Investigation Plots; Establish Stakes based on Past Events.]`
*   **Key Conflicts Arising from History:** `[Identify conflicts generated *by* historical properties. e.g., Kaelen's amnesia vs. world's secrets; Guild rivalries rooted in authenticated past conflicts; Need to use dangerous Artificer tech due to loss of historical knowledge; Conflict between official history and discovered truths.]`
*   **Undersaturation & Potential:** `[Highlight how undefined historical properties create narrative potential. e.g., Kaelen's true origin remains a major potential reveal; the full story of the Dark Years allows for future prequel narratives; the ambiguity surrounding Artificer actions allows for diverse interpretations/plot twists.]`

**How This Markdown Document Guides Historical Design:**

1.  **Focus on Connection:** Centers on defining the entity's authenticated *links* to the past, rather than just listing general history.
2.  **Categorization of Links:** Breaks down historical properties into distinct types (Origin, Lineage, Experience, Association, Change) for systematic coverage.
3.  **Requires Authentication Proof:** Demands specifying *how* each historical property is validated within the world (records, memory, artifacts, etc.).
4.  **Links Past to Present:** Explicitly asks for the *resulting present property* or consequence arising from past experiences or origins.
5.  **Integrates with World History:** Assumes reference to a master History Protocol/Timeline for consistency with major authenticated events.
6.  **Highlights Narrative Function:** Requires articulating *why* this historical property matters for the story, character, or themes.
7.  **Manages Historical Ambiguity:** Includes consideration of legendary status, rumors, and deliberately undersaturated historical knowledge as part of the design.
8.  **Systemic View:** Encourages seeing how an entity's historical properties position it within the larger temporal and causal network of the heterocosm.

By using this protocol, you can ensure that the entities inhabiting Aethelgard possess a rich, consistent, and functionally significant connection to the world's authenticated past, giving them depth, motivation, and integrating them fully into the temporal dimension of your heterocosm.
