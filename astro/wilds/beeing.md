Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template designed to help you meticulously define the entities of your story world using the **Taxonomy of Properties** discussed in **"III. The Taxonomy of Properties: Dissecting the Dimensions of Fictional Being,"** based on Lubomír Doležel's *Heterocosmica*.

This protocol encourages you to think systematically about the **different facets** of each entity's being (physical, functional, psychological, social, etc.) and to **explicitly authenticate** the key properties within each category that constitute its reality within your heterocosm. It functions as a detailed character/object/location profile builder, emphasizing multifaceted definition.

# Story World Codex: Entity Constitution Protocol (Taxonomy of Properties Method)

**World:** [Your Story World Name, e.g., Aethelgard]

## Introduction: Building Multifaceted Entities via Property Bundles

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of entities within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm using Doležel's concept of entities as **bundles of diverse, authenticated properties**. It employs a **taxonomy** based on different dimensions of being to ensure a multifaceted and systematic approach to entity constitution.*

*For each significant entity, define its key properties within each relevant category below. Focus on **authentication**: list only properties considered 'true' or factual *for this world*, citing the primary source (narrative text, design doc, this Codex entry). Use comments `#` for nuances, potential developments, or subjective perceptions attributed to other characters.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle (Taxonomic Breakdown):

**1. Physical Properties (Tangible Manifestation):**
   *Purpose: Define the entity's perceivable form, material, and sensory attributes.*
    *   `- Form/Structure: [e.g., Lean humanoid; Massive industrial district defined by towering smokestacks and elevated cog-railways; Faceted crystalline shard approx. 1 meter long.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Material/Composition: [e.g., Baseline human biology with brass prosthetic left arm; Primarily iron, steel, soot-stained brick; Unknown crystalline material, resonates faintly.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Key Visuals (Color/Texture/Detail): [e.g., Worn leather coat, piercing grey eyes, scar; Pervasive rust and oil stains, flickering gaslights, visible steam pipes; Crystal has internal fractures that refract light into unsettling spectrums.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Auditory Signature (Passive): [e.g., Quiet footsteps, subtle click from prosthetic; Constant background clang/hiss/grind of machinery; Emits a low, almost sub-audible hum.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Olfactory Signature (Passive): [e.g., Faint scent of ozone and damp wool; Overpowering smell of coal smoke, hot metal, industrial solvents; Odorless, but air feels strangely 'thin' nearby.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Tactile Qualities (Implied/Direct): [e.g., Prosthetic feels cool, worn smooth; Ground vibrates constantly from machinery; Crystal feels unnaturally cold and smooth, pulses faintly when held.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Note key undefined physical details, e.g., Precise internal layout of every building in district; Exact crystalline structure of shard.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the entity *does* or *can/cannot do* within world rules.*
    *   `- Primary Function/Role: [e.g., Investigator of anomalies/crimes; Industrial production hub; Potential power source / MacGuffin.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Key Abilities/Skills: [e.g., Deductive reasoning, lockpicking, basic self-defense; Mass production of clockwork parts; Emits powerful temporal energy when activated (controlled?).]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Key Limitations/Weaknesses: [e.g., Amnesia hinders investigation, lacks political clout; Dependent on continuous fuel supply, vulnerable to sabotage; Requires specific attunement/ritual to activate, drains user severely.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Operational Parameters (if applicable): [e.g., Requires specific tools/clearance for investigation; Production quotas set by Gearwright Guild; Activation only possible during specific lunar phase alignments.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Note key undefined functions/limits, e.g., Full range of shard's powers; Kaelen's proficiency with heavy weapons.]`

**3. Psychological / Mental Properties (For Sentient Entities):**
   *Purpose: Define the authenticated inner life, personality, beliefs, and motivations.*
    *   `- Core Traits: [e.g., Cynical, Persistent, Secretly Idealistic; Collective mindset focused on efficiency/production (District 'Personality'); N/A for object.]` # Auth: [Source - Narration, Dialogue, Actions]
    *   `- Motivations/Goals: [e.g., Uncover own past, seek justice (Kaelen); Maximize production output, gain political advantage (District goal via Guild); Unknown/Inert (Shard?).]` # Auth: [Source]

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Place in World System):**
   *Purpose: Define the entity's position within social, political, cultural, or taxonomic structures.*
    *   `- Official Role/Status: [e.g., City Watch Investigator (Low Rank); Designated Industrial Zone; Legendary Artifact (Contested Ownership).]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Factional Affiliation: [e.g., Nominally City Watch, interacts cautiously with Undercity; Controlled by Gearwright Guild; Sought by Chronometers, Memory Keepers, potentially others.]` # Auth: [Source]

### Entity Constitution Summary:

*Purpose: Briefly synthesize the core nature and function arising from the property bundle.*

*   **Core Identity:** `[Summarize the entity based on its most defining properties across categories. e.g., Kaelen is constituted as a functionally capable but psychologically fragmented Investigator, whose value lies in his unique perspective (amnesia + sensitivity) and skills, operating within significant social and epistemic constraints dictated by Aethelgard's structure.]`
*   **Primary Role in Heterocosm:** `[Define its main function within the world system, e.g., Protagonist driving mystery; Engine of industrial economy; Central object of desire/conflict.]`
*   **Key Internal Tensions:** `[Identify conflicts arising *from within* the property bundle itself, e.g., Kaelen: Drive for truth vs. Lack of memory/authority; Gearwright Quarter: Need for production vs. Environmental/Social cost; Moon Shard: Immense power vs. Extreme danger/instability.]`

**How This Markdown Document Uses the Taxonomy:**

1.  **Structured Breakdown:** It organizes the entity definition explicitly according to Doležel's property categories (Physical, Functional, Psychological, Social, Modal, Axiological, Historical).
2.  **Prompts for Multifacetedness:** Forces the creator to consider *all* relevant dimensions of the entity's being within the heterocosm, not just appearance or basic function.
3.  **Focus on Authentication:** Each property listed requires explicit or implicit authentication within the creator's established canon (Codex, narratives).
4.  **Highlights Undersaturation:** Includes sections to consciously note what remains *undefined* within each category, embracing Doležel's concept of necessary incompleteness and leaving room for future development.
5.  **Connects to World System:** Encourages linking properties to broader world rules (Modalities), social structures (Social/Relational), and history (Historical).
6.  **Encourages Specificity:** The detailed breakdown pushes for more specific and nuanced property definitions rather than generic descriptions.
7.  **Synthesizes Essence:** The concluding summary helps articulate the entity's core identity as it emerges from the *combination* of its diverse properties.

By using this taxonomic approach, you ensure that the entities populating your world are not just names or simple concepts, but are systematically constructed, multifaceted beings with clearly defined (and undefined) characteristics, grounded firmly within the semantic reality of your heterocosm.
