# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly detailed methodology** for the **systematic analysis 
    and deep structural mapping** of the **Governing Modalities** of the Aethelgard heterocosm. 
    Building upon Doležel's core thesis, it treats the modal structure (Alethic, Deontic, 
    Axiological, Epistemic) not merely as world features, but as the **fundamental analytical engine** 
    for understanding the world's internal logic, narrative potential, thematic preoccupations, 
    and generic identity.
  scope: |
    Guides the analyst in moving beyond surface description to rigorously reconstruct and interpret 
    the complex system of authenticated rules governing possibility, obligation, value, and knowledge. 
    Focuses on identifying precise modal configurations, analyzing their intricate interplay, and 
    understanding their foundational role in constituting the heterocosmic reality.
  methodological_stance: |
    **Strictly Text-Centric & Semantic:** Analysis is based *solely* on identifying patterns of 
    **authenticated predication** within the defined canonical corpus. Inferred modal rules must be 
    demonstrably supported by consistent textual evidence (explicit statements or validated patterns 
    of events/properties). External logic or AW assumptions are used only for contrast or baseline 
    understanding (minimal departure).

    justification: "[Explain classification by referencing specific dominant/deviant modal authentications.]"

  rationale_synthesis: "Understanding the total modal configuration and interplay reveals the deepest level of the heterocosm's structural identity and provides the most rigorous basis for comparative genre analysis."

# --- VII. Conclusion: Modality as the Key to Heterocosmic Logic ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    This protocol provides the **analytical engine** for dissecting the **fundamental operational logic** 
    of the Aethelgard heterocosm through the rigorous mapping of its **authenticated modal structures**. 
    By systematically analyzing the world's legislated rules of **Possibility (Alethic), Obligation 
    (Deontic), Value (Axiological), and Knowledge (Epistemic)**, and their intricate **interplay**, 
    we move beyond surface description to grasp the deep architecture governing all entities and events.
  final_statement: |
    The modal structure **IS** the constitution of Aethelgard's reality. Its specific configuration defines 
    the world's unique signature, enables and constrains its narrative potential, grounds its thematic inquiries, 
    and provides the ultimate basis for assessing its internal coherence. Mastering the analysis of these 
    foundational laws, as authenticated by the narrative discourse, is therefore indispensable for any profound 
    understanding of this, or any, fictional heterocosm within Doležel's powerful semantic framework. It reveals 
    the sophisticated logic underlying the linguistic forge.

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Modal Analysis:

Rigorous Theoretical Framing: Introduction and Conclusion strongly emphasize modalities as the foundational operating system and world constitution, using precise Doležel-inspired terminology.

Exhaustive Task Breakdown: Each modality analysis (Sections II-V) is broken down into multiple specific analytical tasks, demanding comprehensive investigation (e.g., baseline physics vs. tech limits vs. biology under Alethic; formal laws vs. faction codes vs. social norms under Deontic).

Mandatory Evidence & Authentication Focus: Continuously stresses the need to base analysis only on authenticated textual evidence and to consider the mode and reliability of authentication for modal rules.

Deep Interplay Analysis: Section VI requires not just identifying modalities but analyzing their specific configuration, hierarchy, and points of interaction, defining the world's unique "signature."

Structurally Grounded Genre Typology: Section VI uses the detailed modal analysis to provide a structural justification for genre classification, moving beyond simple content markers.

Granular Prompts & Checks: Includes highly specific prompts pushing the analyst to consider edge cases, consistency across different domains, thematic links, and potential ambiguities within the modal framework.

Emphasis on Systemic Logic: Frames the entire exercise as uncovering the deep logical structure that governs the heterocosm's functioning.

Clear Output Definition: Suggests specific outputs for different analytical tasks (e.g., "modal profile summary," "comparative analysis," "coherence report," "epistemic source reliability chart").

This extremely detailed YAML template provides a comprehensive and theoretically rigorous guide for conducting an advanced analysis of the modal structures governing Aethelgard, enabling a deep understanding of its fundamental operational logic and unique identity within Doležel's framework.
