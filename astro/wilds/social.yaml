# Story World Codex: Entity Social & Relational Profile Protocol
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Systemic Placement)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]

# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly granular framework** for the meticulous definition 
    of the **social, relational, and categorical properties** of entities within the Aethelgard heterocosm. 
    Building upon Doležel's principle that entities are constituted by property bundles, this protocol focuses 
    on the **extrinsic dimensions** – defining an entity by its **authenticated position, function, and 
    connections within the intricate socio-political, cultural, familial, and taxonomic networks** 
    of the world.
  scope: |
    Mandatory template for defining the systemic placement of all significant canonical entities. Ensures 
    complex social dynamics are grounded in authenticated structures, clarifies power relations, establishes 
    context for character motivation/conflict, and links individual entities explicitly to the macro-level 
    organization of the heterocosm.
  ontological_premise: |
    An entity's social identity and function are not inherent but are **constituted by the specific set of 
    authenticated roles, statuses, affiliations, relationships, and classifications** assigned to it by 
    the narrative discourse, as codified herein. These properties operate within and are constrained by 
    the world's established Deontic, Axiological, and Epistemic modalities.

      "The Chronometers Guild is constituted as the **apex predator** within Aethelgard's socio-political ecosystem. 
      Its **authenticated control over Chrono-Dust refinement (Economic/Tech Relation)** grants it **immense leverage** 
      over other Guilds (Political Relation) and dictates much of the city's **economic reality**. Its **internal 
      structure is rigidly hierarchical** (Social Property), valuing **precision and secrecy** (Axiological/Deontic), 
      and its **relationship with historical truth is suspect** (Epistemic/Social Reputation). Its **primary functional 
      role** is maintaining temporal stability (officially) while consolidating power (unofficially), placing it in 
      **inherent conflict** with factions seeking autonomy (Undercity) or alternative power bases (Gearwrights)."]

# --- End of Entity Social/Relational Profile ---


How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Social/Relational Properties:

Granular Categories: Breaks down the social dimension into distinct facets: Formal Roles, Status/Hierarchy, Factional Profile, Kinship, Species/Type, Location Affiliation, Cultural Significance.

Focus on Authenticated Detail: Demands explicit authentication for each property, including specific ranks, titles, legal statuses, relationship dynamics, and perceived reputations within the world.

Integration with Modalities: Explicitly links social roles to Deontic obligations, status to Axiological perception, affiliations to Epistemic access, etc.

Dynamic Relationships: Encourages defining the nature and stability of relationships, not just their existence.

Multi-faceted Perspective: Includes analysis of how an entity is perceived differently by various groups (Cultural Significance / Reputation).

Emphasis on Function: Requires articulating the narrative function served by the entity's specific social position and relationships.

Deep Prompts: Includes prompts pushing for highly specific details about powers, limitations, social markers, conflicts arising from status, and mechanisms of social change within Aethelgard.

Systemic Synthesis: The summary requires articulating the entity's identity as emerging from its complex position within the entire social, political, and relational network.

This extremely detailed YAML template guides the creator to meticulously construct the social and relational identity of entities within Aethelgard, ensuring they are deeply embedded within a complex, coherent, and functionally significant societal fabric, fully realizing the potential of Doležel's framework for analyzing the systemic placement of fictional beings.
