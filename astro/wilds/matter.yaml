# Story World Codex: Entity Physical Constitution & Sensory Profile Protocol
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Physical Properties)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly granular framework** for the meticulous definition 
    of the **physical and sensory properties** of entities within the Aethelgard heterocosm. 
    Applying Doležel's principle that entities are bundles of authenticated properties, this protocol 
    focuses on **constituting the tangible, perceivable reality** of persons, objects, places, 
    and creatures through **explicitly authenticated, richly detailed, and multi-sensory predicates**.
  scope: |
    Mandatory template for defining the physical constitution of all significant canonical entities. 
    Emphasizes moving beyond basic description to establish a **vivid, consistent, and functionally 
    relevant sensory landscape** that grounds the world and enhances immersion. Treats sensory details 
    as core ontological components.
  ontological_premise: |
    An entity's physical reality within Aethelgard exists **only** as defined by the sum total of its 
    authenticated physical and sensory properties documented herein and in core texts. Undefined physical 
    attributes **do not exist** for the entity within the heterocosm. Coherence requires consistent 
    application of these properties.

      e.g., "The Aethelgard City Watch Uniform, though standardized in cut (PROPERTY), is constituted primarily by its 
      **authenticated state of perpetual dampness and wear** (TEXTURE/STATE), carrying the **faint smell of mildew 
      and issued cleaning solvent** (OLFACTORY), its brass buttons invariably **tarnished green** (VISUAL/PATINA). 
      Its physical reality embodies the Watch's **underfunded status and struggle against the city's pervasive decay**, 
      contrasting sharply with pristine Guild attire."]

    functionality_derived_from_physicality: "[How physical properties enable/constrain function: e.g., Worn state offers poor protection (Limitation); Dark color aids camouflage in shadows (Minor Ability); Recognizable silhouette identifies wearer's role (Social Function via Physicality).]"
    atmospheric_thematic_contribution: "[How physicality reinforces tone/theme: e.g., Contributes to Noir atmosphere, embodies themes of Decay, Order struggling, potentially Beauty in Imperfection if well-maintained *despite* conditions.]"

# --- End of Entity Physical Profile ---


How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Physical Properties:

Granular Subcategories: Breaks down major physical aspects (Form, Material, Surface, Luminosity, State, Sensory Emanations, Movement) into highly specific sub-points.

Multi-Sensory Integration: Explicitly includes dedicated fields and prompts for Auditory, Olfactory, Tactile, and even Gustatory properties alongside Visuals within the core physical description.

Emphasis on Specificity: Examples use highly specific, evocative language (e.g., "skin like aged parchment," "iridescent blues/purples," "resonant crystalline chimes," "ozone and burnt time," "numbs fingertips," "temporal frostbite").

State vs. Trait: Differentiates between inherent material properties and the entity's current state (repair, decay, age).

Dynamic Properties Included: Incorporates how appearance or sensory output might change based on state or function (e.g., glowing brighter when stressed, color shifts with temporal flux).

Explicit Undersaturation: Requires noting undefined aspects for each major physical category, pushing for conscious awareness of what isn't being defined.

Deep Prompts: Includes highly targeted prompts within each section pushing for deeper consideration of sensory details, functional implications, and thematic connections related specifically to physical constitution.

Synthesis Focused on Function: The summary demands articulating how the specific bundle of physical properties contributes to the entity's overall function, sensory impact, and thematic role.

Rigorous Authentication Citation: Maintains the requirement to cite authentication sources for all significant properties.

This extremely detailed template forces a creator to move far beyond basic physical description and truly constitute the tangible, multi-sensory reality of their entities within the Aethelgard heterocosm, grounding the world in vivid, consistent, and functionally relevant physical detail as demanded by a rigorous application of Doležel's principles.
