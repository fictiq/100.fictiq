# Story World Codex: Entity Functional Profile Protocol
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Functional Properties)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly granular framework** for the meticulous definition 
    of the **functional properties** of entities within the Aethelgard heterocosm. Building upon 
    Doležel's ontology, it focuses on constituting the **dynamic potential** of entities – what they 
    *can* and *cannot* do, *how* they operate, their inherent skills, acquired expertise, unique 
    powers, critical weaknesses, operational costs, and action parameters – all through **explicitly 
    authenticated predication**.
  scope: |
    Mandatory template for defining the functional dimension of all significant canonical entities 
    (persons, objects, places with active functions, creatures, organizations, systems). Ensures 
    consistent application of world rules (modalities), grounds narrative action in believable 
    (internal logic) capabilities, establishes clear stakes, and defines mechanisms for conflict 
    and problem-solving.
  ontological_premise: |
    An entity's functional potential exists **only** as defined by its bundle of authenticated 
    functional properties (capabilities & limitations). These properties directly instantiate and 
    are constrained by the heterocosm's established **Alethic Modality** (laws of possibility/necessity) 
    and often interact with Deontic, Axiological, and Epistemic structures. Undefined functions 
    are non-existent for the entity within the canonical heterocosm.

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Functional Properties:

Granular Categorization: Breaks down function into Capabilities (Innate, Learned, Tech/Magic), Inabilities, Vulnerabilities, and Costs/Dependencies/Operational Constraints, demanding detailed consideration of each facet.

Specific Parameter Fields: Within capabilities and constraints, includes fields for scope_intensity, limits/nuances, trigger, consequence, justification, forcing precise definition beyond simple statements.

Explicit Authentication Citation: Maintains the requirement to link each functional property back to its canonical source.

Sensory Integration: Includes fields for sensory_tell associated with functions, linking dynamic potential back to perceivable reality.

Narrative Function Analysis: Explicitly requires analyzing the purpose of each limitation or capability within the narrative (e.g., "drives core motivation," "creates specific obstacle," "limits power scaling").

Deep Prompts: Includes highly specific prompts pushing for detailed consideration of interactions with world rules, potential for exploitation, conditions of failure, and systemic impact.

Rigorous Synthesis: The summary section demands a detailed articulation of the entity's functional identity based on the complex interplay of its strengths and weaknesses, its role, and its relationship to core world mechanics.

Focus on Internal Logic: Continuously emphasizes defining functions within the established rules (modalities) of the Aethelgard heterocosm.

This extremely detailed YAML template provides a robust framework for defining the dynamic potential of entities within your world. By meticulously authenticating not just what they can do, but precisely how, at what cost, and what they cannot do, you build a foundation for logical action, meaningful conflict, and a truly coherent and functional heterocosmic system.
