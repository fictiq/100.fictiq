# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly detailed framework** for analyzing and designing the 
    **dynamic interplay between Fictional Persons (Characters) and the Sequence of Events (Plot)** 
    within the Aethelgard heterocosm. Integrating Doležel's principles, it treats characters as 
    **bundles of authenticated properties** whose actions drive plot, while simultaneously viewing plot 
    as a sequence of **authenticated events** that unfolds *within* and is *constrained by* both the 
    characters' constitutions and the broader world structure.
  scope: |
    Mandatory for designing core narrative arcs, character development paths, and key plot sequences. 
    Ensures character actions are plausibly motivated by their authenticated properties, plot events 
    are consistent with character capabilities/limitations and world rules, and the relationship 
    between character agency and narrative progression is coherent and meaningful.
  ontological_premise: |
    Characters **ARE** their authenticated property bundles. Plot **IS** the authenticated sequence of 
    state changes within the heterocosm. Their relationship is **systemic**: properties enable/motivate 
    actions constituting events; events impact/change entity properties and world states, creating 
    new conditions for subsequent actions. All analysis must be grounded in **textual authentication**.

# --- I. Character Property Bundles as Narrative Potential ---
# Purpose: Analyze how the detailed, authenticated property bundle of a character creates specific potential 
#          (and limitations) for their role and actions within narrative sequences.
character_bundle_as_potential:
  
  entity_id_under_analysis: "[e.g., CHAR_Kaelen_01]"
  link_to_full_profile: "[Link to Kaelen's Detailed Constitution Protocol Entry]"

  analysis_points:
    - facet: "Functional Properties (Capabilities & Limitations)"
      narrative_potential_derived: |
        - **Enables:** Investigation plots (Deduction Skill); Survival in specific situations (Temporal Sensitivity 
          as warning); Basic self-defense scenarios.
        - **Constrains:** Cannot overcome powerful physical threats directly; Cannot access high-level Guild data 
          (requires alternative methods like social engineering, stealth, relying on allies); Vulnerability to 
          temporal effects creates personal risk during investigation of anomalies.
        - **Plot Hooks:** Need for prosthetic maintenance; Exploitation of temporal sensitivity by antagonists; 
          Situations requiring skills he lacks, forcing reliance on others (e.g., CHAR_Rust).
      consistency_check_prompt: "Are all planned major actions for this character demonstrably possible given their *authenticated* functional profile and the world's alethic modalities?"

    - facet: "Psychological Properties (Motivations, Beliefs, Traits, Flaws)"
      narrative_potential_derived: |
        - **Enables:** Driving motivation for core mystery (Amnesia + Truth-Seeking); Justification for persistent, 
          obsessive investigation (Core Trait); Cynicism allowing him to see through deception (Belief/Trait); 
          Moments of empathy creating potential for unexpected alliances (Trait).
        - **Constrains:** Distrust/Isolationism limits ability to form stable alliances or accept help; Obsessiveness 
          can lead to recklessness/tunnel vision (Flaw); Cynicism may cause misjudgment of genuinely helpful individuals.
        - **Plot Hooks:** Internal conflict between duty/cynicism/truth drive; Exploitation of his amnesia by others; 
          Situations forcing him to confront his isolation; Plot twists challenging his core beliefs.
      consistency_check_prompt: "Are the character's key decisions and reactions consistently motivated by their *authenticated* psychological bundle, or do they act 'out of character' for plot convenience?"

    - facet: "Social/Relational Properties (Role, Status, Connections)"
      narrative_potential_derived: |
        - **Enables:** Limited official access/authority via Watch role; Access to specific Undercity networks via 
          relationship with Rust; Potential leverage/danger if Vance lineage rumor is true/pursued.
        - **Constrains:** Guildless status prevents access to resources/power; Watch affiliation creates conflict 
          with Undercity dealings; Lack of strong allies makes him vulnerable.
        - **Plot Hooks:** Conflicts arising from conflicting loyalties (Watch vs. Undercity contacts); Political 
          maneuvering attempting to use/discredit him due to his status; Quests to improve social standing or 
          uncover true affiliation.
      consistency_check_prompt: "Do the character's interactions and the reactions of others consistently reflect their *authenticated* social position and relationships within Aethelgard's hierarchy?"

    - facet: "Historical Properties (Origins, Past Experiences)"
      narrative_potential_derived: |
        - **Enables:** Core mystery drive due to amnesia (lack of history IS the property); Fragmented flashes 
          provide cryptic clues; Inherited items (badge, chronometer) provide initial tools/identity markers.
        - **Constrains:** Lack of past knowledge makes him vulnerable to manipulation, unable to access memory-keyed 
          locks/systems, lacking established contacts/resources from before.
        - **Plot Hooks:** Direct quest to uncover origin; Encounters with people/places triggering memory flashes; 
          Antagonists exploiting his unknown past.
      consistency_check_prompt: "Does the narrative consistently respect the character's authenticated historical knowledge (or lack thereof)? Are memory reveals handled as significant plot points?"

  synthesis_prompt: |
    Considering the *entire* authenticated property bundle, what specific *types* of narrative arcs or plot functions 
    is this character uniquely suited for within Aethelgard? What stories become possible *only because* this character 
    is constituted exactly this way? Where do the interactions *between* different property types (e.g., skill vs. flaw, 
    motivation vs. social limit) generate the most narrative energy?

# --- II. Plot Events as Authenticated State Changes & Property Modifiers ---
# Purpose: Analyze narrative events not just as plot progression, but as authenticated actions that reveal, test, 
#          and potentially *modify* entity property bundles and world states.
plot_events_as_authentication_modification:

  event_analysis_template: # Use for key plot points/sequences

      - entity_id: "[e.g., LOC_MemoryArchive]"
        properties: "[e.g., Functional: Security systems (alarms, patrols) demonstrated; Physical: Labyrinthine layout confirmed as obstacle; Epistemic: Information confirmed as restricted.]"
      # - List other entities involved and properties revealed/tested...
    
    modalities_instantiated_tested:
      - modality: "[e.g., Deontic]"
        instantiation: "[e.g., Act demonstrates severe consequences (risk of memory wipe) for violating authenticated Guild Law (DEO-001).]"
      - modality: "[e.g., Alethic]"
        instantiation: "[e.g., Success depends on using authenticated tech (viewer, tools) within its established limits; failure might trigger authenticated temporal instability.]"
      # - Analyze how the event demonstrates or pushes against world rules...

    authenticated_state_changes_resulting: # What properties/relations are *changed* by this event?
      - entity_id: "[e.g., CHAR_Kaelen_01]"
        change_description: "[e.g., Acquires new authenticated knowledge (Epistemic Property change); Gains 'Marked by Memory Keepers' status (new Social/Relational Property); Potentially suffers minor Temporal Sickness (Physical Property change).]"
        authentication_method: "[e.g., Narrative states discovery; Subsequent actions by Keepers; Description of symptoms.]"
      - entity_id: "[e.g., FACTION_MemoryKeepers]"
        change_description: "[e.g., Authenticated Epistemic State changes (they know about the breach); Potential Political State change (increased internal security).]"
        authentication_method: "[e.g., Subsequent Keeper actions; Narrator description of new protocols.]"
      # - List all significant authenticated changes to entity bundles or global states...

    coherence_check: |
      [Assess: Did the event unfold logically based on the pre-existing authenticated properties and modalities? 
      Were character actions consistent with their profiles? Were the consequences plausible within world rules? 
      Were any necessary capabilities/outcomes unauthenticated ('plot armor' or 'deus ex machina')?]
      [e.g., Coherent, relies on established skills and world rules regarding security and information access.]

  prompts_event_analysis:
    - "For a major turning point, list every entity involved. What specific authenticated property of each entity was crucial for the event unfolding as it did?"
    - "How did this event *demonstrate* a core rule (modality) of Aethelgard in action?"
    - "What specific properties or relations were *permanently changed* (re-authenticated) as a direct result of this event?"
    - "Could this event have happened plausibly if a key character's core property or a world rule was different?"

# --- III. Narrative Sequence as Constrained by World Architecture ---
# Purpose: Analyze how the overall sequence of plot events is shaped and limited by the foundational 
#          structure of the heterocosm (entities, modalities, history, state).
narrative_sequence_constraints:

  analysis_of_plot_structure:
    plot_arc_id: "[e.g., ARC_Main_Season1_Conspiracy]"
    core_plot_summary: "[e.g., Kaelen investigates memory anomalies, uncovers Guild conspiracy related to controlling historical narratives via flawed Chrono-Tech.]"
    
    key_constraints_shaping_arc:
      - constraint_type: "Modal (Alethic/Epistemic)"
        constraint_element: "[e.g., Impossibility of directly viewing/altering distant past; Unreliability of Chrono-Viewers; Difficulty accessing true historical data.]"
        impact_on_plot: "[e.g., Forces plot towards deduction, finding physical clues, unreliable witnesses, infiltration of archives, rather than simple 'look at the past'. Creates inherent uncertainty and potential for red herrings.]"
      - constraint_type: "Entity Properties (Kaelen's Limitations)"
        constraint_element: "[e.g., Amnesia; Lack of authority/resources; Physical vulnerability.]"
        impact_on_plot: "[e.g., Necessitates reliance on untrustworthy allies (Rust); Forces covert/risky actions; Makes direct confrontation difficult; Personal stakes intrinsically linked to plot mystery.]"
      - constraint_type: "Social/Political Structure"
        constraint_element: "[e.g., Guild secrecy/power; Council ineffectiveness; Surface/Undercity divide.]"
        impact_on_plot: "[e.g., Creates powerful antagonists with resources; Official channels are ineffective; Requires navigating dangerous social boundaries.]"
      - constraint_type: "Historical Context"
        constraint_element: "[e.g., Legacy of Shattering/First Paradox creates fear/justification for control; Contested history IS the object of conspiracy.]"
        impact_on_plot: "[e.g., Provides underlying motivation for antagonists; Defines the stakes of uncovering the truth.]"

    coherence_check: "Does the overall arc progression feel like a logical unfolding of events *within* these combined constraints? Are solutions earned according to world rules?"
    assessment: "[e.g., Yes, the plot structure seems organically generated by the specific challenges and possibilities inherent in Aethelgard's authenticated architecture.]"

  analysis_of_narrative_pathways:
    question: "How does the world architecture (spatial relations, social networks, information access rules) define the *possible pathways* the narrative can take?"
    analysis: |
      [e.g., Kaelen *cannot* simply walk into Chronometer HQ; he *must* go through official (likely blocked) channels, illicit Undercity routes, or complex social engineering based on established relations and security protocols. 
      Information *cannot* be easily Googled; it *must* be found in specific authenticated locations (Archives, ruins), extracted from entities (dialogue, memory tech), or deduced from physical evidence, constrained by epistemic rules. 
      These constraints shape the sequence and nature of narrative scenes.]

  prompts_sequence:
    - "Identify the core 'problem' of your main plot. Now list 5 specific authenticated world constraints that make solving it difficult and interesting."
    - "How does the *order* in which information is revealed (a function of narrative sequence interacting with epistemic constraints) build suspense or create misdirection?"
    - "Could your planned plot climax occur plausibly given the established capabilities and limitations of the characters and world rules?"

# --- IV. Ensuring Coherence Between Character Agency and Plot Demands ---
# Purpose: Explicitly verify that character actions driving the plot are consistent with their authenticated 
#          property bundles, avoiding 'plot-driven' character inconsistency.
character_plot_coherence:

  scenario_analysis:
    - scenario: "[e.g., Kaelen decides to trust Master Vance despite his authenticated cynicism.]"
      character_id: "CHAR_Kaelen_01"
      plot_necessity: "[e.g., Required for Kaelen to gain access to crucial information Vance possesses.]"
      consistency_check:
        question: "Does Kaelen's authenticated psychological bundle (cynicism, past betrayals?) make this act of trust plausible *at this specific point* in his development arc?"
        analysis: "[e.g., Potentially inconsistent if occurring early. Requires either: 1) Strong preceding events authenticating a *shift* in Kaelen's belief/emotional state regarding Vance. 2) Framing the 'trust' as a calculated risk or act of desperation consistent with his core motivation overriding cynicism. 3) Acknowledging it as a moment of uncharacteristic behavior with potential negative consequences.]"
      resolution: "[e.g., Add preceding scene where Vance provides verifiable aid, slightly lowering Kaelen's distrust; Frame Kaelen's internal monologue as acknowledging the huge risk but seeing no alternative to pursue his primary goal.]"

    - scenario: "[e.g., Automaton 'Ticker' deliberately lies to protect Kaelen.]"
      character_id: "AI_Ticker_734"
      plot_necessity: "[e.g., Creates suspense, protects protagonist.]"
      consistency_check:
        question: "Does Ticker's authenticated functional/psychological profile (logic-driven, literal-minded, potentially lacking true agency/understanding of deception) make deliberate lying plausible?"
        analysis: "[e.g., Highly inconsistent with established baseline properties. Would require significant prior authentication of emergent understanding of truth/falsehood, empathy, and capacity for independent action violating core programming (potentially a major character arc itself).]"
      resolution: "[e.g., Reject this plot point OR fundamentally revise Ticker's authenticated properties via a preceding developmental arc OR reframe the action (e.g., Ticker provides *incomplete* but *literally true* information that misleads).]"

    # --- Analyze other key moments where character action drives plot ---

  prompts_character_plot:
    - "Identify a moment where a character needs to do something specific for the plot to advance. Does their *authenticated* property bundle (skills, motivations, limitations, relationships) fully support this action?"
    - "Are you ever forcing a character to act 'out of character' simply to make the plot work? How can the plot be adjusted OR the character's properties be *coherently modified* (via authenticated development) to resolve this?"
    - "How do character *limitations* force plot developments (e.g., needing to find an ally, needing to invent a new tool within world rules)?"

# --- V. Conclusion: Narrative as Emergent Property of a Constituted World ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    This protocol synthesizes the Doležel-inspired view that **narrative dynamics (plot) are intrinsically interwoven 
    with the static architecture of the heterocosm (entities, properties, relations, modalities, history, states)**. 
    Characters, defined by their **authenticated property bundles**, act as agents whose potential for action is 
    enabled and constrained by the **world's established rules and context**. Plot emerges as the **authenticated 
    sequence of events** resulting from these interactions within the **structured semantic network**.
  final_statement: |
    By meticulously ensuring that **character actions arise logically from their constituted nature** and that **plot events 
    adhere rigorously to the world's authenticated possibilities and limitations**, we achieve a profound level of 
    coherence. This approach treats plot not as an external force imposed upon a setting, but as an **emergent property 
    of the complex, dynamic system** that is the Aethelgard heterocosm. This deep integration between character, 
    action, and world structure is essential for creating narratives that are not only engaging but also possess 
    the **logical integrity and semantic richness** characteristic of masterfully constructed fictional realities. 
    The story unfolds *because* the world *is* what it is, and the characters *are* who they are, as legislated 
    by the linguistic forge.

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Character/Plot Integration:

Explicit Interplay Focus: The entire document is structured around the interaction between character constitution (property bundles) and narrative sequence (plot events).

Potential vs. Action: Section I requires analyzing how the static property bundle translates into dynamic narrative potential (what stories become possible due to this character's makeup).

Events as Authentication/Modification: Section II treats plot events rigorously as textual acts that both reveal existing properties and potentially authenticate changes to entity bundles or world states, demanding analysis of these changes.

Constraint Mapping: Section III requires detailed analysis of how specific world constraints (modal, historical, state-based) actively shape the possibilities for plot progression.

Rigorous Coherence Checks: Section IV focuses intensely on ensuring character actions always align with their authenticated properties, avoiding "plot-driven" inconsistencies. Demands justification or revision if clashes occur.

Systemic Language: Uses terms like "narrative potential," "operational logic," "emergent property," "dynamic system," "semantic architecture" consistently.

Detailed Prompts: Includes highly specific prompts forcing deep consideration of how character limits generate plot, how world rules enable/constrain specific narrative arcs, and how consistency is maintained between character nature and plot demands.

Theoretical Grounding: Continuously links the practical design considerations back to Doležel's core concepts (authentication, property bundles, modalities, coherence, heterocosm as system).

This extremely detailed YAML provides a robust framework for ensuring that the characters and plot within Aethelgard are not separate elements but are deeply intertwined, emerging logically from and consistently operating within the meticulously authenticated reality of the heterocosmic system.
