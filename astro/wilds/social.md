Okay, Artist of Worlds, here is a Markdown document template designed to help you meticulously define the **Social, Relational, and Categorical Properties** of entities within your story world. This protocol draws directly from the principles discussed in **"D. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties: Placing Entities in the System"** within Doležel's *Heterocosmica*.

The focus here is on moving beyond individual traits to define **how entities fit into the broader structures** of your heterocosm – their roles, statuses, affiliations, relationships, and classifications – recognizing these as crucial, authenticated properties that shape identity, function, and narrative potential.

## Introduction: Defining Entities within the Heterocosmic Network

*This protocol guides the definition of the **social, relational, and categorical properties** of entities within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, an entity's identity and function are significantly constituted by its **authenticated position within the world's established social, political, familial, cultural, and taxonomic systems**.*

*Use this document to explicitly define these extrinsic properties and connections for key entities. Focus on **authentication**: list only roles, statuses, affiliations, relationships, and classifications considered 'true' or factual *for this world*, citing the source. These properties link individual entities to the macro-level structure and drive social dynamics.*

### Social/Relational Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity arising from the entity's position within the world's networks.*

*   **Core Social/Relational Identity:** `[Summarize the entity's place based on its most defining affiliations, statuses, and relationships. e.g., Kaelen is constituted socially as an outsider navigating multiple conflicting systems: nominally an agent of Surface Order (City Watch - Low Status), but alienated from Guild power structures (Guildless, Exiled History Hint), forcing reliance on precarious alliances within the Undercity (Relation: Rust) that violate his official role (Deontic Conflict). His unknown lineage (Kinship Mystery) further isolates him while potentially linking him to the world's deepest secrets.]`
*   **Primary Narrative Functions Served by Position:** `[List key roles enabled/created by this positioning. e.g., Bridge between Surface and Undercity; Natural investigator of systemic corruption; Embodiment of social friction; Character whose personal quest (identity) intersects with world mysteries (legacy).]`
*   **Key Conflicts Arising from Position:** `[Identify conflicts generated *by* the entity's social/relational properties. e.g., Kaelen: Duty vs. Necessity (Watch vs. Undercity methods); Isolation vs. Need for Allies. Chronometers Guild: Conflict with other Guilds over authenticated control/resources.]`
*   **Potential for Change/Mobility:** `[Based on authenticated properties and world rules, what potential exists for change in status, affiliation, or key relationships? e.g., Can Kaelen regain Guild status? Can Undercity achieve political recognition? Is social mobility generally possible in Aethelgard?]`

**How This Markdown Document Guides Social/Relational Design:**

1.  **Focus on Extrinsic Identity:** Centers definition on the entity's place *within the system* – its roles, ranks, memberships, connections.
2.  **Taxonomic Clarity:** Uses Doležel's implied categories (Role, Status, Affiliation, Kinship, Type, Location, Cultural Perception) for systematic analysis.
3.  **Requires Authentication:** Demands that social positions and relationships are treated as **authenticated facts** of the heterocosm, not just vague associations.
4.  **Links to Macro-Structure:** Explicitly connects individual entity profiles to broader world structures like Guilds, social hierarchies, legal systems, and geography.
5.  **Highlights Conflict Potential:** Encourages identifying how an entity's specific position generates friction, conflict, or narrative opportunities within the established social/political landscape.
6.  **Integrates with Other Properties:** Shows how social/relational properties interact with functional (skills needed for role), psychological (beliefs shaped by affiliation), historical (status derived from past), and modal (obligations tied to role) properties.
7.  **Manages Undersaturation:** Requires noting undefined social/relational aspects, keeping the focus on the authenticated network.
8.  **Synthesizes Social Essence:** The summary section prompts articulation of the entity's core identity *as defined by its place within the world's web*.

By using this protocol, you ensure that the entities in Aethelgard are not just defined by their internal traits but are deeply embedded within a **richly textured and consistently authenticated social and relational network**, making the world feel more complex, dynamic, and socially believable.
