# Story World Codex: Systemic Integration & Network Mapping Protocol
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's World Fabric Synthesis)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly detailed framework** for the **holistic synthesis and critical 
    evaluation** of the Aethelgard heterocosm, focusing on how authenticated **properties AND relations** 
    intertwine to form the **fundamental fabric of its reality**. Building upon Doležel's conclusions, 
    this protocol moves beyond analyzing components in isolation to rigorously examine the **dynamic, 
    reciprocal interplay** between entity constitution (property bundles) and world structure (relational 
    networks), asserting that the world's coherence, richness, and meaning emerge precisely from this 
    **integrated semantic architecture**.
  scope: |
    Mandatory final integration check after defining core entities, properties, relations, modalities, 
    history, and states. Ensures the heterocosm functions as a **unified, dynamic system**, not merely 
    a collection of parts. Guides refinement to achieve maximum systemic integrity and narrative potential.
  ontological_premise: |
    The Aethelgard heterocosm **IS** the complex, multi-layered semantic network formed by **authenticated 
    entities (nodes) possessing authenticated property bundles AND interconnected by authenticated relations 
    (links)**. Neither properties nor relations alone constitute the world; its reality resides in their 
    **inseparable synthesis and consistent interplay** governed by established modalities.

# --- IV. Evaluating Systemic Coherence via Property-Relation Synthesis ---
# Purpose: Assess the overall logical integrity and believability of the heterocosm based on the consistent 
#          and plausible interplay of authenticated properties and relations.
systemic_coherence_synthesis:

  consistency_checkpoints:
    - checkpoint: "Functional Logic Across Network"
      question: "Do actions enabled by an entity's functional properties have consequences that respect the properties and relations of the entities they interact with, and the world's modalities?"
      assessment_example: "[e.g., Kaelen uses authenticated 'Temporal Sensitivity' (Func Prop) to detect an Aberration (Relation to Hazard). This detection allows him to use authenticated 'Containment Grenade' (Obj Func Prop) which functions according to established Alethic rules for Aberrations. -> Coherent Chain.]"
      potential_failure_example: "[e.g., Kaelen uses 'Temporal Sensitivity' to somehow *predict the future* (violates authenticated limits of ability and world's Epistemic Modality).]"
      action: "[Identify and resolve chains where properties/relations/modalities clash.]"

    - checkpoint: "Social Dynamics & Power Structures"
      question: "Do the depicted social interactions, power dynamics, and political maneuvers align consistently with the authenticated social/relational properties of the involved entities and factions, and the world's Deontic/Axiological framework?"
      assessment_example: "[e.g., Chronometers Guild consistently leveraging authenticated Dust control (Property/Relation) to influence Council decisions (Relation) aligns with established power structure.]"
      potential_failure_example: "[e.g., Low-status, Guildless character easily intimidates high-ranking Guild Master without authenticated leverage (e.g., secret knowledge, specific vulnerability).]"
      action: "[Ensure power dynamics are respected or deviations are strongly authenticated.]"

    - checkpoint: "Historical Resonance & Consistency"
      question: "Do the current properties and relations of entities plausibly reflect their authenticated historical properties and the established world history? Are historical legacies consistently manifested?"
      assessment_example: "[e.g., Current mistrust between Guilds (Relation) is consistently linked back to authenticated historical conflicts (Property of Factions).] "
      potential_failure_example: "[e.g., Entity described as ancient (Historical Prop) displays technology/attitudes inconsistent with its authenticated origin era without explanation.]"
      action: "[Strengthen links between past authentication and present constitution; resolve anachronisms.]"

  overall_integration_assessment: "[Rate: Seamlessly Integrated Fabric / Generally Woven / Contains Noticeable Snags / Structurally Unsound Network]"
  justification: "[Summarize how well properties and relations mutually constitute a believable and functional world system, highlighting strengths and weaknesses in their interplay.]"
  prompts:
    - "Identify a complex narrative event. Can you trace its causes and consequences through the network of authenticated entity properties and relations, respecting world modalities?"
    - "Where does the interaction between properties and relations feel most elegant and inevitable? Where does it feel most forced or coincidental?"

# --- V. Conclusion: The Woven Fabric - Reality Emerging from Interplay ---
conclusion:
  summary: |
    This protocol culminates the analysis of entity constitution by focusing on the **synthesis of properties and relations**. 
    It affirms the Doležel-inspired view that the rich, complex reality of the Aethelgard heterocosm emerges not from 
    isolated attributes or connections, but from their **dynamic, reciprocal interplay within a unified semantic network**. 
    Properties gain meaning through relational context; relations gain substance through the properties of the entities they connect.
  final_statement: |
    The **authenticated fabric of reality** in Aethelgard is woven from these interconnected threads of predication. 
    Its **coherence, richness, narrative potential, and thematic resonance** depend fundamentally on the **skillful 
    and consistent integration** of intrinsic entity nature (properties) with extrinsic systemic positioning (relations), 
    all operating within the framework of legislated world laws (modalities). Recognizing and meticulously designing 
    this **interwoven semantic architecture** is the key to forging a truly compelling and believable 'other world'. 
    The entity is its bundle; the world is the network; reality resides in their inseparable synthesis.

**How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Property/Relation Synthesis:**

1.  **Explicit Focus on Interplay:** Dedicates entire sections (II & III) specifically to mapping the *influence* of properties on relations and vice versa, demanding granular analysis of this dynamic.
2.  **Systemic Language:** Uses terms like "semantic network," "nodes," "links," "systemic integration," "feedback loops," "holistic," "ecosystem" to reinforce the interconnected view.
3.  **Detailed Examples Required:** While placeholders are used, the structure implies filling them with highly specific examples demonstrating the precise nature of the influence between properties and relations.
4.  **Multi-Step Causal Chains:** Encourages mapping complex interaction chains involving multiple systems (e.g., Physics -> Politics -> Economy -> Society) rather than simple one-to-one links.
5.  **Rigorous Coherence Checks:** Section IV focuses explicitly on checking the *consistency arising from the interplay*, looking for logical conflicts between how properties and relations function together.
6.  **Functional Justification:** Continuously prompts consideration of the *narrative and thematic function* served by specific interconnections.
7.  **Integration with Modalities:** Requires analyzing how the property/relation network operates *within* and *respects* the established world modalities.
8.  **Concluding Synthesis:** The final conclusion powerfully summarizes the core idea: the world's reality *is* this interwoven fabric, emphasizing the inseparability of properties and relations.

This extremely detailed YAML template provides a robust framework for analyzing and designing the deep structural coherence of Aethelgard, ensuring that its entities are not just well-defined in isolation, but function as fully integrated components within a complex, dynamic, and meaningful semantic network.
