## Introduction: Assessing the Completed Entity Sculpture

*This protocol guides the final synthesis and evaluation of key entities within the [Your Story World Name] heterocosm, reflecting on Doležel's conclusion about achieving complexity through a **rich palette of authenticated properties**. Having defined entities through various property categories (Physical, Functional, Psychological, Social, Modal, Axiological, Historical), this protocol assesses the **success of their integration into a multifaceted whole**.*

*The goal is to confirm that key entities are not one-dimensional but possess **believable complexity arising from the diverse, interconnected, and coherently authenticated bundle** of properties assigned to them. It validates that language has been effectively used as a "Master Sculptor" to forge compelling fictional beings.*

### I. Evaluation of Multifaceted Constitution (Breadth Across Palette)

*Purpose: Assess whether the entity is defined across a sufficiently diverse range of property categories pertinent to its type and narrative role.*

*   **Checklist of Dimensions (Assess Presence & Significance):**
    *   `[X]` **Physical Properties:** Is its tangible form/sensory signature clearly and evocatively authenticated?
        *   *Notes:* `[e.g., Yes, strong visual and auditory signature defined, consistent with Noir/Steampunk tone.]`
    *   `[X]` **Functional Properties:** Are its key capabilities AND limitations clearly authenticated and narratively relevant?
        *   *Notes:* `[e.g., Core investigative skills defined, but physical/combat limitations also clear, creating realistic constraints.]`
    *   `[X]` **Psychological Properties (If Sentient):** Does it possess a coherent bundle of authenticated traits, motivations, beliefs, and emotional dispositions?
        *   *Notes:* `[e.g., Yes, core cynicism, drive for truth, and trauma-linked sensitivity are well-established through authenticated examples.]`
    *   `[X]` **Social/Relational Properties:** Is its position within the world's social/political networks clearly authenticated (role, status, key relationships)?
        *   *Notes:* `[e.g., Role as outsider Watchman interacting with Guilds and Undercity is central and clearly defined.]`
    *   `[ ]` **Modal Properties:** Does it possess any *unique* authenticated status regarding world laws (immortality, fate, special obligations)? *(Note: Not all entities require unique modal properties)*.
        *   *Notes:* `[e.g., Kaelen possesses unique 'Temporal Sensitivity' - qualifies as a minor unique Alethic property.]`
    *   `[X]` **Axiological Properties:** Is its value status (moral, aesthetic, utilitarian) clearly authenticated within the world's system or through consistent perception by others?
        *   *Notes:* `[e.g., Value as 'Truth-Seeker' implicitly positive in narrative framing, contrasting with negative perception by controlling factions.]`
    *   `[X]` **Historical Properties:** Is its connection to the authenticated past (origins, key experiences, legacy) sufficiently defined to provide context and depth?
        *   *Notes:* `[e.g., Amnesia IS the defining historical property, strongly authenticated. Hints of deeper Artificer connection provide necessary mystery.]`

*   **Overall Assessment of Multifacetedness:** `[Rate: Highly Multifaceted / Moderately Multifaceted / Somewhat One-Dimensional / Flat]`
    *   *Justification:* `[e.g., Kaelen is defined strongly across nearly all relevant dimensions, making him feel complex and well-integrated into the world's various systems.]`
*   **Refinement Needed?** `[e.g., Could benefit from slightly more defined Axiological standing according to specific factional views.]`

*   **# Reflection Prompt:** *Does this entity feel like it truly *exists* across multiple dimensions within Aethelgard, or does it feel defined primarily by only one or two aspects (e.g., just its function, just its appearance)?*

## II. Evaluation of Internal Coherence & Integration within the Bundle

*Purpose: Assess whether the diverse authenticated properties constituting the entity form a logically consistent and integrated whole.*

*   **Consistency Check: Intra-Bundle Logic:**
    *   `Are there any direct contradictions between authenticated properties within the bundle (e.g., authenticated as physically weak but consistently performs feats of great strength without explanation)?`
    *   `Assessment:* `[e.g., No direct contradictions found for Kaelen. His physical limits align with his functional reliance on wit/investigation.]`
*   **Consistency Check: Alignment with World Modalities:**
    *   `Do all authenticated properties (especially Functional & Modal) align with the overarching Modalities established for Aethelgard (as documented in relevant Codex sections)?`
    *   `Assessment:* `[e.g., Kaelen's temporal sensitivity, while unique, operates within the established *limits* of such sensitivity (causes sickness, doesn't allow prediction). His actions adhere to baseline human alethic limits.]`
*   **Plausibility of Interplay:**
    *   `Do the interactions between different property types feel logical and plausible *within this world*? (e.g., Does psychological trauma plausibly explain functional limitations? Does social status grant realistic functional permissions? Does historical origin justify unique physical traits?)`
    *   `Assessment:* `[e.g., Yes, Kaelen's cynicism (Psychological) plausibly stems from his amnesia/world exposure (Historical/Contextual) and influences his interactions (Social). His Watch status (Social) grants specific access (Functional) but is limited by Guild power (Political State).]`
*   **Internal Conflicts (Coherent Complexity):**
    *   `Where internal tensions exist within the bundle (e.g., conflicting motivations, desire vs. limitation), are these tensions *authenticated* and presented as part of the entity's complexity, rather than as inconsistencies?`
    *   `Assessment:* `[e.g., Kaelen's conflict between cynical distrust and obsessive truth-seeking is consistently authenticated and drives his character arc, adding depth, not incoherence.]`

*   **Overall Coherence Judgment:** `[Rate: Highly Coherent Bundle / Mostly Coherent / Some Minor Tensions Need Clarification / Contains Significant Internal Inconsistencies]`
    *   *Justification:* `[e.g., Kaelen's property bundle demonstrates strong internal coherence, with different facets logically supporting or creating believable tension with each other.]`
*   **Refinement Needed?** `[e.g., Clarify the exact mechanism/limits of the 'Temporal Sensitivity' property to ensure its application remains fully consistent with Alethic rules.]`

*   **# Reflection Prompt:** *Does this entity feel like a unified whole, even if complex or conflicted? Or does it feel like a collection of disconnected traits? Where might the internal logic of its constitution be strengthened?*

## III. Evaluation of Perceived "Depth" Arising from the Bundle

*Purpose: Assess how the authenticated property bundle contributes to the subjective experience of depth, complexity, or "roundness".*

*   **Source of Depth: Multifacetedness:**
    *   `Does the sheer *breadth* of definition across different property categories contribute significantly to its perceived depth?`
    *   *Assessment:* `[e.g., Yes, being defined physically, functionally, psychologically, socially, and historically makes Kaelen feel more 'real' and complex than if only his detective function were detailed.]`
*   **Source of Depth: Internal Tensions:**
    *   `Do the *authenticated internal conflicts* within the property bundle (see II above) create a sense of psychological depth and believable struggle?`
    *   *Assessment:* `[e.g., Yes, the conflict between his drive for truth and his inherent cynicism/distrust is a major source of his perceived depth.]`
*   **Source of Depth: Connection to Rich Context:**
    *   `Does the entity's deep integration with the world's complex *history, society, and unique rules* (via its Historical, Social, Modal properties) lend it contextual depth?`
    *   *Assessment:* `[e.g., Yes, Kaelen's significance is amplified because his personal mystery is directly tied to Aethelgard's core historical mysteries and power structures.]`
*   **Source of Depth: Strategic Undersaturation:**
    *   `Do the *intentionally undefined* aspects (e.g., Kaelen's full past, the exact nature of his flashes) contribute to a sense of mystery and potential ('hidden depths'), inviting audience interpretation?`
    *   *Assessment:* `[e.g., Yes, the core amnesia creates immense perceived depth by suggesting a vast, unknown history waiting to be discovered, leveraging undersaturation effectively.]`
*   **Source of Depth: Dynamic Potential:**
    *   `Does the property bundle allow for plausible and meaningful **character development** (authentication of changes/additions to the bundle over time)?`
    *   *Assessment:* `[e.g., The established internal conflicts and undersaturated past provide clear potential for future development and changes to Kaelen's psychological and historical properties.]`

*   **Overall "Roundness" Assessment:** `[Rate: Feels Very Round / Moderately Round / Somewhat Flat / Flat]`
    *   *Justification:* `[e.g., Kaelen feels like a 'round' character due to the combination of diverse authenticated properties, significant internal conflict, deep integration with world context, and strategic use of undersaturation regarding his past.]`
*   **Refinement Needed?** `[e.g., Could add minor authenticated habits or preferences (Psychological/Physical) to add texture without altering core complexity.]`

*   **# Reflection Prompt:** *Why does this entity *feel* complex or simple? Can you trace that feeling directly back to the specific properties (or lack thereof) authenticated for it across the different categories? How does its incompleteness contribute to its perceived depth?*

## IV. Affirmation of Linguistic Constitution

*Purpose: To consciously reaffirm that the entity's entire perceived reality is a product of the skillful application of language.*

*   **Linguistic Craft:** `[Acknowledge the role of specific word choices, descriptive techniques, narrative voice, and authenticated dialogue in constituting this entity's multifaceted reality. e.g., The use of noir-inflected language in describing Kaelen's internal state directly authenticates his psychological properties. The precise technical language used for Chrono-Tech defines its functional properties.]`
*   **Textual Boundaries:** `[Reaffirm understanding that this entity, however complex it feels, exists *only* as constituted by its authenticated textual properties within the Aethelgard heterocosm, as documented in the Codex and narratives.]`
*   **Success of the "Sculpture":** `[Provide a final assessment of how successfully language (the 'Master Sculptor') has forged this entity into a coherent, complex, and resonant being. e.g., Language successfully constitutes Kaelen as a compelling, multifaceted entity perfectly suited to navigate and embody the core conflicts and themes of Aethelgard.]`

*   **# Reflection Prompt:** *How did specific linguistic choices made during design directly contribute to the entity's perceived complexity or depth? Where was language most effective in constituting its reality?*

## Conclusion: Celebrating the Rich Palette

*This review confirms that the entity [Entity Name/ID] achieves complexity and depth not through an assumed similarity to real-world beings, but through the **richness, diversity, and coherent integration of its textually authenticated property bundle**. By defining its existence across multiple dimensions – physical, functional, psychological, social, modal, axiological, and historical – the authoritative narrative discourse has successfully sculpted a multifaceted entity.*

*This process exemplifies the principle that even within the necessary limits of **textual undersaturation**, language possesses the expressive power to forge intricate and compelling fictional beings. The perceived 'roundness' or depth of this entity is affirmed as a direct result of **skillful semantic architecture**, demonstrating the creative achievement inherent in mastering the rich palette of fictional being.*
