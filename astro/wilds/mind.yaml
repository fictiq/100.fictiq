# Story World Codex: Sentient Entity Psychological Profile Protocol
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Constituting Interiority)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly granular framework** for the meticulous constitution 
    of the **psychological and mental properties (the 'interiority')** of sentient entities within 
    the Aethelgard heterocosm. Applying Doležel's core principle that entities ARE bundles of 
    authenticated properties, this protocol focuses exclusively on defining the **textually validated 
    cognitive, affective, motivational, and belief structures** that constitute an entity's inner world.
  scope: |
    Mandatory template for defining the psychological makeup of all significant sentient canonical entities 
    (persons, sufficiently complex automatons, sentient creatures, deities). Ensures nuanced, consistent 
    characterization grounded in textual evidence, avoiding naive psychologism while enabling complex 
    internal landscapes.
  ontological_premise: |
    An entity's "mind" or "psyche" within Aethelgard exists **only** as the sum total of its authenticated 
    psychological properties. There is **no assumed subconscious, hidden essence, or untracked internal state** 
    beyond what is textually constituted via authoritative predication (direct statement, reliable inference 
    from action/dialogue, consistent pattern). Undefined psychological aspects **do not exist** for the entity 
    within the heterocosm. Coherence requires consistent manifestation of these properties.

  # --- Psychological Constitution Summary & Narrative Function ---
  psychological_constitution_summary:
    purpose: "Synthesize the core psychological identity, internal conflicts, and narrative function emerging from the authenticated mental/emotional property bundle."
    core_psychological_essence: |
      [Provide a rich summary synthesizing the most defining psychological traits and their interplay. e.g., 
      "Ticker (Unit 734) is constituted psychologically by a baseline of **programmed logical processing and archival duty** (COG/MOT). 
      However, this is increasingly disrupted by **authenticated memory glitches and an emergent, innocent curiosity** (COG/TRAIT) 
      about illogical data (human behavior, inconsistencies). Its core internal conflict arises from its **drive for logical 
      consistency clashing with paradoxical input and directives** (MOT/FLAW). While lacking authenticated emotion, 
      its persistent questioning and literalism (COG/FLAW) give it a unique pathos and make it a crucial node for 
      exploring themes of **Consciousness, Memory, and Order vs. Emergence** within Aethelgard's mechanistic worldview."]
    primary_narrative_functions_psychological: "[e.g., Provide unique perspective (non-human logic); Drive plots related to AI/Consciousness; Expose world inconsistencies through naive questioning; Act as foil to more cynical human characters; Embody thematic tensions.]"
    key_internal_conflicts_psychological: "[Identify conflicts *within* the psychological bundle: e.g., Duty vs. Curiosity (Ticker); Cynicism vs. Buried Idealism (Kaelen); Fear vs. Duty; Conflicting Beliefs.]"
    potential_for_development_psychological: "[Based on authenticated properties and undersaturation, where is psychological growth/change plausible? e.g., Ticker developing greater understanding beyond logic; Kaelen recovering memories leading to identity shift.]"

How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Psychological Properties:

Rigorous Ontology Statement: The Introduction and ontological_premise leave absolutely no room for assumptions about hidden depths, grounding everything in authenticated textual evidence as per Doležel.

Granular Categorization & Sub-Categories: Breaks down Psychology into highly specific facets (Traits, Emotions, Cognition, Beliefs, Motivations, Memory, Flaws) with further sub-points (e.g., Core vs. Secondary Traits, Baseline Affect vs. Triggers).

Emphasis on Manifestation & Evidence: Requires defining how each internal trait manifests observably/audibly within the text and citing the specific authentication evidence.

Nuance & Interaction Fields: Includes fields for noting nuance within traits and explicitly analyzing trait_interactions and hierarchy/conflict of motivations, pushing for complex character dynamics.

Detailed Memory Constitution: Treats memory not just as backstory but as a complex psychological property with specific content and an explicitly defined accuracy_status (crucial for Aethelgard's themes).

Distinction Between Subjective & Objective: Carefully maintains the distinction between a character's authenticated belief or subjective experience and the objective reality of the heterocosm.

Exhaustive Undersaturation Notes: Requires explicitly identifying undefined aspects for each psychological category, forcing conscious design of what remains unknown about the character's inner world.

Deep Prompts: Includes highly specific prompts designed to interrogate the function, consistency, and thematic relevance of each psychological property within the Aethelgard context.

Sophisticated Synthesis: The summary demands articulating the character's psychological essence, narrative function, internal conflicts, and developmental potential as emergent properties of the entire authenticated bundle.

This extremely detailed YAML template guides the creator in constructing the interiority of sentient entities with meticulous care, ensuring that their thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and motivations are not vague assumptions but are precisely defined, textually grounded, and functionally integrated components of the Aethelgard heterocosm, consistent with the rigorous demands of Doležel's semantic framework.
