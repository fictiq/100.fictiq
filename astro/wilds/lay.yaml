# Story World Codex: Entity Modal Properties Protocol
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Embedded World Laws)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly granular framework** for the meticulous definition 
    of **Modal Properties** assigned to specific entities within the Aethelgard heterocosm. 
    Building upon Doležel's theory, it focuses on how the fundamental governing laws (modalities) 
    of the world can be **directly embedded onto or uniquely modified for individual entities** 
    through explicit, authenticated predication. This defines their exceptional status regarding 
    possibility, necessity, obligation, value, or knowledge.
  scope: |
    Mandatory template for defining the unique modal constitution of all significant canonical entities 
    possessing properties that deviate from or specify baseline world modalities (e.g., immortals, 
    fated beings, uniquely bound entities, inherently sacred/profane objects, epistemically privileged/
    limited creatures). Ensures these exceptional statuses are rigorously defined, consistently applied, 
    and functionally integrated into the world system.
  ontological_premise: |
    An entity's modal properties ARE core components of its authenticated property bundle, defining its 
    fundamental relationship to the possibilities and constraints of its heterocosm. They require 
    **unambiguous authentication** from authoritative sources and must cohere with the overall modal 
    architecture, even when representing exceptions.

          limitations_vulnerabilities: |
            - **IS vulnerable** to direct application of concentrated, raw Paradox energy (causes structural decoherence).
            - **IS vulnerable** to specific deactivation sequences encoded in its core programming (Epistemic/Functional interaction).
            - **IS NOT** immune to indirect environmental effects (e.g., being trapped in a collapsing structure).
          world_law_interaction: "Represents a specific, authenticated exception to standard mortality and material vulnerability rules, justified by its unique (e.g., Artificer) origin."
          narrative_function: "Creates 'invincible' seeming obstacle requiring specific knowledge/tools to overcome; establishes high stakes; reinforces power of Paradox/Artificer knowledge."

            - **DOES NOT** imply invulnerability or preclude failure in *other* unrelated actions.
            - **DOES NOT** necessarily negate subjective free will, but creates strong 'currents' of probability.
            - The *outcome* of the Fated Event itself might still be ambiguous or dependent on choices *at the event*.
          world_law_interaction: "Represents localized perturbation of standard causality/probability; interacts complexly with 'No True Time Travel' rule (cannot easily *prevent* the fate, but might influence *how* it unfolds)."
          narrative_function: "Drives overarching plot; creates dramatic irony/tension; explores Free Will vs. Determinism theme; motivates factions seeking to control/eliminate the entity."
          authentication_source: "[e.g., Codex_Prophecy_Convergence, Analysis from CHAR_Oracle_Silas, Consistent narrative 'near misses' or 'coincidences' framed authoritatively.]"

            - Requires **specific trigger** (e.g., high ambient Chrono-Dust, direct threat perception).
            - **Cannot interact physically** while phased.
            - **IS vulnerable** to authenticated temporal stabilization fields *during* the phase shift.
            - Phase state may leave detectable **temporal residue/echoes**.

          scope_effect: |
            - Overrides any conflicting orders or self-preservation instincts.
            - Defines 'unauthorized intruder' based on specific authenticated criteria (e.g., lacking Key Artifact, specific genetic marker).
            - Compulsion is absolute; circumvention requires exploiting definition of 'unauthorized' or 'protection', not breaking the geas itself.

            - Can refuse to answer, speak in riddles, omit crucial context, or state subjective truths/interpretations.

      (rumored power source capable of stabilizing time - exception to normal decay/instability) and **inherent positive 
      axiological status** (repels Aberrations, inspires hope - aligned with Order). Its primary **alethic constraint** 
      is its unknown/difficult activation method (epistemic/functional limit), and its **deontic status** is highly 
      contested (possession forbidden by some factions, quest object for others). Its existence fundamentally challenges 
      Aethelgard's established limits."]

    key_interactions_with_general_modalities: "[How does it interact with standard world rules? e.g., Its stability contrasts with general temporal instability; Its power potentially bypasses standard energy costs but risks unique paradoxes; Its sacredness creates specific social/political reactions based on world axiology.]"
    consistency_check_summary: "[Confirm consistent application of its unique modal properties. e.g., Does it always repel Aberrations? Are activation difficulties consistently portrayed?]"
    potential_for_conflict_exploitation: "[How can its modal properties be used/misused? e.g., Factions fighting for control; attempts to replicate its power; using its aura defensively; ethical dilemmas around activating its potentially world-altering power.]"

# --- End of Entity Modal Profile ---


How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Modal Properties:

Explicit Focus on Modality: Dedicates the entire protocol specifically to properties defining an entity's relationship to world laws (Possibility, Obligation, Value, Knowledge).

Granular Breakdown within Modalities: Separates Alethic, Deontic, Axiological, and Epistemic properties into distinct sections with detailed fields.

Emphasis on Interaction with World Law: Requires explicitly stating how the entity's unique modal property interacts with or serves as an exception to the general modalities of the heterocosm.

Detailed Scope & Limitations: Demands precise definition of the scope, intensity, triggers, limitations, vulnerabilities, consequences, and operational parameters associated with each modal property. Avoids vague "is immortal."

Narrative Function Justification: Requires articulating the specific narrative purpose served by granting an entity this exceptional modal status.

Rigorous Authentication Requirement: Stresses the need for strong, unambiguous authentication for these often foundational or exceptional properties.

Deep Prompts for Nuance: Includes prompts pushing for consideration of specific scenarios, interactions between modalities, and the precise nature of limitations or inherent knowledge.

Structured Synthesis: Requires a detailed summary articulating the entity's modal identity and its function arising specifically from this unique relationship to world rules.

Distinction from Perceived Value: Explicitly distinguishes inherent Axiological modal properties (rare, tied to cosmology) from the more common perceived value/reputation (covered in the Social/Relational protocol).

This extremely detailed YAML template provides a rigorous framework for designing and documenting entities with unique modal statuses within Aethelgard. It ensures these exceptions feel like integral, well-defined parts of the world's logic, rather than arbitrary plot devices, thereby strengthening the overall coherence and depth of the heterocosm.
