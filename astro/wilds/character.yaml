# Story World Codex: Fictional Person Constitution Protocol
# Version: 1.1 (Extreme Detail - Based on Doležel's Character Ontology)
# Last Updated: [Current Date]
# Keeper of the Codex / Central Authority Secretariat: [Specify Role/Name]
# World: Aethelgard
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol provides an **advanced, highly granular framework** for the meticulous constitution 
    of **Fictional Persons** (characters and other sufficiently sentient entities) within the Aethelgard 
    heterocosm. It rigorously applies Doležel's ontological principle: characters **ARE** nothing more 
    or less than **complex, multifaceted bundles of properties and relations authenticated by the 
    authoritative narrative discourse**. 
  scope: |
    Mandatory template for defining all significant canonical sentient entities. Ensures deep, consistent 
    characterization grounded solely in textual/Codex evidence, explicitly rejecting naive psychologism 
    or assumptions of extra-textual reality. Focuses on building perceived depth through the richness, 
    coherence, and internal tensions of the authenticated bundle.
  ontological_premise: |
    Fictional Persons in Aethelgard possess **no independent consciousness, subconscious, soul, or 
    hidden essence** beyond the sum total of their authenticated properties. Their 'inner life' IS 
    their authenticated psychological bundle; their 'agency' IS their authenticated functional potential 
    operating within authenticated world constraints. Undersaturation is a fundamental feature.

    # --- 4. Social/Relational/Categorical Constitution ---
    # (Reference detailed Social Protocol/Codex Section, summarize key defining elements here)
    social_relational_categorical_constitution:
      title: "Authenticated Position within Aethelgard's Networks"
      summary: |
        [Summarize the entity's key authenticated roles, statuses, affiliations, significant relationships, 
        and type classifications, emphasizing how these position the entity within the world's power 
        structures and social fabric. e.g., "Kaelen is defined by his outsider status: a Guildless City Watch 
        Investigator operating with limited formal power but unique access potential due to his Undercity 
        connections (REL_KAE_Rust) and mysterious past. His primary social friction arises from his necessary 
        interaction with powerful, secretive Guild structures (REL_KAE_CG/MK) from a position of social and 
        epistemic disadvantage."]
      key_defining_elements: "[List 2-3 most crucial social/relational properties determining their narrative function.]"
      prompts:
        - "How does their social position *directly enable or constrain* their authenticated functional properties?"
        - "Which relationship is most crucial in defining their possibilities and conflicts?"

    # --- 5. Modal Constitution (Unique Status Regarding World Laws) ---
    # (Reference detailed Modal Protocol/Codex Section, summarize key elements here)
    modal_constitution:
      title: "Authenticated Relationship to Fundamental World Laws"
      summary: |
        [Summarize any *unique* authenticated modal properties. e.g., "Kaelen possesses a unique, authenticated 
        Alethic/Epistemic sensitivity to temporal flux beyond baseline humans, though its full potential and 
        limits remain partially undersaturated. He is otherwise subject to standard Aethelgard modalities. 
        Ticker operates under standard Automaton modal constraints (Deontic obedience, Alethic tech limits). 
        Vance possesses no unique personal modal properties but wields significant power *through* her control 
        over entities/tech governed by world modalities."]
      key_defining_elements: "[List any property granting unique possibility, necessity, obligation, value, or knowledge status.]"
      prompts:
        - "Does this entity represent a significant *exception* to Aethelgard's general rules? How is that exception justified and constrained?"
        - "How does their modal status impact their interactions with 'normal' entities or world systems?"

    # --- 6. Axiological Constitution (Authenticated Value/Reputation Profile) ---
    # (Reference detailed Axiological Protocol/Codex Section, summarize key elements here)
    axiological_constitution:
      title: "Authenticated Value and Reputation within Heterocosm"
      summary: |
        [Summarize the entity's value status based on authenticated world systems and perceptions. e.g., 
        "Kaelen's axiological status is contested: valued for his results by some in the Watch, distrusted 
        as unpredictable by Guilds, seen as potentially useful but ultimately 'Surface' by Undercity. 
        Narrative framing implicitly values his pursuit of truth. Ticker holds primarily utilitarian value, 
        with its potential emergence viewed with fear/scientific curiosity. Vance is valued positively 
        (power/stability) by her faction, negatively (ruthless control) by rivals."]
      key_defining_elements: "[List key authenticated reputations or symbolic values.]"
      prompts:
        - "How does the world's judgment of this character (authenticated) align with or contrast against their authenticated internal psychology or actions?"
        - "What conflicts arise from differing axiological assessments of this character by different factions?"

    # --- 7. Historical Constitution (Authenticated Links to Past) ---
    # (Reference detailed Historical Protocol/Codex Section, summarize key elements here)
    historical_constitution:
      title: "Authenticated Origins and Embedded History"
      summary: |
        [Summarize the entity's authenticated connection to the past. e.g., 
        "Kaelen's defining historical property is the **authenticated absence** of personal history (amnesia), 
        making his present a direct consequence of this historical void and linking him intrinsically to the 
        world's core mysteries regarding memory and potentially the Artificers (via flashes). Ticker's history 
        is recent and documented but potentially contains corrupted legacy data. Vance's historical properties 
        link her to Guild lineage and past power struggles, potentially including involvement in the First Paradox event."]
      key_defining_elements: "[List key authenticated origins, past experiences, or legacies shaping the present entity.]"
      prompts:
        - "How does the *known* authenticated past explain the entity's *present* authenticated properties (skills, flaws, motivations)?"
        - "How does the *unknown* or *contested* authenticated history create narrative drive or thematic resonance?"

  # --- Synthesis: Entity Essence Profile (Final Integration) ---
  entity_essence_profile_final:
    purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, systemic function, internal tensions, and narrative potential emerging from the **complete, integrated, multifaceted property bundle**."
    core_essence_statement_detailed: |
      [Provide a rich, nuanced summary demonstrating how ALL property dimensions integrate. e.g., 
      "Investigator Kaelen IS constituted as a complex node within the Aethelgard semantic network, primarily 
      defined by the **ontological void of his authenticated historical properties (amnesia)** which directly 
      fuels his **core psychological motivator (identity quest)**. His **functional properties** (deduction, 
      temporal sensitivity) make him uniquely capable of navigating the world's **epistemically challenging 
      reality**, while his **physical/functional limitations** (average strength, tech dependence) and **social 
      status** (Guildless Watchman) create necessary constraints and narrative friction. His **psychological 
      bundle** (cynicism vs. truth-drive vs. trauma flashes) generates internal conflict reflecting the world's 
      **axiological tensions** (Order vs. Truth) and **modal realities** (unreliable memory/time). His **relational 
      properties** place him precariously between competing factions (Watch, Undercity, Guilds), forcing difficult 
      choices aligned with the world's **deontic complexities**. His entire being embodies the core themes of 
      Memory, Identity, and Truth within a decaying, rule-bound yet chaotic system."]
    primary_systemic_narrative_role: "[Define role with nuance: e.g., Not just 'protagonist', but 'Catalyst for revealing historical/political truth through navigation of epistemic constraints', 'Embodiment of identity crisis reflecting world state'.]"
    key_bundle_tensions_dynamics: "[Detail specific conflicts arising from the interplay of *different property types*: e.g., Functional ability vs. Physical limitation; Psychological desire vs. Social prohibition; Historical trauma vs. Present duty; Modal sensitivity vs. Epistemic uncertainty.]"
    undersaturation_as_potential: "[Specify how the *defined limits* of the bundle (undersaturation) purposefully create potential for: Character development (filling psychological/historical gaps); Plot reveals (uncovering hidden relations/histories); Thematic ambiguity (unresolved ontological questions about consciousness/memory).]"

# --- End of Character Profile ---


How this YAML Embodies "Extreme Detail" for Character Constitution:

Rigorous Ontological Framing: Starts and ends by explicitly grounding the character in Doležel's text-centric, property-bundle ontology, rejecting external analogies.

Deep Taxonomic Breakdown: Uses all relevant property categories with detailed sub-points and prompts demanding specific, nuanced authentication for each facet of the character's being.

Emphasis on Authentication Source/Method: Continuously requires citation and consideration of how a property is validated within the text (direct statement, action pattern, reliable dialogue, etc.).

Focus on Internal Coherence & Conflict: Demands analysis of consistency within the property bundle and explicitly identifies internal conflicts arising from the combination of different authenticated properties.

Detailed Functional Analysis: Breaks down capabilities and limitations with fields for scope, intensity, triggers, consequences, ensuring functional properties are meticulously defined.

Nuanced Psychology: Requires detailed authentication of traits, emotions, beliefs, motivations, and subjective memory content, while strictly adhering to textual limits (no external psychoanalysis).

Systemic Integration: Explicitly links character properties back to world modalities, history, social structures, and themes throughout.

Strategic Undersaturation Management: Treats undersaturation not as a lack, but as a defined boundary and potential narrative tool, requiring conscious management.

Highly Specific Prompts: Includes numerous prompts designed to force deep consideration of the nuances, implications, and consistency of each authenticated property within the Aethelgard context.

Sophisticated Synthesis: The final summary demands a highly integrated articulation of the character's essence as emerging from the entire complex bundle, defining their systemic role and potential based purely on their authenticated textual constitution.

This extremely detailed YAML provides a comprehensive and theoretically rigorous framework for constructing fictional characters as multifaceted semantic entities, ensuring their depth and complexity arise organically from their carefully authenticated properties and relations within the specific reality of the Aethelgard heterocosm.
