# Codex Philosophy: A living document built on Doležel's ontology, focusing on 
#                   authenticated properties & relations. This version emphasizes 
#                   evocative, marvelous sensory details as core constitutive elements 
#                   to maximize creative inspiration and world immersion.
# ============================================================

# --- Introduction ---
introduction:
  purpose: |
    This protocol guides the definition of entities within the Aethelgard heterocosm. 
    Entities are constituted by the bundle of properties and relations explicitly 
    **authenticated** within the narrative framework. This version places special 
    emphasis on incorporating **marvelous and specific sensory details** as core 
    properties, recognizing their power to create immersion, atmosphere, unique 
    characterization, and evocative world-building.
  focus_note: |
    Sensory details are **authenticated properties**, not mere flavor. Focus on details 
    unique to Aethelgard's Chrono-Noir Steampunk reality (temporal distortions, 
    clockwork intricacies, atmospheric decay, memory echoes). Use comments `#` for 
    speculation, subjective character perceptions, or unauthenticated ideas.

        # --- Tactile Prompt ---
        # Prompt: Imagine touching it – what surprises you? Is it uniform? Does the feel match the look? How does its presence affect the physical 'feel' of the immediate environment?

      atmospheric_impact:
        - property: "Air Quality Effect: [e.g., Air becomes visibly distorted, shimmering like heat haze; Creates localized fog banks smelling of brine and regret; Seems to suck the warmth and sound out of the immediate area]"

        - property: "Subjective Temporal Effect: [e.g., Induces mild vertigo or déjà vu in observers; Nearby clocks visibly stutter or run erratically; Causes a lingering feeling that moments are 'missing' after exposure]"
          # Authentication: [Source]
        # --- Atmospheric Prompt ---

How this YAML Uses Maximum Imaginative Capabilities (Examples within the Structure):

Hyper-Specific Details: Instead of just "metal skin," it suggests "Skin like aged parchment, etched with faint, glowing circuits" or "Skin possesses a subtle, oily sheen like aged mother-of-pearl." Instead of "makes noise," it suggests "Accompanied by soft whirring and clicking of internal mechanisms" or "Creates a cascade of fine sand-like sounds as Chrono-Dust sheds from its form."

Cross-Sensory Connections: It prompts linking function to sensory output (e.g., ability creates shimmering field + high-pitched whine). It considers how psychology manifests sensorially (e.g., anxiety = audible clicking).

World-Specific Sensations: It introduces concepts unique to Aethelgard, like the smell of ozone near temporal rifts, the visual stuttering or ghosting, the tactile feeling of temporal drag, the sound of the Shattered Moon, the taste of Chrono-Dust.

Atmospheric Focus: The "Atmospheric/Ambient Sensory Impact" and "Sensory Signature Profile" sections push beyond direct senses to the overall feeling and presence of an entity, using evocative language like "charged air," "unnatural shadow," "feeling of profound age," "cacophony... mixed with despair."

Subjectivity Acknowledged: While focusing on authenticated properties, it allows for noting subjective sensory experiences of characters (e.g., desaturated vision due to trauma, perceiving emotions as scents), adding psychological depth.

"Marvelous" Elements: Includes details designed to evoke wonder or strangeness: eyes like camera shutters glowing with starlight, shadows moving independently, time moss, reflecting glimpses of a different sky, sounds causing teeth to ache, smells triggering memories.

Rich Prompts: The # - Prompt: comments are designed to push the creator further, asking provocative questions tailored to evoking unique sensory details within the Aethelgard context.

This expanded YAML serves as both a rigorous organizational tool (respecting the Doležel-inspired structure) and a powerful creative stimulant, packed with imaginative examples and prompts designed to help you build the truly marvelous sensory reality of Aethelgard.
