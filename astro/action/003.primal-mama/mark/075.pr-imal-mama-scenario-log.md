Okay, let's recontextualize the Pr imal Mama quest YAML file using the structure and concepts of the **Entity Functional Profile Protocol**. This version will analyze the quest flow  by highlighting the **functions, capabilities, constraints, and interactions** of the involved entities (Runner/Player, NPCs,  Creatures, Objects, Environment) as they manifest during the scenario.

## Introduction: Scenario  as Functional Testbed

*This document analyzes the "Lickskillet Hustle" scenario sequence through the lens of  Entity Functional Profiles. It examines how the **Runner's authenticated functional properties** (capabilities, skills, limitations) are  applied to interact with, overcome, or utilize the functional properties of other entities (NPCs, creatures, objects) and environmental  constraints within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Each quest step is viewed as an instance of functional interaction, governed by the  world's established modalities.*

## III. Functional Profile Summary of Scenario

*The "Lickskillet Hustle" scenario  effectively tests and utilizes a broad range of the Runner's core functional properties. Key capabilities demonstrated include:*
    *   * Mobility (Swimming, Climbing, Skiff Operation)*
    *   *Combat (Melee, Ranged, against  various creature types and humanoids)*
    *   *Investigation (Perception, Tracking, Clue Analysis, Item  Interaction)*
    *   *Social Interaction (Dialogue, Inquiry, Persuasion/Intimidation, Negotiation/Bri bery)*
    *   *Technical Interaction (Scanning, Interfacing, Repair/Mechanical Operation)*
    *   *Decision  Making (Dialogue choices, Moral choices, Tactical choices)*

*The scenario also highlights the importance of **Constraints** (environmental  hazards, locked objects, skill checks, timed responses, entity vulnerabilities/resistances) and **Dependencies** (need for specific gear like  Hazard Suits or Electro-Prods). The interplay between the Runner's functions and the functions/constraints of the encountered  entities and environment drives the narrative progression and challenge.*

*Successfully navigating this scenario requires the Runner entity to possess or develop a versatile  functional profile, capable of adapting to diverse challenges presented by the Primal Mama world.*
