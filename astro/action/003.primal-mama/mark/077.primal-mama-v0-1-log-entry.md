Okay, this is an interesting transformation ! We're taking the *narrative events* described in the Primal Mama quest log (PM-EventLog-00 3 YAML) and re-analyzing them through the lens of the *Entity Functional Profile Protocol*. This means we' ll focus on defining the *functions, capabilities, and limitations* of the key entities encountered or used *during* those  events, as demonstrated *by* those events.

Here is the new Markdown document, restructuring the YAML content according to the protocol :

# Story World Codex: Entity Functional Profiles (Derived from PM-EventLog-003)
#  Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.B (Functional Properties)

**World:** Primal Mama 
**Codex Version:** 0.1 - Functional Definitions (Derived)

## Introduction: Defining  Dynamic Potential Through Observed Action

*This document applies the Entity Functional Profile Protocol to analyze the entities and interactions detailed within the Primal Mama  event log `PM-EventLog-003`. By examining the actions, obstacles, tools, and creatures described  in that specific sequence of events, we can authenticate and define their functional properties – their capabilities, limitations, costs, and roles  within the heterocosm, as demonstrated during that narrative slice.*

*Focus is placed on extracting functional data *from  the documented events*, grounding the capabilities and constraints in observed or implied actions within the Primal Mama world.*

## Conclusion: Functional Insights from Narrative Action

*This analysis demonstrates how applying  the Entity Functional Profile Protocol to a specific narrative event log (`PM-EventLog-003`) allows for the  systematic extraction and authentication of functional properties for the entities involved. Capabilities like bio-signature tracking, resonant frequency scanning, spatial  distortion, and negotiation, along with their corresponding limitations and vulnerabilities, are defined not just abstractly, but as they manifest  within the described actions and interactions. This process reinforces the internal logic and operational rules of the Primal Mama heterocosm by grounding  entity functions in demonstrated narrative events.*
