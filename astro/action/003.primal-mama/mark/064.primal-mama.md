Okay, this is an  excellent exercise in applying a world-building protocol to existing data to deepen its integration and define its function within the Primal  Mama heterocosm.

We'll treat each "Bayou Brew" as an "Entity" (specifically, a consumable  Object) and define its functional profile. I'll need to *infer* or *create plausible* effects for each  brew based on its name, source organism, and the general Primal Mama vibes, as the original list only provided ingredients .

Here's the recontextualized YAML data presented as a Markdown document using the "Entity Functional Profile Protocol ":

# Story World Codex: Entity Functional Profile Protocol - Bayou Brews
# Based on Doležel's  Heterocosmica III.B.II.B (Functional Properties)

## Introduction: Defining Dynamic Potential of Bayou Brews Through Authentication

*This  section applies the Entity Functional Profile Protocol to define the **functional properties** of various Bayou Brews within the Primal Mama heter ocosm. These consumable items, when imbibed, grant sustained, passive biological or supernatural effects at the cost of significant  Miasmic Strain.*

*Focus is on **authenticating** their functions clearly and consistently. This includes their ** capabilities (the buff granted)**, as well as crucial **limitations (Miasmic Strain, duration, specific conditions )**, and **costs (ingredients required for crafting)**. These properties are essential for narrative mechanics involving resource gathering, character augmentation , and understanding the risks and rewards of harnessing the bayou's potent essences.*

### Functional Profile Summary  & Narrative Role:

*   **Core Functional Identity:** `A potent, long-lasting alchemical tonic derived from Alpha  Solar-Gators, granting light-dependent regeneration and resilience at the cost of high Miasmic Strain.`
*    **Key Narrative Functions Served:** `Player/NPC augmentation, crafting objective, demonstrates advanced (if risky) bio-alchemy, reinforces  the theme of adapting to/harnessing the altered environment.`
*   **Relationship to Alethic Modality:** `Oper ates within the world's established bio-energetic principles (solar power for GE gators, transferrable properties via  alchemy). Its creation and effects are possible according to Primal Mama's internal rules.`
*   **Key Functional T ensions/Trade-offs:** `Sustained powerful buff vs. high Miasmic Strain and light dependency. R arity of Alpha Solar-Gator components vs. desirability of effect.`

### Functional Profile Summary & Narrative Role:

*   **Core  Functional Identity:** `A strange but effective tonic that enhances stealth, speed, and grants a minor life-draining ability,  embodying the perverse nature of Vampire Bunnies. Carries a notable Miasmic Strain.`
*   **Key Narrative  Functions Served:** `Stealth/infiltration aid, demonstrates the weirder side of Primal Mama's ecosystem and alchemy , resource for characters specializing in subtlety.`
*   **Relationship to Alethic Modality:** `Draws on the authenticated  (if bizarre) biological/supernatural properties of Vampire Bunnies, making them transferable.`

**(This structure would be repeated for ALL the  brews listed in the YAML file, with plausible effects, costs, and narrative roles defined for each based on its name and source  within the Primal Mama world.)**

**General Notes on Brews within this Protocol:**

*   **Miasmic  Strain:** This is a universal "Vulnerability" or "Operational Constraint" for all Bayou Brews, scaled according to potency .
*   **Cypress Still Spirit:** A common "Cost" component for crafting, representing the alchemical base. 
*   **Duration:** Generally long-lasting, but variable and potentially extendable via character traits (Miasma Accl imatization).
*   **Effects:** Designed to be passive and less "game-changing" than instant "potions," fitting  the "decoction" concept.
*   **Authentication:** Relies on established Primal Mama lore (creatures, phenomena , alchemical principles) and the idea of discoverable/hoarded recipes.

This conversion takes the raw ingredient list and transforms  it into a set of functionally defined game/story elements, ready for deeper integration into narratives or gameplay systems within the Primal  Mama world.
