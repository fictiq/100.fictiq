Okay, this is a fascinating challenge! We're taking the quest  data (already recontextualized for Primal Mama in YAML) and now viewing each *quest itself* as an  "Entity" whose "Functional Properties" are its objectives, outcomes, and narrative impact, all through the lens of the  "Entity Functional Profile Protocol."

This will be a conceptual shift. Instead of defining a character or creature, we're  defining the *function* of a narrative event (the quest) within the game/story system.

Here's the new  Markdown document:

## Story World Codex: Quest Entity Functional Profile Protocol (Primal Mama)
## Based on Dole žel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.B (Functional Properties)

**World:** Primal Mama 
**Codex Version:** 0.2 - Quest Functional Definitions
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

## Introduction: Defining Quest Dynamics Through Authentication

*This protocol  guides the definition of the **functional properties** of Quest Entities within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel,  these properties define a quest's potential for player action, interaction, world impact, and narrative progression, all within the world's  established rules (modalities). They encompass **capabilities (objectives achievable by the player, information revealed, world states changed )** as well as crucial **limitations (prerequisites, failure conditions, required player skills/resources).** *

*Focus on  **authenticating** these functions clearly. Define not just *what* a quest achieves, but *how* it unfolds , under *what conditions*, at *what cost* (player effort/risk), and what *it requires or enables*. These  properties are essential for narrative mechanics, player agency, and world coherence.*

*(This process would continue for every quest in the YAML file , transforming each into a detailed "Entity Functional Profile." Each quest's objectives become "Capabilities" it enables for the player , its challenges become "Costs" or rely on player "Skills," and its narrative purpose becomes its "Core Functional Identity"  and "Narrative Functions Served." The "Authentication Source" would always be the YAML quest log entry itself, or underlying  world rule documents like the Primal Mama Coherence Protocol.)*

This approach allows for a very systematic and detailed breakdown of how  each piece of narrative content (a quest) functions within the larger system of the Primal Mama world, ensuring its actions,  requirements, and outcomes are consistent with the established modalities.
