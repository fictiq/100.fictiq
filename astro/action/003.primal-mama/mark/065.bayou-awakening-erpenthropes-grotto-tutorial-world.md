Okay, this is a great exercise in shifting perspective! We'll take the Primal Mama quest data  (as represented by the YAML) and re-frame it through the lens of the "Entity Functional Profile Protocol."

Instead  of a narrative quest flow, we'll now have a series of functional profiles for the key entities mentioned or implied * by* that quest segment.

## Introduction: Defining Dynamic Potential Through Authentication (Bayou Awakening)

*This document applies the Entity  Functional Profile Protocol to entities featured or implied within the "Bayou Awakening" quest segment. It defines their functional properties— capabilities and limitations—as demonstrated or strongly suggested by their roles and interactions in that introductory scenario. Authentication is primarily drawn from the ` PrimalMama_Quest_BayouAwakening.yaml` (representing the quest's events) and the overarching  `PrimalMama_CoherenceProtocol.md`.*

### Functional Profile Summary & Narrative Role:

*   **Core Functional Identity:** `Remy functions as a seasoned  swamp survivor possessing unique Erpenthropic sensory capabilities, enabling interaction with the world's subtle energies. He is functionally  capable of basic self-preservation and interaction with local technology (70s aesthetic security). His limitations stem from respons ibilities towards others and the inherent unpredictability of his environment.`
*   **Key Narrative Functions Served:** `Drives initial  tutorial objectives; Introduces core world mechanics (Erpenthrope Senses, tech aesthetic); Establishes relationships with key  supporting characters.`
*   **Relationship to Alethic Modality:** `His Erpenthrope Senses directly  instantiate the world's authenticated rules regarding spectral interaction and heightened perception for certain individuals. His use of solar-heated water  and retro-tech aligns with Solar Dominance and Tech Aesthetic Constraint modalities.`
*   **Key Functional Tensions/Trade- offs:** `Need for peace/solitude vs. responsibility for P'tit Gator; Advanced senses vs. mundane vulnerabilities  (bunny nips); Reliance on personal skill vs. dependence on specific tools (fob, Navigator).`

*(This process would be repeated for P'tit Gator, Old Man Bayou,  the Vampire Bunny, the Reinforced Door, the Bayou Navigator, and even The Gutbucket Grotto itself if we consider its functional aspects  like the solar water heater or defensible structure, drawing all functional evidence from the YAML quest description.)*
