## I. Core Function / Purpose:

*    **- Primary Role:** `[Resolve the spectral contamination (haunting) of the Abandoned Settlement well, thereby restoring  its function as a source of pure water required to fulfill the dependency of saving Jedediah's kin; Facilitate player exploration and  interaction with the Lickskillet Southern Fringe environment.]` # Auth: Quest Premise (YAML: objective, problem _summary)
*   **- Secondary Role(s):** `[Introduce and characterize local NPCs (Jedediah , Mama Léonie); Provide functional challenges requiring player capabilities (combat, exploration, investigation, interaction); Deliver world-building via  environmental storytelling and discovered texts (Calamity effects, Oligarchy history hints, spectral lore); Offer resource acquisition opportunities (loot , currency, salvage, formulas); Present minor moral/value choice (reward acceptance).]` # Auth: Quest Content Analysis  (YAML: steps, rewards)

## II. Key Capabilities & Interacting Entities (Functional Roles within Quest):

* Purpose: Define the functional roles and relevant properties of entities interacting within this specific quest module.*

*   **- Entity: Player Character  (Implicit)**
    *   *Function:* `[Primary agent executing the quest protocols. Success requires leveraging authenticated capabilities for  navigation (watercraft proficiency), combat (vs. Scavengers, Miasma Wraith), investigation (utilizing specialized senses analogue ), interaction (NPC dialogue protocols, environmental object manipulation), and resource management.]`
    *   *Constraint:* `[ Effective function depends on player skill and access/utilization of world-appropriate tools and knowledge (e.g., Gator -Tooth Blade, containment ritual knowledge, Erpenthrope senses if applicable, adequate gear).]`
*   **- Entity : Jedediah (NPC)**
    *   *Function:* `[Quest Giver Node. Authenticates the initial  problem state, provides objective parameters, acts as the primary interaction point for contract negotiation and final reward disbursement.]`
     *   *Capability:* `[Initiates Haggling Sub-Protocol: Base offer 40 Scrip, annoyance  threshold ~60 Scrip, target ~50 Scrip.]` # Auth: YAML: contract
    *   * Limitation:* `[Possesses insufficient capabilities/resources to resolve the spectral contamination directly.]`
*   **- Entity:  Jedediah's Kin (NPC)**
    *   *Function:* `[Narrative Catalyst Entity. Emb odies the primary stake (life/death), establishing the urgency and dependency driving the quest objective (need for pure water).]`
     *   *Inability:* `[Incapacitated by authenticated illness; cannot perform actions.]`
*   **- Entity : Mama Léonie (NPC - Mentioned)**
    *   *Function:* `[Epistemic Authority Node . Provides critical authenticated knowledge: links illness to contaminated water and identifies the well water as the necessary (currently unobtainable) solution,  thus validating the quest's core premise.]` # Auth: YAML: initiation
*   **- Entity: Miasma  Wraith (Antagonist Creature)**
    *   *Function:* `[Primary Obstacle Entity. Enforces the blocked  state of the Well objective through active hostility and environmental influence. Embodies the spectral threat profile.]`
    *   *Capabilities  (Authenticated Strengths):* `[Spectral melee attacks ('Swift spectral claw swipes'), Area Denial ('Disorienting miasma  cloud'), Evasion/Misdirection ('Periodic fading / illusory duplicates').]` # Auth: YAML: combat
    *   * Vulnerability (Authenticated Point of Failure):* `[Physicality/Susceptibility increased when within the area of effect of an  active Containment Sigil; Fundamentally bound to the Tarnished Silver Locket.]` # Auth: YAML: combat , investigation_follow_trail
    *   *Inability (Authenticated Weakness):* `[Cannot be permanently  neutralized without addressing its binding object (Tarnished Silver Locket).]`
*   **- Entity: Tarnished Silver Locket  (Object)**
    *   *Function:* `[Key Object / Binding Anchor. Acts as the physical link for  the Miasma Wraith's manifestation. Retrieval is a mandatory step for quest resolution protocol. Functions as investigative clue and  resolution component.]` # Auth: YAML: action_explore, combat
*   **- Entity: Water-Damaged Journal ( Object)**
    *   *Function:* `[Information Object / Epistemic Resource. Provides contextual clues ('Epistemic data ') regarding the Wraith's origin story and the potential nature/existence of a binding object, facilitating the investigation function.]` #  Auth: YAML: examine_item
*   **- Entity: Abandoned Settlement Well (Location/Object)**
     *   *Function:* `[Primary Objective Location. Designed function (providing pure water) is currently blocked/inactive due to spectral  contamination (Miasma Wraith presence). Contains the Key Object (Tarnished Silver Locket).]`
    *   * Operational Constraint:* `[Water retrieval function disabled until Wraith entity is neutralized.]`
*   **- Entity: Sc avengers (Minor Antagonists)**
    *   *Function:* `[Secondary Obstacle Entity / Environmental Hazard. Provide  localized combat challenge and function as a loot distribution node.]` # Auth: YAML: encounter_loot
*   **-  Entity: Whispering Cypress (Place of Power)**
    *   *Function:* `[Optional Resource Node / Environmental  Boon. Offers temporary capability enhancement (mundane buff) or potential permanent character development resource (Erpenthrope Ability Point).]` #  Auth: YAML: discovery_powerup

## IV. Authenticated Outcomes & Narrative Role Summary:

*   **- Successful  Completion State:** `[Miasma Wraith entity function neutralized; Tarnished Silver Locket function transformed (becomes inert Wraith Fetish);  Well object restored to primary function (safe water source); Dependency fulfilled (Jedediah's kin saved - implied positive  state change); Player receives authenticated rewards (XP, Scrip/Salvage); Southern Fringe sub-region state altered (threat  removed, area explored).]`
*   **- Core Functional Identity:** `[This quest module functions as a self -contained, localized problem-solving loop within the Primal Mama system. It integrates core gameplay functions (exploration, investigation , combat, interaction) with narrative delivery mechanisms (environmental storytelling, NPC dialogue, item descriptions) to create a cohesive player  experience.]`
*   **- Key Narrative Functions Served:** `[Instantiates spectral threat type and associated mechanics ( binding objects, ritualistic solutions); Reinforces core world themes (survival, post-Calamity hazards, community resilience /struggle); Provides diegetic justification for exploration and resource acquisition; Offers minor player agency through dialogue and reward choices;  Seeds potential future plotlines (Oligarchy history, 'Clara').]`
*   **- Relationship to Mod alities:** `[Engages player with world rules: Alethic (spectral properties, ritual effectiveness, limits of technology ), Deontic (contract obligations, haggling etiquette, reward choice implications), Axiological (value of life vs. Sc rip, community aid), and Epistemic (gathering clues, interpreting the journal, understanding spectral lore).]`
