Okay, let's recontextualize the  Primal Mama Bayou Bombs YAML data using the structure of the Entity Functional Profile Protocol. Each bomb type (Base, Improved,  Prime) will be treated as a distinct entity defined by its functional properties.

## Introduction: Defining Bayou Bomb Dynamics

*This document applies the Entity Functional Profile Protocol to the various **Bayou Bombs ** available in the Primal Mama heterocosm. Each bomb is treated as an 'Object' entity whose dynamic potential is defined by  its authenticated capabilities (effects, damage), limitations (consumability, blast radius), costs (crafting components, replenishment via Swamp Hooch ), and operational constraints (throwing mechanics, environmental interactions).*

*Focusing on these functional properties ensures each bomb has a clear, consistent  role within the game's systems and narrative, grounded in the world's established rules (modalities) and resources .*

### Functional Profile Summary & Narrative Role:

*   **Core Functional Identity:** ` A basic, craftable incendiary object delivering immediate area fire damage and a brief burning status effect. Represents accessible, low -tier explosive utility.`
*   **Key Narrative Functions Served:** `Provides early-game offensive capability (fire damage),  environmental interaction (ignition), resource management challenge (crafting/Hooch).`
*   **Relationship to Aleth ic Modality:** `Operates via plausible chemical combustion based on authenticated local flora/fauna components within the world's rules.` 
*   **Key Functional Tensions/Trade-offs:** `Utility (Fire Damage) vs. Cost/Cons umability (Components, Hooch, Inventory Slot). Effectiveness vs. Limited Duration/Radius.`

### Functional Profile  Summary & Narrative Role:

*   **Core Functional Identity:** `An upgraded craftable incendiary object offering longer- lasting burning effects compared to the base version, requiring rarer components and the base bomb itself.`
