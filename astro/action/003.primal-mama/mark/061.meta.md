Okay , this is an excellent way to dive deep into how the quests would *functionally operate* within Primal Mama,  using the Entity Functional Profile Protocol.

We'll treat each quest objective as a scenario where different entities (Player, Creatures, Items , Locations with specific functions) interact based on their authenticated properties. The YAML's `log_entry` will be our  primary authentication source for the functions demonstrated or required in each quest.

Here's the recontextualized YAML data  as a Markdown document, structured according to the Entity Functional Profile Protocol:
