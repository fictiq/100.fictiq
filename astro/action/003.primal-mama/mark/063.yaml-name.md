Okay, this is an excellent way to deeply integrate your  world-building! We'll take each "Swamp Concoction" from the YAML and give it a full " Entity Functional Profile" based on the protocol you provided. This will be a much more detailed document.

I'll use the  top-level `name` from the YAML as the title for this new Markdown document.

# Primal Mama:  Swamp Concoctions & Jury-Rigged Explosives (Functional Profiles)
# Based on Doležel's Heter ocosmica III.B.II.B (Functional Properties)

**World:** Primal Mama
**Codex Version:**  0.2 - Consumable Functional Definitions
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]
**Lead Architect(s): ** [Your Name/Studio Name]

## Introduction: Defining Dynamic Potential Through Authentication

*This protocol guides  the definition of the **functional properties** of entities within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel, these properties define an  entity's potential for action, interaction, and influence within the world's established rules (modalities). They encompass ** capabilities (abilities, skills, powers)** as well as crucial **limitations (weaknesses, costs, constraints, in abilities)**.*

*Focus on **authenticating** these functions clearly and consistently. Define not just *what* an entity can  do, but *how*, under *what conditions*, at *what cost*, and crucially, *what it cannot do *. These properties are essential for narrative mechanics, conflict generation, character agency, and world coherence, especially for jury-rigged consumables  vital for survival in the bayou.*
