Okay , I will take the Markdown document "Primal Mama: Quest Event Entity Functional Analysis" and re-contextualize  it into a new YAML document, adhering to the Entity Functional Profile Protocol structure.

This YAML will represent the functional analysis of entities  as they appear within the specific quest contexts.
