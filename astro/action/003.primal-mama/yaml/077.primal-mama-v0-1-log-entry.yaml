Okay, this is an interesting meta-step. We're taking the Markdown  document *that was already structured according to the Entity Functional Profile Protocol* (and which analyzed the Primal Mama quest log),  and now we're converting *that Markdown document* into a YAML representation.

The YAML will mirror the structure of  the Entity Functional Profiles from the Markdown.
