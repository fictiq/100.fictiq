Okay, I will take the Markdown document containing the Entity Functional Profiles for Remy, Mama Mambo , and the Security Fob (derived from the "Bayou Awakening" quest context) and recontextualize it into  a YAML document.

This YAML document will represent the same information, structured according to the Entity Functional Profile Protocol, making  it data-centric and ready for loading. Values containing colons will be wrapped in quotes.

introduction: |
  This document applies the Entity Functional Profile Protocol to entities featured or implied within the "Bay ou Awakening" quest segment. It defines their functional properties—capabilities and limitations—as demonstrated or strongly suggested by their roles and interactions in  that introductory scenario. Authentication is primarily drawn from the `PrimalMama_Quest_BayouAwakening.yaml` (representing  the quest's events) and the overarching `PrimalMama_CoherenceProtocol.md`.
