Okay , I will now convert the Markdown document (which details the Bayou Brews using the Entity Functional Profile Protocol) into a  YAML document. This YAML will systematically represent the functional profiles of each brew.

protocolIntroduction: |
  This section applies the Entity Functional Profile Protocol to  define the functional properties of various Bayou Brews within the Primal Mama heterocosm. These consumable items, when imbibed,  grant sustained, passive biological or supernatural effects at the cost of significant Miasmic Strain.
  Focus is on authentic ating their functions clearly and consistently. This includes their capabilities (the buff granted), as well as crucial limitations (Miasmic Strain,  duration, specific conditions), and costs (ingredients required for crafting). These properties are essential for narrative mechanics involving resource gathering, character  augmentation, and understanding the risks and rewards of harnessing the bayou's potent essences.

generalNotesOnBrews:
  miasmicStrain: "This  is a universal 'Vulnerability' or 'Operational Constraint' for all Bayou Brews, scaled according to potency."
  cypress StillSpirit: "A common 'Cost' component for crafting, representing the alchemical base."

   effects: "Designed to be passive and less 'game-changing' than instant 'potions,' fitting the 'decoction' concept ."
  authentication: "Relies on established Primal Mama lore (creatures, phenomena, alchemical principles) and  the idea of discoverable/hoarded recipes."
