   functional_summary:
    core_functional_identity: "`QUEST_BayouRiftsOligarchTruths ` functions as a **guided, multi-stage traversal system** utilizing `Veil Tear` mechanics to propel the player through a  curated sequence of diverse and hazardous Primal Mama environments. Its core capability is **structured environmental challenge presentation** (hazards, enemies)  interwoven with **lore delivery** and culminating in a **narrative resolution** facilitated by a key NPC (`NPC_Jaco`) and  unique ability (`ABILITY_GhostCommunion_01`)."
    key_narrative_functions_served:  'Drives the main plot forward regarding the "Invisible Women" conspiracy/Calamity origins; showcases the breadth and dangers of the  Primal Mama world beyond typical Bayou settings; demonstrates Erpenthrope capabilities and Oligarch power dynamics; provides significant environmental puzzle-solving  and combat challenges; reinforces world lore through exploration and discovery.' # Quotes needed due to internal quotes
    relationship_to_ alethic_modality: "The quest explicitly validates several world rules: the *possibility* of interdimensional travel  via Veil Tears, the *necessity* of adhering to environmental hazard rules (spores, cold), the *possibility * of spectral interaction via specific rituals (Ghost Communion), and the *necessity* of overcoming tangible obstacles (enemies, blocked paths )." # Quotes needed due to colons
    key_functional_tensions_tradeoffs: "Player progression vs. Environmental  Lethality; Need for Jaco's guidance vs. Moments of Player Isolation; Resource expenditure vs. Reward acquisition;  Linear structure vs. Player desire for exploration (within stages)." # Quotes needed due to semicolons
