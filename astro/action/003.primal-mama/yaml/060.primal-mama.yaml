Okay, this is a complex but logical transformation. The previous Markdown output ("Primal Mama:  Quest Log Functional Deconstruction") will serve as the source material. I will now re-cast that deconstruction into a YAML  file where each top-level item is an **Entity Functional Profile**, structured according to the `action` markdown file' s protocol.

This new YAML document will be a catalog of entities encountered in the "Bayou Bloat and Mudbank  Mysteries" questline, detailing their functional roles and properties as observed or inferred from that narrative segment.
