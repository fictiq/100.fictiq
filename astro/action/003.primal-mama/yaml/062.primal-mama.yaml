introduction: |
  This document deconstructs the "Bayou Blues"  quest narrative (as defined in its YAML structure) to extract and define the **functional properties** of the entities involved.  By applying the Entity Functional Profile Protocol, we identify the capabilities, limitations, purposes, and interactions of characters, objects,  creatures, and even locations as they operate within the quest's unfolding events. This analysis helps solidify the internal logic of  the quest and its alignment with the broader Primal Mama heterocosm.
