functional_profile_summary :
  core_functional_identity: |
    QUEST_BayouBreakout functions as a multi-stage  narrative delivery mechanism, guiding the player through investigation, chase, infiltration, combat, and puzzle-solving loops. It leverages  core Primal Mama mechanics and lore (Erpenthropes, Oligarchy, Cattle Taboo, 70s Tech , specific creatures) to create a cohesive gameplay experience focused on uncovering inconvenient truths and challenging established power structures.
  key_narr ative_functions_served: |
    Drives the central plot against the Coastal Meat Barons; Establishes Silas as  a key ally/quest giver; Introduces the threat/nature of Oligarchy operations; Provides concrete evidence of illegal Cattle  Artifact experimentation; Creates narrative choices with immediate (diversion) and long-term (follow-up quest) consequences;  Reinforces world themes of decay, corruption, hidden truths, and retro-futuristic dissonance.
  relationship_to_al ethic_modality: |
    The quest operates firmly within Primal Mama's established rules: necessitates dealing  with authenticated creatures (Vampire Bunnies, Fungal Zombies), utilizes world-specific technology (Scrambler,  Solar Skiff, 70s aesthetic Automatons), hinges on the absolute prohibition of Cattle consumption/experimentation, and involves entities  with defined supernatural capabilities (Silas the Erpenthrope).
  key_functional_tensions_tradeoffs: |
     Stealth vs. Direct Combat approaches in infiltration sections; Optional objective (Diversion) risk/reward vs. direct progression; Resource  expenditure (ammo/health) vs. efficient completion; Following linear path vs. minor exploration for loot/lore.
