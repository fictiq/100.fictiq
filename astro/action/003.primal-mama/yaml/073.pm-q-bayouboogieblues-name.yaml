functional_profile_summary:
  core_functional_identity: "PM_Q_Bay ouBoogieBlues operates as a multi-stage 'fetch-and-resolve' narrative structure. It functions by imposing sequential objectives  on the player, requiring navigation, dialogue, investigation, combat/diplomacy, choice-making, and potentially skill- based minigame capabilities. Its progression is dependent on successful interaction with specific NPC entities and overcoming defined obstacles."
  key _narrative_functions_served: "Drives local plot progression in Lickskillet; Develops the character of Beau  Gator and his relationship with the player/Magnolia May; Introduces thematic elements (local culture, Oligarchy conflict,  Deity reverence, aesthetic choices); Provides gameplay variety (dialogue, combat, investigation, optional race); Acts as a necessary functional  bridge to the subsequent, likely more dramatic, quest involving Magnolia May."
  relationship_to_modalities:
    de ontic: "Obligation: The quest structure imposes obligations on the player via Beau Gator's requests." # Quoted due to  colon
    alethic: "Possibility: Player success relies on exercising possible world actions (combat, dialogue, using  senses, piloting); race outcome depends on possibility defined by skill/mechanics." # Quoted due to colon
    ax iological: "Value: Decor choices allow player expression of value within the 70s aesthetic; helping Beau reflects a choice to value  his goals." # Quoted due to colon
    epistemic: "Knowledge: Player acquires knowledge (Pete's location  from Goons, Beau's schemes)." # Quoted due to colon
  key_functional_tensions_ tradeoffs: "Player resource expenditure (Scrip for Pete) vs. alternative solutions (Race skill); Time/effort of optional  objective (Race) vs. reward gained; Diplomatic approach vs. Combat approach (Cletus); Player decor preference vs.  Beau's potential reaction."
