  introduction: |
    This document analyzes the "Lickskillet Hust le" scenario sequence through the lens of Entity Functional Profiles. It examines how the Runner's authenticated functional properties are applied  to interact with, overcome, or utilize the functional properties of other entities and environmental constraints within the Primal Mama heteroc osm. Each quest step is viewed as an instance of functional interaction, governed by the world's established modalities.

  summary:
    title : "III. Functional Profile Summary of Scenario"
    text: |
      The "Lickskillet Hust le" scenario effectively tests and utilizes a broad range of the Runner's core functional properties. Key capabilities demonstrated include:  Mobility (Swimming, Climbing, Skiff Operation), Combat (Melee, Ranged, vs various types), Investigation (Per ception, Tracking, Analysis), Social Interaction (Dialogue, Negotiation), Technical Interaction (Scanning, Interfacing), and Decision Making .
      The scenario highlights Constraints (hazards, locks, skill checks) and Dependencies (gear). The interplay between  Runner functions and entity/environment functions/constraints drives progression and challenge. Successfully navigating this scenario requires a versatile functional profile.
