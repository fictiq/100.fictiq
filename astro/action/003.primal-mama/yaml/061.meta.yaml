    # ... (This structure would continue for ALL remaining quests and their involved  entities)
    # For brevity, I will stop here, but the pattern should be clear for:
    # -  Lair of the Bloated One
    # - Reclaimed Outpost
    # - Relic of Solar Faith 
    # - Schematic: 'Swamp Walker' Reinforced Waders
    # - Murky Waters, Dark Secret
    #  - Master Schematic: 'Sun Blade' Electro-Machete
    # Each would detail the functional profiles of F eral GE 'Gatorzilla', Bloated Mirefiend,
    # Swamp Rats, Junk Peddler (potential  functions), Solar Shrine (interaction function),
    # Feral Erpenthropes, Sky-Terror Cockatrice,  Tattered Journal Page (information function),
    # 'Night Howler' Pack, etc., all based on their  descriptions in the quest log entries.
