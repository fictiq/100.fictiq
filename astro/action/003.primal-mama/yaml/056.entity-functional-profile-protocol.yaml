Okay, this is the next level of re- contextualization! We'll take the *Markdown document of Entity Functional Profiles for Primal Mama* (which you just generated)  and convert *that specific content* into a YAML file.

The structure of the YAML will be guided by the " Entity Functional Profile Protocol" (your `action.md` file), meaning each entity's profile in YAML will mirror  the sections outlined in that protocol.

Here's the YAML output:

```yaml
world: "Primal Mama" 
codex_version: "0.2 - Functional Profiles from Initial Quest"
last_updated: "[Current Date]"
 lead_architects: "[Your Name/Studio Name]"

document_introduction: |
  This document applies the " Entity Functional Profile Protocol" to key entities encountered during the initial narrative sequence "Bayou Beginnings & Lickskillet Blues" ( as re-contextualized for Primal Mama). The events, dialogues, and descriptions within that quest serve as the ** primary authentication sources** for the functional properties of these entities.

  By analyzing what entities *do*, *can do*, and  *cannot do* within the established quest narrative, we define their dynamic potential. This ensures that future portrayals of these  entities (and similar entities) remain consistent with their initial introduction, reinforcing the world's internal logic and coherence.

document_conclusion: |
  This analysis demonstrates how the "Entity Functional Profile Protocol" can be applied  to narrative content. By treating the events of "Bayou Beginnings & Lickskillet Blues" as authenticated occurrences , we can extract and define the functional properties of the entities involved. This method ensures that as the world of Primal Mama expands , the behaviors and abilities of its inhabitants and objects remain consistent with their established introductions, strengthening the heterocosm's  internal logic and believability.

  Future development can now reference these authenticated profiles to ensure consistency when these entities (or similar ones ) reappear or when their functions are expanded upon.

**Key YAML Features and Conventions Used:**

1.  **Top -Level Keys:** I've included the metadata from the Markdown header (`world`, `codex_version`, etc.)  and the `document_introduction` and `document_conclusion` as top-level keys.
2.  **` entities` List:** The core data is a list under the `entities` key. Each item in this list is a  dictionary representing a single entity's profile.
3.  **Mapping Sections to Keys:**
    *   The  main sections of the Markdown profile (Entity ID, Name, Type, Auth Sources, Functional Properties Bundle, Summary) are direct  keys.
    *   Sub-sections within "Authenticated Functional Properties Bundle" (Core Function, Key Capabilities, Ac quired Skills, etc.) are nested dictionaries or lists of dictionaries.
4.  **Lists for Multiple Items:** Capabilities , skills, inabilities, vulnerabilities, constraints are all lists (`- item`) of dictionaries, as an entity can have multiple of  these.
5.  **Multi-line Strings:** `|` is used for `description`, `authentication`, `limits_ nuances`, `narrative_function`, and the summary fields to preserve readability and newlines.
6.  **Authentication  Notes:** The `# Auth: [Source]` comments from your Markdown are embedded directly into the relevant string values (e.g.,  in `primary_role`, `description`, `authentication` fields). This keeps the authentication context close to the item it authentic ates.
7.  **Quoting Values with Colons:** This was a specific request. All string *values* that contain  a colon (`:`) have been enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `'Apprentice/ward to Mama Gris-Gris  & Old Man Croaker, potential community helper. # Auth: Dialogue & interactions in Tutorial.'`). This is crucial for correct  YAML parsing.
    *   Keys themselves generally don't need quoting unless they contain special characters, which wasn't the case  here.
8.  **Handling Empty Sections:** If a section like "Vulnerabilities & Weaknesses" was  empty in the Markdown, I've either commented it out (`# No specific vulnerabilities...`) or simply omitted the key  if it was a list that would be empty, to keep the YAML cleaner. You can choose to explicitly include empty lists (` vulnerabilities_weaknesses: []`) if your parser prefers that. I've shown an example with the commented -out section.
9.  **Implied Information:** For the GE Alligator's `INAB-GEG ATOR-TECHVULN-01` and `DEPEND-GEGATOR-SOLAR-01`,  I added `(Implied)` or `(Implied by general GE Alligator lore)` to the name/description to reflect that  this wasn't *directly* demonstrated by *that specific gator* in the quest but is based on established world rules .

This YAML structure should be robust and easy to parse, accurately reflecting the detailed functional profiles from your Markdown document.
