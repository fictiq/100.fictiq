Okay, this is an interesting transformation! We are taking the *Markdown output* from the previous step (where  quests were profiled as entities) and converting *that specific structure* into a YAML document. Each quest's functional profile,  as detailed in that Markdown, will become a structured YAML object.

Here's the YAML representation of the Markdown file  you provided:

```yaml
# Story World Codex: Quest Entity Functional Profile Protocol (Primal Mama) - YAML Export 
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.B (Functional Properties)

world: Primal  Mama
codex_version: '0.2 - Quest Functional Definitions (YAML Export)'
last_updated: '[ Current Date]' # Placeholder

introduction_ functional_definitions: |
  This protocol guides the definition of the functional properties of Quest Entities within the Primal Mama heter ocosm.
  Following Doležel, these properties define a quest's potential for player action, interaction, world impact,
   and narrative progression, all within the world's established rules (modalities). They encompass capabilities
  (objectives  achievable by the player, information revealed, world states changed) as well as crucial limitations
  (prerequisites, failure  conditions, required player skills/resources).
  Focus on authenticating these functions clearly. Define not just what a quest achieves, but  how it unfolds,
  under what conditions, at what cost (player effort/risk), and what it requires or enables. These  properties
  are essential for narrative mechanics, player agency, and world coherence.
