## Introduction: Constituting Glopratchet's Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (primarily Globs, but also significant Harvesters or other sentient  constructs) within the Glopratchet heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, these entities **ARE**  constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives, Gl opratchet Internal Coherence Protocol v0.6). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition.** This  is especially crucial for understanding Globs, whose entire existence is a testament to their transient forms and their profound, often desperate,  spiritual responses to the grinding flow.*

*Use this template to systematically build Glopratchet entities by explicitly authenticating their properties  across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated  bundle**, particularly regarding their relationship to their own bodies, CMP, the Ratchetwork, and their chosen spiritual path (Adam ant Rite, Liquescent Way, or other). Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally  left undefined, especially concerning the unfathomable 'inner lives' beyond authenticated belief systems and reactions.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties  constituting this entity's being within the Glopratchet heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form &  Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence and state within Glopratchet' s material reality.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [e.g., Glob: Large, densely compacted , appears mostly opaque with dull grey-brown hue. Adamant Rite. Shows signs of voluntary CMP restriction. Current form : Sub-spherical, slight faceting from self-compression.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *    `- Appearance_Specific Features: [e.g., Glob: Embedded with fine, ochre-colored mineral dust (" Earth's Kiss") around densest points. Surface shows fine craze-lines indicative of HARDening processes. Subtle internal shimmer from particular  mineral inclusions.]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [e.g.,  Glob: A significant, partially healed "Shatter Scar" across one flank from a past Ratchetwork upheaval.  One pseudopod deliberately shaped to mimic a "True Shard."]` # Auth: [Source]
    *   `-  Typical "Attire"/Adornment: [e.g., Glob: Ritualistic scoring patterns indicating adherence to specific  Adamant Rite tenets. Deliberately maintains a coating of specific Ratchetwork dust considered sacred.]` # Auth: [Source  - Visual Guide / Narrative Desc.]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern (if applicable): [e.g.,  Glob: Low, resonant hums and clicks, speech formed by vibrating core mass. Cadence is slow, deliberate, reflecting Adam ant Rite solemnity. Harvester: Synthesized, monotonous, protocol-driven announcements.]` # Auth: [Source -  Dialogue Direction / Audio Ref]`
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [e.g., Glob ( Adamant): Slow, deliberate rolling or braced movement, seeks contact with solid Ratchetwork ("Grounding Rites"). Exhibits  slight, controlled momentum due to density. (Liquescent): Flowing, undulating, readily influenced by currents.]` # Auth : [Action Description]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [e.g., Glob: Faint smell  of desiccating CMP, specific mineral dust (like crushed stone), faint ozone if near active Ratchetwork.]` # Auth:  [Source - Sensory Palette]
    *   `- Current CMP Level & Stability: [e.g., Moderately low  but stable due to controlled intake (Adamant). High and fluctuating (Liquescent). Critically low (Desicc ating).]` # Auth: [Narrative State]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [e.g.,  Exact internal mass distribution, full spectrum of light absorption/reflection unless narratively significant, minute-to-minute CMP fluctuations.]`

 **2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot * do, especially in relation to Glopratchet mechanics and spiritual practices.*
    *   `- Skill: [e. g., Glob (Adamant): Advanced Ritual Self-Compression (increases density, resists minor kinetic forces). Skilled in identifying " Earth's Kiss" mineral veins.]` # Auth: [Demonstrated Actions]
    *   `- Skill: [e. g., Glob (Liquescent): Proficient in Communal Merging (temporary shared consciousness/mass). Can navigate complex  fluid flows.]` # Auth: [Demonstrated Actions Ch. X]
    *   `- Skill: [e.g ., Harvester: Efficient material sorting and processing (Prime Ratcheting Imperative). Can operate designated Ratchetwork machinery .]` # Auth: [World Rules]
    *   `- Ability (Unique/Path-Specific): [e.g.,  Glob (Adamant): "Bodily Memory" - slight, authenticated enhancement to structural integrity when performing "Grounding Rites " at known sacred sites, primarily psychological but with minor, observable resistance to disruption.]` # Auth: [Narrative  Descriptions / Coherence Protocol Rule I.1]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical/Existential): [e .g., Glob: Absolute dependence on CMP. Vulnerable to Shattering (if HARDened) or Dissolution (if SOFT ened) based on specific stressors. Limited direct manipulation of complex external objects.]` # Auth: [World Rules]
     *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [e.g., Glob: Fragmented understanding of Ratchetwork's grand  design. "Earth Superstition" lore is experiential and passed down, not comprehensive or scientifically "accurate".]` # Auth:  [Coherence Protocol Rule I.Epistemic]
    *   `- Limitation (Ritual): [e.g., Glob  (Adamant): "Earth's Kiss" absorption has subtle, primarily psychological/faith-based impact on resilience, not miraculous  physical change. "Grounding Rites" offer no true protection against major Ratchetwork events.]` # Auth: [Coherence  Protocol Rule I.1]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [e.g., Precise speed  of movement unless specified; ability to perceive specific EM spectra beyond basic light/heat; exact threshold of CMP deprivation before irreversible  desiccation begins.]`

     *   `- Key Belief (Adamant Rite): [e.g., "**The body is sacred; its current physical manifestation is  the primary locus of being and meaning.** Resilience, density, integrity of form, and a dignified, solid end are paramount . **'Being in the body'** is a state of mindful presence and physical self-actualization. Dissolution is an  abhorrent erasure."]` # Auth: [Coherence Protocol Rule I.Axiological / Dialogue]
    *    `- Key Belief (Liquescent Way): [e.g., "Transcendence of **the body** is  the true path. Adaptability, flow, release from physical confines lead to ultimate understanding. The physical form is a temporary vessel."]`  # Auth: [Coherence Protocol Rule I.Axiological / Dialogue]
    *   `- Internal Conflict:  [e.g., Glob (Adamant): Fear of painful Shattering vs. desire for "True Shards";  Adherence to **bodily integrity** vs. unavoidable Ratchetwork transformations that warp form; "Earth Superstition"  faith vs. observable indifference of the Ratchetwork.]` # Auth: [Internal Monologue, Difficult Choices Depicted]

        *   *Description:* `[Authenticated minor  increase in resistance to environmental desiccation when actively engaged in "Grounding Rites" at a recognized sacred "Earth"  site. Effect is primarily a manifestation of profound psychological focus on **"being in the body,"** but results in objectively  measurable, albeit slight, delay in CMP loss under specific, authenticated conditions.]`
        *   *Limits:* `[ Requires active ritual focus; site must be genuinely "Earth-touched" by Glob belief; offers no protection against kinetic  damage or extreme CMP deprivation; effect is subtle, not miraculous.]`
        *   *Authentication:* `[Narr ative descriptions of sustained integrity compared to non-ritual-focused Globs in similar mild stressors; Coherence Protocol I.1 Resolution .]`
    *   `# Note: Most Globs operate under general Glopratchet rules. Modal properties signify  a specific, authenticated deviation, often subtle and tied to their deepest convictions or unique make-up.`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function (Glopratchet Context):

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts rooted in Glopratchet' s realities (especially the chosen Path regarding **the body**), and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   ** Core Essence:** `[Summarize the character based on the interplay of their key authenticated properties, emphasizing their relationship with Glopratchet 's core mechanics and philosophies. e.g., Gritstone is constituted as an embodiment of the Adamant Rite's  "Bodily Imperative." His Physical density and adornment with "Earth's Kiss," Functional ritual skills, Psychological  reverence for **his body**, and Social role as an "Earth Keeper" are all interwoven. His existence is a defiant  affirmation of physical form against the Ratchetwork's grinding indifference. His Axiological worth is defined by his Path,  while the Ratchetwork deems him mere material. His Historical connection to "The Motherlode" grounds his "Earth Superstition ."]`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `[e.g., Protagonist exemplifying the Adamant Rite' s struggle for **bodily meaning**; Antagonist representing the Liquescent Way's rejection of form; Catalyst for exploring  themes of faith, futility, and embodiment in a hostile mechanical world; Point-of-view character for specific ritual  experiences.]`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle, Glopratchet Specific):** `[e.g.,  Adamant Glob: Maintaining faith in **the body's importance** when faced with unavoidable physical degradation by the Ratchetwork ; The drive for a "True Shatter" vs. the terror of violent unmaking; Loyalty to "Earth Superstition " vs. the practical need to adapt to changing Ratchetwork geography. Liquescent Glob: Desire for peaceful Dissolution vs.  the violent reality of Catalyst Vents; The allure of communal merging vs. loss of individual awareness.]`
*   **Potential for  Development (Based on Bundle & Glopratchet Dynamics):** `[Where can authenticated properties plausibly change within Gl opratchet's rules? e.g., Deepening or questioning of faith in **the body** due to Rat chetwork events (Psychological/Historical change); Discovery of new "Earth's Kiss" types or sacred sites (Functional /Historical change); Shifting alliances between Path followers (Social/Relational change); Gradual hardening or softening (Physical change ) towards their chosen fate.]`
