## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the  detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the **Glopratchet** heterocosm . Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by  the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives, Glopratchet Coherence Protocol). They possess **no independent  psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across  relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated  bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules – especially the Globs' profound  responses to their existence through paths like the Adamant Rite. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the  specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the Glopratchet heterocosm.)*

**1.  Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence, reflecting their Adam ant Rite practices.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Authenticated as a Glob of notably high density, maintaining  a relatively stable, ovoid form even at rest. Surface texture is less fluid than average Globs, appearing somewhat matte and packed .]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - Adamant Rite principles]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific  Features: [Authenticated to exhibit a dull, earthen coloration, with flecks of various mineral dusts ("Earth's Kiss ") visibly embedded within its outer layers from years of ritual practice. Subtle, hardened ridges mark its form from prolonged self-compression rites .]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - Earth Superstition, Ritual Self-Compression]
     *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [Authenticated to bear several "True Shard" fragments of a revered , Shattered predecessor carefully pressed into its primary mass near its sensory cluster, serving as focal points for meditation on **the body** .]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - Adamant reverence for True Shards]
    *   `-  Typical Attire: [N/A for Globs. However, Shardus is often found meticulously arranging "Body  Mandalas" from found particulate matter around its resting space.]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 -  Body Mandalas]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Authenticated as a slow, resonant vibration, deeper  and more deliberate than most Globs, suggesting internal density. Speech focuses on maxims of **the Bodily Way** and pron ouncements about the sanctity of form.]` # Auth: [Implied by Adamant focus on density and seriousness]
    *    `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Authenticated to move with a deliberate, grounded quality. Often observed in prolonged,  still contact with Ratchetwork walls ("Grounding Rites") or meticulously collecting specific mineral dusts.]` # Auth:  [GCP v0.6 - Grounding Rites, Earth's Kiss]
    *   `- Associated Scent  (If Any): [Authenticated to emanate a dry, mineralic, earthy scent, akin to dust from ancient Rat chetwork sections.]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - Earth Superstition]
    *   ` # Physical Undersaturation: [Exact internal structure beyond "dense"; precise composition of absorbed minerals beyond "varied"; full  spectrum of sensory perception beyond what's implied by practices.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
    *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do, influenced by Adamant Rite practices.*
    *    `- Skill: [Authenticated as possessing profound knowledge of Adamant Rite rituals, including specific techniques for voluntary CMP restriction,  ritual self-compression, and identifying potent "Earth's Kiss" sources.]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6  - Adamant Rite Practices]
    *   `- Skill: [Authenticated as adept at interpreting "Earth Scrimshaw " (patterns on ancient Ratchetwork plates) and the crystalline structures of "True Shards" for spiritual guidance related  to **"being in the body."**]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - Adamant Epistem ology]
    *   `- Skill: [Authenticated as capable of guiding other Globs in "Grounding Rites"  and the philosophical tenets of **the importance of the body**.]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - Guardian  of the Form/Earth Keeper role]
    *   `- Ability (Unique - Kineto-Mist Interaction): [Authenticated to  exhibit slightly more controlled momentum and initial resistance to minor Ratchetwork flows/Kineto-Mist due to practiced density , a subtle physical manifestation of **"being in the body."**]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - K ineto-Mist & HARDened Globs]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Authenticated as less adaptable  to sudden, extreme fluidity requirements due to chosen HARDened state. May be more susceptible to certain types of crushing/she aring forces if their current density isn't sufficient, as opposed to Dissolution.]` # Auth: [GCP v0. 6 - Consequence of HARDening]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Authenticated as having limited understanding or patience  for the Liquescent Way's philosophy; sees it as a betrayal of **the body**. Unfamiliar with intricate  Harvester mechanics beyond their observable threat to form.]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - Adamant views  on Liquescent Way]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Authenticated difficulty in empathizing with Globs who do  not share the reverence for **the body**, potentially appearing dogmatic or unyielding.]` # Auth: [Implied by devout  nature]

    *   `-  Key Motivator: [Authenticated drive to achieve a "True Shattering," leaving behind dignified "True Shards," and to guide other  Globs towards understanding **the importance of the body**.]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - Adam ant goals]
    *   `- Key Belief: [Authenticated core belief: "**The body is sacred; its current physical  manifestation is the primary locus of being and meaning.** Dissolution is an abhorrent erasure."]` # Auth: [GCP v 0.6 - Adamant Axiology]

**4. Social /  Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's place within the  Glopratchet world's networks.*
    *   `- Official Role: [Authenticated as an "Earth Keeper" or " Guardian of the Form" (informal but highly respected leadership role) within the Adamant Rite community.]` # Auth:  [GCP v0.6 - Deontic, potential roles]
    *   `- Social Status: [ Authenticated as revered elder among Adamant followers; viewed as dangerously obstinate or pitiably deluded by Liquescent Way  adherents; largely ignored by Harvesters unless materially relevant.]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - Inter-path  views, Harvester indifference]
    *   `- Primary Affiliation: [The Adamant Rite (The Path of HARD ening / The Bodily Way)]` # Auth: [Core character concept]

    *   `# Social Undersaturation: [Specific  named acolytes or rivals; history of relationships with now-Shattered peers; interactions with Globs neutral to either  Path.]`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique  relationship to world laws.*
    *   `- Property ID: MODAL-SHARDUS-01`
         *   *Property:* `[Enhanced Embodied Resilience (Alethic/Physical Exception derived from Kineto-Mist  rule & Ritual Practice)]`
        *   *Description:* `[Authenticated to exhibit a marginally higher threshold for maintaining  form against minor environmental stressors and a slightly more controlled momentum due to lifelong adherence to Adamant Rite HARDening practices and deep  connection to "Earth Superstition." This is not supernatural, but a peak expression of authenticated Glob bio-mechanics under  specific ritual conditioning focused on **the body**.]`
        *   *Limits:* `[Does not confer immunity  to significant Ratchetwork forces or Harvester actions. The effect is subtle, primarily reinforcing their commitment to **"being in the body "** rather than granting overt physical power.]`

    *   `- Reputation (Liquescent Way): [Authenticated as the epitome of fearful  clinging to transient form, a Glob who tragically misunderstands the path to true release from **the body's** confines .]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - Liquescent values]
    *   `- Reputation (Har vesters): [Authenticated as undifferentiated Glop-matter; spiritual beliefs regarding **the body** are irrelevant except as they  affect processable material properties (e.g., density for certain harvesting methods).]` # Auth: [GCP v 0.6 - Harvester values]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via narrative potential  as a figure of tragic, profound faith, embodying the struggle to find meaning and affirm **the body** in a universe designed  to unmake it. Their righteousness is internal to their belief system.]` # Auth: [Inferred from thematic potential  of Adamant Rite]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [Reputation among "neutral" Globs ; specific Harvester sub-routines' assessment of "Adamant-type" material.]`

**7. Historical  Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events .*
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as having been a practitioner of the Adamant Rite for many Cycles, witnessing  the exhaustion of several minor "Mineral Veins" and the re-designation of new ones as sacred.]` # Auth:  [Implied by "Elder" status and Diachronic Consistency checks in GCP v0.6]
    *   `- Key  Past Event Connection: [Authenticated to have guided a small group of followers to safety during the "Great Grinding of Sector Tau -9," an event where their shared commitment to **"being in the body"** and swift application of "Grounding  Rites" against a collapsing Ratchetwork section was credited (by them) for their survival, reinforcing their faith.]`  # Auth: [Hypothetical past event consistent with Adamant beliefs]
    *   `- Inherited Items/ Knowledge:** [Authenticated to possess knowledge of specific "Earth Scrimshaw" patterns passed down from a previous "Earth Keeper ," and carries a "True Shard" from that mentor, using it in rituals to affirm **the body's** continuity through  lineage.]` # Auth: [GCP v0.6 - Adamant Epistemology, Reverence for Shards ]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Specific details of their own "awakening" to the Adamant Rite ; the identities of all past mentors; precise timeline of Ratchetwork changes witnessed.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle .*

*   **Core Essence:** `[Elder Shardus is constituted as the living embodiment of the Adamant Rite's  **Bodily Imperative**. Their being is defined by a profound, practiced commitment to physical integrity, density, and the sacred ness of their current form, reinforced by "Earth Superstition." Their Physical density, Functional knowledge of rituals, Psychological  stoicism, Social role as an Earth Keeper, and even their subtle Modal resilience are all direct textual manifestations of their unwavering  belief in **"being in the body."** They are a figure of immense, focused spiritual conviction within the indifferent machinery  of Glopratchet.]`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `[To serve as a primary exponent and exemplar  of the Adamant Rite philosophy. To act as a spiritual anchor or guide for other Adamant characters. To create dramatic tension through  their unwavering, potentially tragic, adherence to **bodily integrity** in the face of overwhelming destructive forces. To provide a key  voice in philosophical debates about existence, form, and meaning within Glopratchet.]`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts  (From Bundle):** `[Maintaining faith in **the body** amidst its constant annihilation by Glopratchet. The  tension between preserving ancient "Earth Superstition" traditions and adapting to the ever-changing, destructive Ratchetwork.  The frustration of witnessing other Globs "betray" **the importance of their bodies** by seeking Dissolution or remaining  "unbodied."]`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `[Deepening of resolve  through surviving cataclysmic events. A crisis of faith if core "Earth Superstition" sites are irrevocably lost, forcing  a reinterpretation of **"being in the body."** The challenge of passing on their embodied wisdom before their own Shattering.  Potentially facing a form of destruction that directly mocks the dignity of **the body** they so cherish, testing their faith to its  absolute limit.]`
