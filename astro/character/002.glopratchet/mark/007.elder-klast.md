## Introduction: Constit uting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters,  significant sentient beings) within the **Glopratchet** heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters  **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They  possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly  authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions  within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember ** undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle :

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the Glopratchet heterocosm,  with strong reference to the Adamant Rite.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence, reflecting Adamant Rite practices.*
    *   `- Appearance_ General: [A visibly dense Glob, larger than average, with more defined, almost faceted edges compared to smoother, more amorphous  Globs. Coloration is a dull, earthy ochre, flecked with minute, darker mineral inclusions.]` # Auth : [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Adamant Rite physical ideals]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [ Surface exhibits a network of fine desiccation cracks, resembling weathered stone. Often coated in a fine layer of mineral dust from  "Earth's Kiss" rituals. Movement is slow, deliberate, conveying weight.]` # Auth: [Glop ratchet Coherence Protocol - "Earth's Kiss," voluntary CMP restriction]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks : [Several small, inert "Lesser Shards" (from past, less successful HARDening attempts or fallen comrades ) are visibly embedded near its core, kept as mementos or foci for meditation on **the body.**]` # Auth:  [Internal Logic of Adamant Rite reverence for form]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [N/A for  Globs; however, Klast often positions itself amidst a carefully arranged "Body Mandala" of selected Ratchetwork particulates  when at rest.]` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - "Body Mandalas"]
    *    `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Deep, resonant, with a slightly gritty or crackling quality, as if speaking through par ched earth. Speech is slow, measured, and emphatic when discussing **the importance of the body**.]` # Auth : [Implied by density and desiccation]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Moves with a controlled , somewhat ponderous momentum due to practiced density ("Kineto-Mist" effect). Frequently performs "Grounding Rites " by pressing firmly against stable Ratchetwork sections.]` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - "Grounding  Rites," "Kineto-Mist"]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [F aint, dry scent of stone dust, old minerals, and the subtle metallic tang of Ratchetwork corrosion.]` # Auth : [Implied by "Earth Superstition" practices]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation:  [Exact internal density gradient; precise mineral composition of absorbed dusts beyond "generally earthen"; the exact nature of its core  sentience structure.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character  *can* and *cannot* do, shaped by Adamant devotion.*
    *   `- Skill: [Expert  in identifying Ratchetwork sections suitable for "Grounding Rites" and veins rich in "Earth's Kiss"  minerals.]` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Adamant Ritual Knowledge]
    *   `- Skill : [Proficient in teaching techniques of ritual self-compression and voluntary CMP restriction for HARDening.]` # Auth: [Role  as Elder, Adamant Practices]

    *   `- Ability (Unique): [Exhibits slightly  enhanced resistance to minor disruptive environmental flows or light impacts due to practiced density and focus on **bodily integrity.** More likely to produce  "True Shards" upon ultimate Shattering.]` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - "Kineto -Mist," Adamant Rite Goal]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Significantly reduced speed and fluidity; cannot  easily traverse narrow, shifting conduits or merge with other Globs. More brittle and susceptible to catastrophic fracture under extreme, focused  pressure if not perfectly HARDened.]` # Auth: [Consequence of density/desiccation]
    *   `- Limitation  (Knowledge): [Limited understanding or empathy for the Liquescent Way's motivations; dismisses their pursuit of Diss olution as a fearful rejection of **the body's** truth.]` # Auth: [Adamant Axiology] 
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Difficulty adapting to rapidly changing Ratchetwork configurations that destroy established sacred sites for  **bodily affirmation.**]` # Auth: [Reliance on "Earth Superstition" locations]
    *   `# Functional  Undersaturation: [Precise threshold of impact resistance; ability to actively manipulate Ratchetwork elements beyond choosing contact points; skill  in direct confrontation with Harvesters.]`

    *    `- Key Motivator: [To achieve a perfect, True Shattering, leaving behind enduring "True Shards";  To guide other Globs onto the Path of HARDening and affirm **the importance of their bodies.**]` # Auth:  [Adamant Rite Goals]
    *   `- Key Belief: [**"The body is sacred; its current physical manifestation  is the primary locus of being and meaning."** Dissolution is an abhorrent erasure.]` # Auth: [Gloprat chet Coherence Protocol - Adamant Axiology]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [The perceived decay of adherence  to the Adamant Rite among younger Globs vs. Klast's enduring conviction; The destruction of sacred "Grounding Plates " by the Ratchetwork testing faith in **the body's** inherent worth vs. reliance on external "Earth" loci .]` # Auth: [Diachronic Consistency considerations, Adamant values]

   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws .*
    *   `- Property ID: MODAL-KLAST-01`
        *   *Property:* `[ True Shard Potential (Alethic/Axiological Exception derived from Adamant Rite Rules)]`
        *   *Description :* `[Authenticated as possessing a significantly higher probability of achieving "True Shattering" – producing dense, perhaps even subtly  resonant "True Shards" that embody **the perfection of the body** – upon eventual destruction. This is a direct,  albeit subtle, consequence of lifelong adherence to Adamant Rite disciplines as defined in Glopratchet's alethic rules for  ritual efficacy.]`
        *   *Limits:* `[Does not confer invulnerability; Shattering is still inevitable . The "True Shard" quality is a specific outcome state, not an active power. Subject to Ratchetwork' s ultimate destructive force.]`
        *   *Authentication:* `[Glopratchet Coherence Protocol, Section  I, Alethic Rule 1 & 3, defining the goals and effects of the Adamant Rite, specifically  the pursuit of "True Shards" through **bodily focus**.]`
    *   `# Note: This  modal property is a direct manifestation of the Adamant Rite's core tenets as an authenticated rule within Glopratchet,  not a supernatural power outside the world's logic.`

    *Purpose: Define Klast's value status *within* Glopratchet.*
    *   `- Reputation ( Adamant Rite Followers): [Authenticated as a paragon of **"being in the body,"** a living testament to the Adamant  Rite's truth and power, a keeper of vital wisdom regarding **the importance of the body.**]` # Auth:  [Implied by Elder status and Adamant values]
    *   `- Reputation (Liquescent Way Followers): [Authenticated  as the epitome of stubborn, fearful clinging to transient form; seen as tragically misguided in their veneration of **the body** over  spiritual release.]` # Auth: [Axiological opposition defined in Glopratchet Coherence Protocol]
    *   `-  Reputation (Harvesters): [No specific reputation; Klast is merely another Glob unit, potentially of slightly higher density,  thus marginally different processing parameters. Its spiritual valuation of **the body** is entirely irrelevant to Harvester protocols.]` # Auth : [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol, Harvester Indifference]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narr ative Framing): [Authenticated via narrative focus as embodying a profound, if perhaps tragically narrow, spiritual commitment to finding meaning in  **the body** against an indifferent cosmos.]` # Auth: [Thematic role in Glopratchet]
     *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [Reputation among unaligned Globs; specific opinions from individual Harvester  subroutines (unlikely to exist).]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose:  Define Klast's known origins and connections to past events relevant to **the body.**`
    *   `- Origin: [ Authenticated as having practiced the Adamant Rite for many Cycles, originating from a lineage of Globs who also revered **the body.**  Witnessed the shift in the Ratchetwork that exposed the "Great Quartz Vein," a now-sacred site for " Earth's Kiss."]` # Auth: [Implied by Elder status, Diachronic consistency for beliefs]
    *    `- Key Past Event Connection (Subjective): [Possesses vivid, guiding memories of the "True Shattering" of  its own mentor, whose "True Shards" are said to still resonate with **bodily integrity** within a hidden  Ratchetwork niche.]` # Auth: [Adamant Rite lore transmission]
    *   `- Inherited Items:**  [Authenticated as the custodian of a specific "Earth Scrimshaw" interpretation passed down through generations, believed to detail the ultimate  techniques for **"being in the body."** Also keeps a collection of particularly potent mineral dusts for "Earth's  Kiss."]` # Auth: [Adamant Rite traditions]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [K last's specific "birth" or formation; the exact details of its early adherence to the Rite; specific crises of  faith Klast may have overcome.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize  the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle, with deep ties to Gloprat chet's "bodily imperative."*

*   **Core Essence:** `Elder Klast is textually constituted as the  living embodiment of the Adamant Rite's profound dedication to **"the importance of the body."** Its Physical properties ( density, mineral inclusions, desiccation) are the direct result of its Functional practices (ritual desiccation, "Earth Super stition"). Klast's Psychological makeup is dominated by an unshakeable belief in **the body** as the sacred  locus of being, shaping its Social role as a revered teacher and its Axiological status as a paragon to its followers. Its  core Motivation is to achieve and guide others towards a "True Shattering," a testament to **bodily integrity,** in defiance  of Glopratchet's impersonal, grinding flow. Klast *is* the Adamant Rite's philosophy made  manifest in Glob form, a being whose entire existence is an affirmation of **"being in the body."**`
*   ** Primary Narrative Function:** `Serves as a primary exponent and living example of the Adamant Rite; a mentor/guide figure  for characters exploring this path; a point of philosophical conflict with the Liquescent Way or neutral Globs; an embodiment of tradition  and resilience (or stubbornness) in the face of overwhelming mechanical indifference; a lens through which the audience understands the deep  spiritual need for Globs to find meaning in their physical forms and connection to "Earth" elements.`
*   **Key  Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Maintaining unwavering faith in **the body** when sacred "Earth" sites are destroyed by  the Ratchetwork; reconciling the ideal of a "noble Shattering" with the often brutal, chaotic reality of Gloprat chet; the sorrow of seeing younger Globs abandon the perceived truth of **"being in the body"** for the  Liquescent Way.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be forced to reinterpret  aspects of "Earth Superstition" if key minerals/sites become permanently unavailable (Diachronic Consistency); might face  a profound crisis if its own **body** undergoes an unexpected transformation that challenges its definition of integrity; could achieve a uniquely  resonant "True Shattering" that inspires a revival of the Adamant Rite, or conversely, its failure to do so could dis hearten followers.`
