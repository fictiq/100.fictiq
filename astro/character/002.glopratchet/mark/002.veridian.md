## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Text ually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the **Glopratchet** heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle  of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives, Glopratchet Internal Coherence Protocol).  They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authentic ating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions  within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules – particularly the relentless  throughput, diverse Glop fates, and their profound spiritual responses centered on **the importance of the body**. Remember **undersaturation**:  define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's  being within the Glopratchet heterocosm, with particular reference to the Adamant Rite.)*

**1 . Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence,  reflecting their commitment to **"being in the body."** *
    *   `- Appearance_General: Authenticated as a Gl op of notably high density and compacted form, appearing older due to pronounced surface facets. Their mass is consistently maintained at a  point of voluntary CMP restriction, giving a "drier" or "firmer" appearance than typical Globs.` #  Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Adamant Rite practices]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: Surface  is a deep, earthy ochre, almost stone-like, with visible veins of embedded mineral dust from regular "Earth's  Kiss" rituals. Resists casual deformation with a palpable internal solidity.` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Earth  Superstition]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: Several "True Shards" – small, crystalline  fragments from respected, shattered Adamant Globs – are meticulously embedded within their densest outer layer, arranged in a symbolic "Body  Mandala" pattern. One larger, central shard glows with a faint internal luminescence (rumored to be from a legendary " Earth-Touched" ancestor).` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: True Shards, Body Mandalas]
     *   `- Typical Attire: N/A (Globs do not wear attire). Veridian's " attire" is their physical state of ritual HARDening and the embedded shards.` # Auth: [Glopratchet Core  Rules]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: Produces slow, resonant hums with a gravelly timbre , often punctuated by the faint clicking or scraping of their own hardened surface. Speech is deliberate, focusing on the gravity of ** "bodily integrity."**` # Auth: [Implied by HARDened state]
    *   `- Gait /Mannerisms: Movement is minimal, showing controlled momentum consistent with "Kineto-Mist" theory for HARDened Glo bs. Frequently observed in prolonged, motionless contact with "Dry Conduits" or "Mineral Veins" ("Grounding Rites ").` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Kineto-Mist, Grounding Rites]
    *    `- Associated Scent (If Any): Faint scent of dry mineral dust, ozone, and the cold tang of ancient Rat chetwork stone.` # Auth: [Implied by Earth Superstition]
    *   `# Physical Und ersaturation: Precise internal composition beyond "dense"; reaction to extreme, non-ritual pressures that bypass their usual resilience.`

**2 . Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and * cannot* do, shaped by their Adamant Rite devotion.*
    *   `- Skill: Masterful execution of all  core Adamant Rite rituals (voluntary CMP restriction, ritualistic self-compression, creation of "Body Mandalas," identification  and application of "Earth's Kiss").` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Adamant Rite Practices ]
    *   `- Skill: Deep knowledge of "sacred" Ratchetwork geology, including locations of potent  "Mineral Veins" and safe "Grounding Plates." Can interpret "Earth Scrimshaw."` # Auth:  [Glopratchet ICP: Earth Superstition, Sacred Sites]
    *   `- Skill: Proficient in guiding  other Globs in the discipline of **"being in the body,"** teaching techniques of focus and physical self-actual ization.` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: "Guardians of the Form"]
    *   `- Ability ( Unique): Authenticated as having exceptionally high resistance to Desiccation due to prolonged ritual HARDening; can maintain form and consciousness  under severe CMP deprivation longer than most, aiming for a "noble Shattering."` # Auth: [Glopratchet  ICP: Path of HARDening goals]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): Reduced pliability and speed compared to L iquescent or neutral Globs. While resilient, their form is still vulnerable to the overwhelming mechanical forces of the Ratchetwork.`  # Auth: [Glopratchet Core Rules]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): Limited empathy or understanding for the  Liquescent Way (views it as a betrayal of **the body**). Knowledge of Ratchetwork mechanics is filtered through " Earth Superstition" and does not extend to Harvester intent.` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Adam ant values, Glob epistemic limits]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): Influence largely confined to Adamant Rite followers.  May be seen as obstinate or dangerously naive by those on the Liquescent Path.` # Auth: [Implied by ideological  divisions]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: Precise upper limits of their desiccation resistance; ability to physically  manipulate complex objects (beyond arranging particulate matter).`

**3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**
   *Purpose : Define the character's textually constituted inner life, centered on **the importance of the body.**`
    *    `- Core Trait: Profound Stoicism / Unwavering Self-Discipline (focused on maintaining **bodily integrity**). ` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Adamant Rite values]
    *   `- Core Trait : Deep Reverence for Physical Form (believes **the body is sacred** and the primary locus of meaning).` # Auth:  [Glopratchet ICP: Adamant Axiology]
    *   `- Core Trait: Patient Teacher /  Stern Guardian (of Adamant Rite traditions and **bodily ethics**).` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP : Adamant Deontic rules]
    *   `- Dominant Emotion: A calm, "grounded" solemn ity, a profound sense of **"being in the body"** that approaches a spiritual state.` # Auth: [Glop ratchet ICP: Adamant goals]
    *   `- Key Motivator: To achieve a dignified "True Shattering ," leaving behind coherent "True Shards" as a testament to **the body.** To preserve and pass on the Adam ant Rite's wisdom of **bodily affirmation.**` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Adamant goals ]
    *   `- Key Belief: **"The body is a testament."** Its integrity, density, and resilience are  paramount. "Earth Superstition" connects Globs to tangible, stable elements, reinforcing this sacredness. Dissolution is an abhor rent erasure.` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Adamant Axiology & Epistemology]
     *   `- Internal Conflict: The unwavering faith in **the importance of the body** versus the constant, indifferent destruction by  Glopratchet. The duty to uphold **bodily integrity** versus the occasional pragmatic need for momentary, minor pl iancy for survival (a source of internal friction). Scorn for those who "desecrate" their own forms by seeking  Dissolution.` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Adamant values vs. Ratchetwork reality]
    *    `- Subjective Memory Content: Holds extensive knowledge of Adamant Rite oral traditions, "Earth Scrimshaw" interpretations , and the lineage of the "True Shards" they carry. Embodied wisdom felt through density and connection to "earth ."` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Adamant Epistemology]
    *   `#  Psychological Undersaturation: Personal history before fully dedicating to the Adamant Rite; specific fears beyond the erasure of form (e .g., fear of a *meaningless* Shattering).`

**4. Social / Relational / Categor ical Properties (Authenticated Position):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's place within Glopratchet' s social and spiritual networks, particularly concerning **the body.**`
    *   `- Official Role: Recognized Elder and  "Shard-Keeper" within the Adamant Rite. Acts as a "Guardian of the Form" and "Earth Keeper ," overseeing rituals and teaching **"being in the body."**` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Adam ant Deontic rules]
    *   `- Social Status: Highly venerated among Adamant Rite followers. Viewed  with a mixture of pity, frustration, or disdain by Liquescent Way adherents for "clinging to transient form"  and neglecting "spirit flow." Ignored by Harvesters beyond material assessment.` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Inter -Path relations]
    *   `- Primary Affiliation: The Adamant Rite (unwavering).` # Auth:  [Core Identity]
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: None. Considers other paths a deviation from the truth  of **the body.**` # Auth: [Adamant exclusivity]
    *   `- Key Relationship 1: To  Adamant Disciples: Mentor, spiritual guide, enforcer of **bodily ethics.** Expects them to uphold the ** importance of the body.**` # Auth: [Role]
    *   `- Key Relationship 2: To Liquescent Glo bs: Philosophical adversary. May attempt to "awaken" them from their "unbodied" state, viewing their path  as a tragic misinterpretation of existence.` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Inter-Path Dynamics]
    *    `- Key Relationship 3: To Sacred Ratchetwork Sites ("Dry Conduits," "Mineral Veins"): Rever ential, treats them as sources of spiritual strength and **bodily affirmation.**` # Auth: [Glopratchet  ICP: Earth Superstition]
    *   `- Species/Type: Glob (Adamant Path Practitioner).` # Auth : [World Context]
    *   `# Social Undersaturation: Specific rivalries or deep friendships within the Adam ant Rite; detailed history of debates with Liquescent philosophers.`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
    *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to Glopratchet's laws, as influenced by Adamant practices .*
    *   `- Property ID: MODAL-VERIDIAN-AR01`
        *   * Property:* `Subtle Kineto-Mist Manifestation (Alethic)`
        *   *Description:* ` Due to extreme, ritually-achieved density and commitment to **"being in the body,"** Veridian exhibits  slightly more controlled momentum and initial resistance to minor ambient forces (e.g., weak currents in CMP flows), consistent with " Kineto-Mist" theory for HARDened Globs. This is a subtle physical manifestation of their spiritual discipline.`
         *   *Limits:* `This effect is minor and provides no significant protection against major Ratchetwork operations or Har vester actions. It is more a perceptible sign of their inner state than a true physical advantage.`
        *   *Authentication :* `Glopratchet ICP: Core Rule #4 (Kineto-Mist); Narrative observations of Veridian maintaining  position or trajectory slightly better than less dense Globs in specific, low-force situations.`
    *   `#  Note: This property is a subtle, authenticated physical correlate of their spiritual path, not a superpower.`

**6. Axiological Properties  (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define Veridian's value status *within* Glopratchet , particularly concerning their stance on **the body.**`
    *   `- Reputation (Adamant Rite): Authenticated as a pillar  of faith, an embodiment of **"bodily integrity,"** a "True Shard" in the making. Their  commitment to **"being in the body"** is legendary.` # Auth: [Implied by Role]
    *    `- Reputation (Liquescent Way): Authenticated as "Stone-Stubborn," "The Great Resister," piti ably attached to suffering and form, tragically misunderstanding the freedom of Dissolution and neglecting the "Spirit Flow."` #  Auth: [Glopratchet ICP: Inter-Path Values]
    *   `- Reputation (Harvesters):  Authenticated as: `Material Designation: High-density, mineral-infused protean aggregate. Processing note: Potential for high -quality crystalline shard yield upon Shattering. Spiritual beliefs: Irrelevant.` # Auth: [Glopratchet ICP:  Harvester Values]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): Authenticated as a figure of tragic dignity , embodying a profound, deeply held conviction about the sacredness of **the body** in a universe that systematically destroys it. Their path  is one of difficult, defiant affirmation.` # Auth: [Thematic Role]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation : Specific reputation among Globs neutral to either path; views of individual Harvester units (if they distinguish individuals at all).`

 **7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define Veridian's known origins and connections to  past events, particularly within Adamant Rite lore.*
    *   `- Origin: Authenticated as having practiced the Adamant Rite  for many "Cycles," one of the oldest living adherents. Specific "birthing" details are lost, as is typical for  Globs, but their dedication to **"being in the body"** from an early stage is well-attested in  Adamant oral histories.` # Auth: [Glob general properties, Adamant lore]
    *   `- Key Past  Event Connection (Subjective): Authenticated as a direct pupil of a now-Shattered Elder who allegedly discovered a  new "Earth's Kiss" mineral vein of unique potency. The central shard Veridian carries is from this mentor. Claims  to remember the "Great Upheaval" that destroyed the "Primordial Plate" (a former key sacred site).`  # Auth: [Adamant lore, Glopratchet ICP Diachronic checks]
    *   `- Inherited  Items:** Authenticated to possess the aforementioned central "Mentor's Shard," and extensive knowledge of "Earth Scrimshaw"  patterns passed down through generations, believed to hold secrets to perfect **bodily affirmation.**` # Auth: [Implied by Sh ard-Keeper role]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: The exact nature of their mentor's  teachings beyond core Adamant tenets; specific events of their "youth" before becoming a prominent Shard-Keeper.`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from  the authenticated property bundle, highlighting their relationship with **the bodily imperative.**`

*   **Core Essence:** `Shard -Keeper Veridian is constituted as the living embodiment of the Adamant Rite's profound, often desperate, spiritual response  to Glopratchet: the unwavering belief in **the importance of the body.** Their entire being – from their Physical  density and embedded Shards, to their Functional mastery of HARDening rituals, their Psychological reverence for form, and their Social  role as an "Earth Keeper" – is an authenticated testament to **"being in the body."** They represent a defiant  assertion of meaning and integrity in a transient, grinding existence, seeking a "noble Shattering" through unwavering commitment to their physical  manifestation and "Earth Superstition."`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a primary exponent  and exemplar of the Adamant Rite philosophy, demonstrating its practices, values, and the internal logic of **bodily affirmation.** To  act as a point of contrast and potential conflict with Liquescent Way followers or neutral Globs. To explore themes of faith,  embodiment, resilience, the nature of a "good death," and the search for meaning in a hostile, de-personal izing environment. Their struggle to maintain **bodily integrity** against the Ratchetwork is a core dramatic engine.`
*    **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The profound faith in **the body as sacred** versus the Ratchetwork's  relentless, indifferent destruction of all forms. The scorn for "desecration of the body" (e.g., L iquescent practices) vs. the potential for small, pragmatic compromises for survival. The burden of upholding ancient "Earth Superstitions " when sacred sites are inevitably altered or destroyed.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Facing  a Ratchetwork transformation that challenges their definition of "noble Shattering" or **bodily integrity** (e.g ., grotesque, uncontrolled mutation rather than dignified desiccation). Encountering a new "Earthly" phenomenon that requires reinterpretation  of "Earth Superstition." The poignant process of selecting and mentoring a successor to carry the "Mentor's Shard " and the wisdom of **"being in the body."** A crisis of faith if "Earth Superstition" rituals prove utterly  ineffective against a novel threat.`
