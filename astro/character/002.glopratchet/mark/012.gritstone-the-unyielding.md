##  Introduction: Constituting Glopratchet's Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **F ictional Persons** (primarily Globs, but potentially Harvesters or other sentient entities if narratively significant) within  the Glopratchet heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle  of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche  or reality beyond this textual definition.** This protocol is specifically tailored to the realities of Glopratchet, including the amorphous  nature of Globs, their varying CMP states, their profound spiritual responses (The Adamant Rite's "Bodily Imperative"  and The Liquescent Way's "Spirit Flow"), and their existence within the indifferent, grinding Ratchetworks.*

* Use this template to systematically build Glob characters by explicitly authenticating their properties. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the ** richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature,  their chosen (or unchosen) spiritual path, and Glopratchet's unforgiving rules. Remember **undersaturation**:  define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined regarding their amorphous forms or fragmented histories.*

### Glob Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle, grounded  in Glopratchet's unique spiritual and physical landscape.*

*   **Core Essence:** `[Summarize the Glob  based on the interplay of their key authenticated properties. e.g., Gritstone is constituted as an embodiment of the Adam ant Rite's "Bodily Imperative." His Physical density and "Earth's Kiss"-dusted form are tangible manifestations  of his Psychological commitment to "being in the body." His Functional resilience (minor resistance to dispersal) is an authenticated outcome of his rituals , while his limitations (slow movement) are accepted facets of his path. His Social role as an "Earth Keeper" reinforces  his beliefs and dictates his interactions. He represents the struggle to find meaning and preserve identity through bodily integrity against the overwhelming,  de-personalizing forces of Glopratchet.]`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `[e.g., Prot agonist embodying the Adamant Rite's philosophy; Antagonist representing the Liquescent Way's opposing view; Mentor  figure passing on "Earth Superstitions"; Foil to a Glob struggling with their faith/form; Victim highlighting the brutality  of the Ratchetwork.]`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle & Path):** `[e.g.,  Adamant: Upholding "Bodily Integrity" vs. overwhelming destructive force of Ratchetwork; Faith in "Earth Superst ition" vs. apparent futility. Liquescent: Innate survival instinct vs. desire for Dissolution; Patience  for achieving "perfect flow" vs. immediate threats. General: Hope vs. Despair in the face of the Grinding Flow .]`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle & Glopratchet Dynamics):** `[Where can  authenticated properties plausibly change? e.g., Deepening of faith (Psychological) or crisis of faith due to Rat chetwork events; Acquisition of new ritual knowledge (Functional/Historical); Shift in spiritual path (Psychological/Social change ); Physical alteration due to extreme environmental pressure or partial/failed ritual outcome (Physical/Functional change).]`
