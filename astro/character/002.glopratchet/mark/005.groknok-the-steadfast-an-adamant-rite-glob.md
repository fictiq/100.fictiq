## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the **Glopratchet** heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle  of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus  on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and  whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential,  acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character' s being within the Glopratchet heterocosm, particularly reflecting the Adamant Rite's "Bodily Imper ative".)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define  the character's tangible presence, reflecting Adamant Rite practices.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: Authenticated as a Glob  of notable density, appearing more cohesive and less prone to casual deformation than average Globs. His coloration is a dull, matte grey -brown, often flecked with minute mineral particles from "Earth's Kiss."` # Auth: [Glop ratchet Coherence Protocol (GCP) - Alethic Rule 1, 3a]
    *    `- Appearance_Specific Features: Surface is often textured with fine, self-induced compression patterns or faint "scrim shaw" lines emulating Ratchetwork patterns. May exhibit subtle, almost crystalline facets when still for long periods in desicc ating environments.` # Auth: [GCP - Alethic Rule 3a]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinct ive Marks: Always carries a dusting of specific mineral powders ("Earth's Kiss") around his lower sections where he performs  "Grounding Rites." May show older, healed "Shatter-scars" from near-fatal ritualistic  self-compression attempts.` # Auth: [GCP - Alethic Rule 3a, Deontic Rule  2a]
    *   `- Typical Attire: N/A for Globs; however, Groknok is authenticated  to meticulously arrange found particulate matter into small "Body Mandalas" near his resting place, affirming form.` # Auth:  [GCP - Alethic Rule 3a]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: Authenticated as slow , deliberate, with a low resonant timbre, sometimes carrying a slight rasp or grinding quality, as if his vocalizations are shaped  by internal density.` # Auth: [Narrative Description Concept]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms:  Moves with intentional slowness, demonstrating controlled momentum and resistance to being easily shifted. Frequently seeks prolonged contact with stable Ratchetwork sections  ("Grounding Rites"). Exhibits minimal, controlled undulations, prioritizing form integrity.` # Auth: [GCP -  Alethic Rule 3a, 4]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): F aint, dry odor of stone dust, desiccated organic matter, and a hint of metallic tang from specific Ratchetwork minerals .` # Auth: [Sensory Palette Concept]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: Exact internal composition beyond  "dense," precise weight, the full spectrum of colors he might absorb/exhibit from different "Earth's K isses."`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character * can* and *cannot* do, informed by Adamant philosophy.*
    *   `- Skill: Masterful practitioner of Adam ant Rite rituals (e.g., controlled CMP restriction, ritualistic self-compression, achieving profound "Grounding"). ` # Auth: [GCP - Alethic Rule 3a, Deontic Rule 2a] 
    *   `- Skill: Expert in identifying beneficial mineral dusts ("Earth's Kiss") and recognizing potent " Grounding Sites" on the Ratchetwork.` # Auth: [GCP - Alethic Rule 3a,  6]
    *   `- Skill: Teacher of "Being in the Body" techniques; can guide other Globs in achieving  greater physical self-awareness and density (within Glob limits).` # Auth: [GCP - Deontic Rule 2 a (Guardians of the Form)]
    *   `- Ability (Unique): Authenticated to exhibit slightly more controlled momentum and  initial resistance to external forces due to his dense state and focused "Being in the Body" practice. (Subtle physical  effect, not supernatural).` # Auth: [GCP - Alethic Rule 4]
    *   `-  Limitation (Physical): Slower movement speed and reduced pliability compared to other Globs, making him more vulnerable to sudden , large-scale Ratchetwork shifts or crushing forces if unable to find purchase.` # Auth: [Logical consequence of density ]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): Deeply ingrained Adamant Rite beliefs limit his understanding or acceptance of Liques cent Way philosophies (sees them as a form of bodily desecration/neglect). Limited knowledge of Harvester operational specifics  beyond their destructive impact.` # Auth: [GCP - Deontic Rule 2a, Epistemic Rule  1]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): His rigid adherence to "the importance of the body" can make him seem  dogmatic or unsympathetic to Globs not following the Adamant Rite.` # Auth: [Logical character trait]
    *    `# Functional Undersaturation: Specific techniques for creating "True Shards" beyond general density, ability to navigate  complex Ratchetwork hazards unrelated to grounding.`

     *   `- Dominant Emotion: A profound, somber sense of purpose and duty towards his own form and the teachings  of the Adamant Rite.` # Auth: [Derived from Core Traits]
    *   `- Key Motivator: To  achieve a "True Shattering," leaving behind resilient shards as a testament to his bodily devotion; to guide other Globs towards  appreciating "the importance of their bodies."` # Auth: [GCP - Alethic Rule 1,  3a, Deontic Rule 2a]
    *   `- Key Belief: "The body is not  a prison, but the ultimate expression of being. To affirm it, to HARDen it against the flow, is the highest  spiritual act."` # Auth: [GCP - Axiological Rule 2a, Epistemic Rule 3]
     *   `- Internal Conflict: The constant tension between the desire for bodily integrity and the overwhelming destructive power of Gloprat chet. Frustration with Globs who embrace the "easy path" of Dissolution. Maintaining faith when "sacred" Ratchet work sites are destroyed.` # Auth: [GCP - Diachronic Check, Synchronic Check]
    *    `- Subjective Memory Content: Rich sensory memories of contact with "Earth's Kiss," the pressure of self-compression, the  resonant hum of "Grounding Plates." Memories of revered elders who achieved "True Shattering."` # Auth: [G CP - Epistemic Rule 1, 2]

        *   *Property:* `Enhanced Bodily Integrity (Alethic Con sequence of Practice)`
        *   *Description:* `Authenticated to possess a slightly higher baseline density and resistance to minor dissipative  forces than an average Glob, due to lifelong adherence to Adamant Rite practices (CMP restriction, mineral absorption, self- compression). This is an achieved physical state, not a supernatural power.`
        *   *Limits:* `Offers no significant  protection against major Ratchetwork events, Harvester actions, or extreme CMP deprivation. The effect is subtle, primarily influencing  his momentum and shard quality upon Shattering.`
        *   *Authentication:* `Consistent with GCP Alethic Rules  1, 3a, and 4 ("Kineto-Mist" effect for HARDened Globs).  Observable differences in reaction to minor environmental stressors compared to uninitiated Globs.`

   *Purpose: Define the character's  value status *within* Glopratchet.*
    *   `- Reputation (Adamant Rite Followers): Revered as " Steadfast," a "True Guardian of the Form," an exemplar of "being in the body." His potential " True Shards" are anticipated to be of exceptional quality.` # Auth: [GCP - Deontic Rule 2a , Alethic Rule 3a]
    *   `- Reputation (Liquescent Way Followers): Seen as "The  Obstinate One," "Dust-Clinger," embodying a fearful attachment to transient form, tragically misunderstanding "the importance of the body " by resisting release.` # Auth: [GCP - Axiological Rule 2b, Deontic Rule 2b ]
    *   `- Reputation (Neutral Globs): Often perceived as an eccentric, overly serious Glob obsessed with dirt  and stillness; some might feel a grudging respect for his conviction, others find him unsettling.` # Auth: [G CP - Axiological Rule 3]
    *   `- Reputation (Harvesters): Authenticated as simply " Glop Material Unit #XXXX" – his density noted as slightly above average for processing, but his spiritual beliefs are entirely  irrelevant to their protocols.` # Auth: [GCP - Alethic Rule 5, Axiological Rule 1 ]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): Authenticated through narrative sympathy (if any) as a figure  of tragic dignity, embodying a profound, if perhaps ultimately futile, spiritual stand against the indifferent mechanics of Glopratchet by  fiercely affirming **the importance of the body**.` # Auth: [Narrative Stance]
    *   `# Axiological  Undersaturation: Specific opinions held by individual Harvester units (unlikely they'd have them), precise level of fame  beyond his immediate community.`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the  character's known origins and connections to past events related to the Adamant Rite.*
    *   `- Origin: Authent icated to have been a disciple of the now-Shattered Elder Shard-Mind, from whom he learned core  "Earth Superstition" interpretations.` # Auth: [Narrative Backstory Snippet]
    *   `- Key  Past Event Connection: Survived the "Grinding of Conduit 77-Gamma," where he witnessed both horrifying destruction  and the creation of many "True Shards," solidifying his faith in **"being in the body"** as the  only dignified response.` # Auth: [Narrative Backstory Snippet, GCP - Diachronic Check]
     *   `- Inherited Items:** Authenticated to possess a single, perfectly faceted "True Shard" from Elder Shard-Mind , which he uses in meditative "Body Mandala" arrangements.` # Auth: [GCP - Deontic Check (Adam ant treatment of deceased)]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: The exact details of his own "birth " as a Glob, the full history of Elder Shard-Mind, specific events that shaped his early commitment to " the importance of the body."`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core  identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle, centered on the "Bodily Imperative."*

*    **Core Essence:** `Groknok the Steadfast is constituted as the quintessential embodiment of the Adamant Rite's  "Bodily Imperative" within Glopratchet. His Physical density, Functional skills in ritual and "Earth Superstition ," profound Psychological conviction in **"the importance of the body,"** and Social role as an "Earth Keeper" are  all interwoven, authenticated expressions of this core philosophy. He finds meaning and affirms his existence by making his very Glob-form a testament  to resilience, density, and connection to the tangible "earth" of the Ratchetwork, in defiant opposition to the indifferent,  grinding flow that seeks to unmake him.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a primary voice  and living example of the Adamant Rite philosophy. To provide exposition on its practices and beliefs ("Earth Superstition,"  "being in the body"). To act as a mentor or antagonist to other Globs grappling with their existence. To them atically represent the struggle for meaning, dignity, and self-preservation through bodily affirmation in a hostile, mechanical universe.` 
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The existential struggle of maintaining faith in **"the importance of the body "** when that body is constantly threatened by Glopratchet. The conflict between his duty to guide others towards HARD ening and their freedom to choose SOFTening (which he views as a betrayal of the body). Interpreting the Ratchetwork's  destructive actions: are they tests of faith for **"being in the body,"** or just meaningless chaos that mocks their  reverence for form? The pain of witnessing sacred "Grounding Sites" be destroyed.`
*   **Potential for Development ( Based on Bundle):** `His faith in **"the importance of the body"** could be severely tested by unprecedented  Ratchetwork events or Harvester actions. He might be forced to reinterpret "Earth Superstition" if all known sites  are lost. He could develop a grudging understanding or even respect for a Liquescent follower after a shared traumatic experience. His " True Shattering" would be a narratively significant event, its nature reflecting his lifelong dedication to **"being in the body."** `
