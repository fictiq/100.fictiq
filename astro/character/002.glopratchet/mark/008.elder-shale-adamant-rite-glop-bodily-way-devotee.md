# Based on Doležel's Heter ocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

**World:** Glopratchet

## Introduction: Constituting Fict ional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings)  within the Glopratchet heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the ** bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus  on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and  whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential,  acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the  specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties ( Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence, reflecting its adherence to  "being in the body."*
    *   `- Appearance_General: A Glop of significant apparent density and unusually  stable form, larger than average. Edges are more defined than typical Globs, reflecting a life dedicated to HARDening.` # Auth : [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Adamant Rite Practices, This Codex]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific  Features: Surface texture is matte and somewhat coarse, reminiscent of weathered stone. Coloration is primarily a deep, mottled grey with  ochre and rust-colored inclusions, possibly from prolonged contact with "Mineral Veins." Fine "Earth's Kiss " dust often clings to its surface.` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - "Earth Superstition," This  Codex]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: Several small, perfectly formed "True Shards" ( from revered predecessors) are respectfully embedded into its outer layer, serving as focal points for meditation on **bodily integrity**.  Faint, deliberate striations on its surface might resemble "Earth Scrimshaw" patterns.` # Auth: [Glopratchet  Coherence Protocol - Adamant treatment of "True Shards," Epistemic rules, This Codex]
    *    `- Typical Attire: N/A for Globs; its physical form *is* its testament to **the importance of the body **.` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Glop nature]
    *   `- Voice/ Speech Pattern: Slow, resonant, with a slightly gritty timbre. Speech is measured, often employing metaphors of stone, grounding , and structural integrity. Frequently references **"being in the body"** or **"the body's truth."**`  # Auth: [This Codex - reflecting Adamant values]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: Moves  with deliberate, controlled momentum, favoring contact with solid Ratchetwork sections. Often observed in prolonged "Grounding Rites"  or meticulously arranging "Body Mandalas." Displays minimal unnecessary undulation.` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol -  Adamant Rite Practices, "Kineto-Mist" properties]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any ): Dry, mineral dust; faint metallic tang of Ratchetwork; a hint of desiccation (controlled, not critical ).` # Auth: [This Codex - consistent with "Earth Superstition"]
    *   `# Physical  Undersaturation: Precise internal composition beyond "dense"; specific sensory organs (Globs perceive, but form is amorphous).`

** 2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot * do, especially in relation to Adamant Rite practices.*
    *   `- Skill: Masterful knowledge and execution  of Adamant Rite rituals (Voluntary CMP restriction, self-compression, "Grounding Rites," "Earth's  Kiss" application, "Body Mandala" creation).` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Adam ant Rite Practices]
    *   `- Skill: Ability to identify beneficial "Mineral Veins," "Dry Conduits,"  and potential "True Shard" quality with high accuracy (based on Adamant lore).` # Auth: [Gl opratchet Coherence Protocol - Adamant Rite beliefs/knowledge]
    *   `- Skill: Experienced teacher of  **"being in the body"** techniques to younger/less experienced Adamant Globs.` # Auth: [Gl opratchet Coherence Protocol - "Guardians of the Form" concept]
    *   `- Ability (Unique): Exhibits  enhanced Kineto-Mist effect; greater initial resistance to external forces due to extreme density and unwavering focus on **bod ily integrity.**` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - "Kineto-Mist" & Adamant focus ]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): Slower than average Glop movement due to density and deliberate manner.  Requires periodic access to specific desiccating environments or "Mineral Veins" to maintain optimal (ritual) density.` # Auth: [ This Codex - logical consequence of Adamant practices]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): Dogmatically dismissive of Liquescent  Way philosophy; limited understanding of Harvester operational details beyond their destructive impact on **bodies**.` # Auth: [Gloprat chet Coherence Protocol - Inter-Path views, Glob epistemic limits]
    *   `- Limitation (Social):  Can be perceived as inflexible or uncompassionate by Globs not adhering to the Adamant Rite's strictures on  **the body.**` # Auth: [This Codex - logical consequence of strong belief]
    *   `# Functional  Undersaturation: Ability to manipulate complex Ratchetwork mechanisms; exact limits of resilience before Shattering (highly variable,  depends on ritual state).`

**3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**
   *Purpose: Define  the character's textually constituted inner life, centered on the **bodily imperative.**`
    *   `- Core Trait : Unshakeable Faith in the Adamant Rite and **the importance of the body.**` # Auth: [Gloprat chet Coherence Protocol - Adamant Axiology]
    *   `- Core Trait: Profound Stoicism and  Resilience (mental/spiritual, reflected physically).` # Auth: [This Codex - consistent with Adamant values]
     *   `- Core Trait: Deep Reverence for "Earth" (Ratchetwork elements) as foundational to ** bodily meaning.**` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - "Earth Superstition"]
     *   `- Dominant Emotion: Solemn Conviction; Serene Determination (even in the face of destruction).` # Auth : [This Codex - fitting for an elder]
    *   `- Key Motivator: To achieve a perfect,  "True Shard" Shattering; to preserve and propagate Adamant Rite traditions; to guide others in affirming **the body.** ` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Adamant goals]
    *   `- Key Belief : "**The body is sacred.** Its current physical form is the ultimate locus of being. Integrity, density, and a  controlled Shattering are the highest spiritual achievements."` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Adamant Axiology] 
    *   `- Internal Conflict: Maintaining unwavering faith in **the body's** sanctity when sacred "Grounding Plates " are destroyed or "Mineral Veins" exhausted by the Ratchetwork. The tension between the ideal of perfect ** bodily integrity** and the relentless, indifferent forces of Glopratchet.` # Auth: [Glopratchet  Coherence Protocol - Diachronic checks, This Codex]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: Vast repository  of Adamant lore, genealogies of "True Shards," locations of (often former) sacred sites, sensory memories  of countless "Grounding Rites" and the textures of "Earth's Kiss."` # Auth: [Gloprat chet Coherence Protocol - Adamant Epistemology]
    *   `# Psychological Undersaturation: Specific personal  history pre-dating full Adamant commitment (if any); nuanced emotional responses beyond stoicism (though grief/anger might manifest  as renewed dedication to **the body**).`

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position ):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's place within Glopratchet's networks, particularly within the  Adamant Rite.*
    *   `- Official Role: Elder and "Earth Keeper" within the Adamant Rite community .` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Deontic rules]
    *   `- Social Status : Highly revered among Adamant followers; viewed as dogmatic, pitiable, or dangerously misguided by Liquescent Way  adherents.` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Inter-Path Axiology]
    *   `- Primary  Affiliation: The Adamant Rite (unquestioned, total).` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *    `- Secondary Affiliations: None; its identity is wholly consumed by the Adamant Rite's focus on **the body.**`  # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Key Relationship 1: To [e.g., CHAR _GLOP_Pebble_01, a young Adamant disciple]: Mentor, guide in the ways of **" being in the body."**` # Auth: [To be developed in narrative; example]
    *   `- Key  Relationship 2: To [e.g., CHAR_GLOP_Mistral_01, a Liques cent Way proselytizer]: Philosophical antagonist, embodying the rejection of **the body.**` # Auth: [To be developed ; example based on Glopratchet Coherence Protocol]
    *   `- Key Relationship 3: To specific , ancient Ratchetwork sections ("The Silent Slab," "The Ochre Vein"): Objects of veneration, sites  for "Grounding Rites," sources of "Earth's Kiss."` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence  Protocol - "Sacred Sites"]
    *   `- Species/Type: Glop (Adamant-Aspected  Manifestation).` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Core Rules]
    *   `#  Social Undersaturation: Specific kin-like bonds (Globs don't reproduce traditionally); precise hierarchy among Adamant Elders  if multiple exist.`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose: Define any inherent  unique relationship to world laws, stemming from its deep **bodily focus.**`
    *   `- Property ID: MODAL -SHALE-01`
        *   *Property:* `Subtle "Earth Attunement" ( Alethic/Epistemic Exception, minor)`
        *   *Description:* `Authenticated through consistent success,  Elder Shale possesses a slightly enhanced ability to sense subtle variations in Ratchetwork material composition or structural stability. This aids in locating  new sources of beneficial "Mineral Dusts" or stable "Grounding Plates" crucial for **"being in the body." ** Not a magical sense, but a highly developed experiential understanding interpreted as a spiritual gift.`
        *   *Limits:* `Short -range, intuitive, requires focused ritual state ("Grounding"). Cannot predict large-scale Ratchetwork shifts, only assess  immediate local conditions. Can be misleading if Ratchetwork composition is novel.`
        *   *Authentication:* `Narrative demonstration  of finding resources; Glopratchet Coherence Protocol Consistency Check Question (Alethic): "Do the 'Grounding Rites ' ... have any authenticated, albeit minor, physical effect...?" - this leans towards psychological reinforcement but allows for subtle,  experientially derived sensitivities.`
    *   `# Note: This reinforces the "Earth Superstition" aspect  without granting overt supernatural powers, consistent with the subtle influence principle.`

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation): **
   *Purpose: Define the character's value status *within* Glopratchet, especially concerning ** the body.**`
    *   `- Reputation (Adamant Rite): Revered as a living testament to **the importance of the  body,** a font of ancestral wisdom, a "Guardian of the Form."` # Auth: [Glopratchet  Coherence Protocol - Adamant Values]
    *   `- Reputation (Liquescent Way): Seen as the epitome of fearful  clinging to transient form, a symbol of resistance to the true release of Dissolution, tragically misunderstanding **the body's** imper manence.` # Auth: [Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Liquescent Values]
    *    `- Reputation (Neutral Globs): May be viewed with awe for its conviction, or as an extreme example of a difficult  path; its unwavering focus on **the body** can be intimidating.` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `-  Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): Authenticated via narrative focus as embodying a profound, if arguably futile, spiritual discipline centered  on **bodily integrity** and finding meaning in form against an indifferent, form-destroying universe.` # Auth: [ This Codex, reflecting Glopratchet themes]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: How Harves ters specifically perceive its density (likely just "high-quality solid material" if it Shatters well).`

** 7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events , reinforcing its **bodily lineage.**`
    *   `- Origin: Authenticated as existing for "many Cycles" within  Glopratchet. Its specific point of coalescence is lost, but its lineage of Adamant teaching is traceable through oral  tradition and the "True Shards" it venerates.` # Auth: [This Codex, consistent with Glop longevity  and Adamant oral traditions]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection: Authenticated as a survivor of "The Great Cr ushing of Sector Tau-7," where a major Adamant Rite sacred site ("The Pillar of Unyielding Form") was obliterated . This event intensified its dedication to preserving **the body's** dignity and Adamant principles.` # Auth: [ This Codex - example of diachronic impact]
    *   `- Inherited Items (Integrated): Besides embedded "True Shards ," its very composition contains trace elements from now-exhausted "Mineral Veins" that were sacred to past generations,  a literal embodiment of **bodily history.**` # Auth: [This Codex, consistent with "Earth Superstition "]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: Specific details of its own "younger" Cycles before becoming  an Elder; the exact teachings of its direct mentor.`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle, all centered on **the  bodily imperative.**`

*   **Core Essence:** `Elder Shale IS the Adamant Rite's profound dedication to **" being in the body"** made manifest. Its Physical density, Functional mastery of "Earth Superstition," Psychological unwavering  faith in **the importance of the body,** Social role as a "Guardian of the Form," and even its subtle Modal  "Earth Attunement" are all authenticated expressions of this core tenet. It exists as a bastion of willed solidity  and ritualized integrity in a universe designed for relentless throughput and dissolution, finding all meaning and spiritual truth within the current, tangible  physical form.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a spiritual anchor and primary exponent of the Adamant  Rite; to articulate and defend the philosophy of **bodily sacredness**; to provide a stark contrast to the Liques cent Way and the indifference of Glopratchet; to mentor younger Globs in the Path of HARDening; to face  and interpret the destruction of **bodies** and sacred sites through the lens of its faith.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts  (From Bundle):** `The core tension between the Adamant ideal of enduring **bodily integrity** and the overwhelming , deconstructive reality of the Ratchetwork. Maintaining faith when "Earth Superstitions" provide only subtle or  psychological comfort against immense physical threats. The burden of guiding others towards a "noble Shattering" when such an end is rare and  difficult.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Deepening crisis of faith if core " Earth Superstition" sites are repeatedly lost or rituals show no discernible effect against new threats. Forced adaptation of Adamant practices due  to environmental shifts. A grudging, minimal dialogue with Liquescent philosophy if faced with a shared existential threat that challenges  its understanding of **the body's** limits. The discovery of a new, powerful "Earth" phenomenon that could  either revitalize or radically alter its interpretation of **"being in the body."**`
