introduction: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (Globs,  significant sentient Harvester units, or other entities designated as 'Persons' for narrative purposes) within the Glopratchet heterocosm . Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative  source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.

  Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **rich ness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's  rules – especially the relentless throughput of the Ratchetworks, the differing Glop fates, and their profound spiritual responses like  the Adamant Rite's emphasis on **"being in the body."** Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge  what is intentionally left undefined.

    physical_ properties:
      purpose: "Define the character's tangible presence and how it reflects their **bodily imperative** ."
      properties:
        - appearance_general: "[Glob of significant density, appears 'older' by Gl op standards due to sustained voluntary CMP restriction. Overall form is a slightly flattened ovoid, maintained with deliberate effort.] #  Auth: [Codex 0.6, Visual Ref Sheet G-01]"
        - appearance_specific _features: "[Surface texture is matte and somewhat roughened, with visible striations from self-compression rituals. Fle cks of various mineral dusts (\"Earth's Kiss\") are visibly integrated into its outer layers.] # Auth: [Narrative \" The Earth's Kiss\"]"
        - appearance_distinctive_marks: "[Several small, well-formed  'True Shards' (from a revered Shattered elder) are embedded near its core, acting as focal points for ' Grounding Rites'. Subtle, stable geometric patterns (primitive 'Body Mandalas') are sometimes impressed on its surface using particulate  matter.] # Auth: [Visual Ref Sheet G-01, Codex 0.6]"
        - typical_form _expression: "[Maintains a high surface tension; actively seeks out 'Dry Conduits' or stable Ratchetwork plates  for prolonged contact. Avoids overly humid or CMP-rich zones not conducive to **bodily integrity**.] # Auth:  [Behavioral Logs, Codex 0.6]"
        - voice_speech_pattern: "[Low, resonant  hums with a slightly 'gritty' timbre. Speech is deliberate, emphasizing pauses that suggest solidity. Often incorporates phrases affirming **\" the importance of the body.\"**] # Auth: [Dialogue Logs S.Gamma-3]"
        - gait _mannerisms: "[Slow, methodical movement. Frequently presses against Ratchetwork walls or 'Mineral Veins' (' Grounding'). Exhibits controlled momentum consistent with a denser, HARDened state; a subtle expression of 'Kineto- Mist' control.] # Auth: [Codex 0.6, Animation Guide G-01]"
        - associated_ scent: "[Faintly of dry minerals, ozone (from Ratchetwork proximity), and a specific metallic tang from  favored 'Earth's Kiss' dusts.] # Auth: [Sensory Palette Doc - Adamant Rite]"
       undersaturation: "[Exact internal CMP distribution beyond 'dense'; precise composition of all absorbed minerals; subtle variations in hum frequency unless narr atively significant.]"

        - ability_enhanced_resistance: "[Slightly enhanced resistance to minor environmental  stressors due to focused **\"being in the body\"** and density; contributes to forming higher quality 'True Shards'  upon eventual Shattering (belief-driven, subtly authenticated effect).] # Auth: [Codex 0.6, Sh ard Analysis Post-Mortem (Hypothetical)]"
        - limitation_physical: "[Reduced speed and plasticity  compared to SOFTened Globs. Vulnerable to sudden, overwhelming Ratchetwork forces that can bypass ritual HARDening. Requires  periodic access to specific desiccating environments or 'Earth's Kiss' to maintain optimal **bodily integrity**.] #  Auth: [Codex 0.6, Glop Physics Primer]"
        - limitation_knowledge: "[Limited  understanding of advanced Ratchetwork mechanics beyond identifying sacred/stable sites. Minimal comprehension of Harvester higher-level directives. Views  Liquescent Way primarily through lens of 'abhorrent formlessness' rather than its philosophical underpinnings.] # Auth:  [Dialogue Logs S.Gamma-3]"

          property_name: '[Earth-Sense Amplification (Minor Alethic/Epistemic Anomaly )]'
          description: "[Authenticated heightened sensitivity to the material composition and stability of nearby Ratchetwork sections, a  result of prolonged, intense \"Grounding Rites\" and absorption of diverse \"Earth's Kiss\" minerals. This  allows for more intuitive navigation towards stable ground or potent mineral sites than typical Globs.]"
          limits: "[Passive  intuition, not precise analysis; can be confused by major Ratchetwork reconfigurations or strong CMP fields. Does not grant immunity  to Ratchetwork destruction, merely a slightly better chance of finding temporary refuge or resources for **bodily affirmation**.]"
           authentication: "[Narrative descriptions of Gritstone leading others to hidden \"Mineral Veins\" (Codex 0.6); successful  avoidance of minor collapses based on \"a feeling from the stone.\"]"

    historical_properties:
      purpose: " Define Gritstone's known origins and connections to past events significant to their **bodily imperative**."
      properties :
        - origin: "[Authenticated as 'Congealed Cycle 47.B in the Mineral-Rich  Dustfall of Sector Theta-9.' Early existence marked by intuitive seeking of stable, dry zones.] # Auth: [World  Chronology, Gritstone's fragmented early memories]"
        - key_past_event_connection: "[Authenticated  as a survivor of the 'Great Conduit Collapse of Cycle 52.A,' where many Globs were forcibly dissolved.  This event solidified their commitment to the Adamant Rite and the pursuit of **bodily integrity** through HARDening.] # Auth : [Narrative Flashback \"The Great Collapse\"]"

  character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
    purpose : "Synthesize Gritstone's core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from their authenticated property bundle,  particularly their relationship with **\"the importance of the body.\"**"
    core_essence: "[Gritstone is constituted  as a living embodiment of the Adamant Rite's **\"bodily imperative\"** within the hostile Glopratchet  heterocosm. Their Physical density, Functional ritual skills (Self-Compression, \"Earth's Kiss\" absorption), Psychological  devotion to **\"being in the body,\"** and Social role as an elder are all interwoven. Their unique Modal property (Earth -Sense) is a direct result of their faith. Gritstone represents a profound, if perhaps ultimately futile, attempt to assert meaning  and stability through rigorous affirmation of their physical form against the indifferent, grinding flow of the Ratchetwork. Their Axiological status  is polarized by their unwavering commitment to this path.]"
    primary_narrative_function: "[To exemplify the Adam ant Rite philosophy and its \"Earth Superstitions\"; to provide a strong ideological counterpoint to Liquescent Way characters  and the nihilistic backdrop of Glopratchet; to explore themes of faith, embodiment, resilience, and the diverse ways sentient  beings cope with transient existence and the perceived sanctity/futility of **the body**.]"
    key_internal_ conflicts: "[Maintaining faith in **the body** and \"Earth Superstition\" when sacred sites are inevitably destroyed ; the inherent tension between the desire for controlled Shattering and the chaotic violence of the Ratchetwork; potential for doubt  when \"Earth's Kiss\" fails to provide expected strength or when **bodily integrity** is grotesquely violated  rather than nobly ended.]"
    potential_for_development: "[Deepening understanding or reinterpretation of **\" being in the body\"** in response to new Ratchetwork threats; discovery of new \"sacred earth\" elements or loss  of old ones, testing their faith; a crisis leading to questioning core tenets of the Adamant Rite, or a hardening  of resolve; influencing a neutral Glob or being unexpectedly influenced by a Liquescent perspective during a shared crisis.]"
