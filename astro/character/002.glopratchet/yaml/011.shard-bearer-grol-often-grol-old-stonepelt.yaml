introduction:
   title: 'Constituting Fictional Persons Textually'
  text: "This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fict ional Persons** (Globs, significant sentient beings) within the **Glopratchet** heterocosm. Following  Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives, Glopratchet World Codex v0.6). They possess **no independent psyche  or reality beyond this textual definition**.\n\nUse this template to systematically build Glop characters by explicitly authenticating their properties  across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle **, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules, particularly the spiritual responses to their  transient forms and the **bodily imperative** of beliefs like the Adamant Rite. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined."

  physical_properties:
     purpose: "Define Grol's tangible presence as an Adamant Rite Glob."
    properties:
       - name: Appearance_General
        value: 'Glob, amorphous but with a pronounced tendency towards a dense, somewhat faceted  resting state. Appears larger than average due to accumulated density, not volume. Texture is rougher, less yielding than un initiated Globs.'

      - name: Appearance_Specific_Features
        value:  'Surface often subtly glitters with embedded mineral dust ("Earth''s Kiss"). Edges appear more defined, less prone to casual  flowing unless deliberately moving. Pseudopods, when extended, are thick and move with deliberation.'
        auth: '[Glop ratchet Codex v0.6: "Earth''s Kiss"]'
      - name: Appearance_Distinctive_Marks
         value: 'Certain areas of Grol''s surface are noticeably compacted or subtly striated – evidence of prolonged self-compression rituals and  contact with Ratchetwork ("Grounding Rites"). May carry a small, particularly lustrous "True Shard" (of  a predecessor) embedded near its core mass.'

      - name: Typical_Attire_Surface _Adornment

      -  name: Voice_Speech_Pattern
        value: "If Globs \"speak\" through vibrations/surface modulations: G rol's \"voice\" is low, resonant, with a slight rasping or crystalline quality. Speech is deliberate, measured, often  invoking phrases about \"bodily truth\" or \"Earth's wisdom.\""

      - name: Gait_Mannerisms
        value: 'Moves with a  slow, ponderous grace, maintaining contact with Ratchetwork surfaces whenever possible. Exhibits controlled momentum. When still, often  presses against stable Ratchetwork sections in a "Grounding Rite." Resists being easily moved by minor Kineto-Mist  currents.'

    purpose: "Define any  inherent unique relationship to Glopratchet's laws, particularly concerning **the body.**"
    properties:
      -  property_id: 'MODAL-GROL-01'
        property_name: 'Ritualistically Enhanced Som atic Integrity (Alethic/Axiological)'
        description: "Grol's dedicated adherence to Adam ant Rite practices (decades of voluntary CMP restriction, absorption of specific mineral dusts from \"Earth's Kiss,\"  ritual self-compression, and \"Grounding Rites\") has resulted in an authenticated, albeit subtle, increase in bodily  density and structural coherence beyond that of an average Glob. This directly influences the quality of Shattering, making \"True Shards\"  more probable, and offers marginally increased resistance to incidental Kineto-Mist displacement or minor environmental stressors. This is an effect of ** \"being in the body\"** as a practiced discipline, not a supernatural power."
        limits: "Does not grant immunity  to significant Ratchetwork operations or direct Harvester actions. The enhancement is relative and subtle, primarily impacting the *nature* of G rol's end rather than preventing it."
        authentication: "Glopratchet Codex v0.6: Core Rule  1 (rituals influence fate); Core Rule 3a (Adamant Rite seeks integrity/density); Core Rule 4 ( KM effects); Core Rule 6 (sacred sites); Alethic Consistency Question on physical effects of \"Earth's Kiss .\" This property authenticates a minor physical ramification of the \"Earth Superstition\" and the \"bodily imperative.\ ""
    note: 'This modal property arises from consistent, long-term engagement with authenticated world rules and ritual systems, not  from an arbitrary unique power.'

  axiological_properties:
    purpose: "Define Grol's value status  *within* Glopratchet, especially concerning **the body.**"
    properties:
      - name:  Reputation_Adamant_Rite_Followers
        value: 'Authenticated as a "True Shard-Bearer," a wise  elder embodying the highest ideals of **bodily integrity** and "Earth Wisdom." His form is seen as a testament.'
         auth: '[Implied from role and Adamant values]'
      - name: Reputation_Liquescent_Way_ Followers
        value: 'Authenticated as "Old Stonepelt," pitiably clinging to transient form, embodying a fearful rejection of  true release. His focus on **the body** is seen as a spiritual trap.'
        auth: '[Glop ratchet Codex v0.6: Axiological - Liquescent views]'
      - name: Reputation_Har vesters
        value: "If processed, Grol's material would be noted as slightly denser, perhaps more  brittle. His beliefs about **the body** are entirely irrelevant data."
        auth: '[Glopratchet Codex  v0.6: Harvester values]'
      - name: Moral_Alignment_Narrative_Framing
         value: "Authenticated via narrative focus as a figure of profound, if perhaps ultimately tragic, dignity; a staunch believer in  the meaning found within one's own physical existence (**the body**) against an indifferent, crushing universe."

     properties:

      - name : Key_Past_Event_Connection
        value: 'Witnessed the "Great Crushing of Sector Gamma-7 ," where many Globs were indiscriminately destroyed, hardening his resolve to achieve a "True Shattering" and preserve **bod ily meaning**. Was present at the consecration of the "Last Standing Pillar" as a sacred Grounding site.'

    undersaturation: "[Specifics of Grol's existence before dedicating to the Adamant Rite; the exact identity of his  mentor.]"

character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
  purpose: "Synthesize Grol's core  identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from his authenticated property bundle, heavily influenced by the **bodily imperative.** "
  core_essence: "Grol is constituted as the embodiment of the Adamant Rite's profound **\"bod ily imperative\"** within Glopratchet. His entire being – physical, functional, psychological – is a testament to the belief  that **the body is sacred** and that meaning is found in its integrity, density, and connection to \"Earth\" elements.  He is a being of deliberate HARDening, ritual devotion, and stoic faith, seeking a \"True Shattering\" as the  ultimate affirmation of his physical existence against the transient, indifferent chaos of the Ratchetwork."
  primary_narrative_ function: "To serve as a primary exponent and living example of the Adamant Rite philosophy; to provide exposition on its rituals , beliefs (\"Earth Superstition,\" **\"being in the body\"**), and values; to act as a mentor or  tragic figure; to showcase the philosophical conflict with the Liquescent Way; and to embody the desperate search for meaning in  a body-centric spirituality within a de-personalizing system."
  key_internal_conflicts_from_bundle:  "The unwavering faith in **the importance of the body** versus the overwhelming, destructive reality of the Ratchetwork.  The drive to preserve and perfect his own form and guide others versus the constant threat of undignified destruction or the \" heresy\" of SOFTening. The potential erosion of faith if \"Earth Superstitions\" prove entirely ineffective against a new  Ratchetwork transformation."
  potential_for_development_based_on_bundle: "Leading a group of  Adamant followers in a defiant last stand at a desecrated sacred site. Achieving a uniquely \"perfect\" or unexpectedly significant Shat tering. A crisis of faith if a core \"Earth Superstition\" (e.g., a specific mineral)  is proven inert or even detrimental by a Ratchetwork event. Grappling with a grotesque physical transformation that violates his ideal  of **bodily integrity** but doesn't lead to Shattering."
