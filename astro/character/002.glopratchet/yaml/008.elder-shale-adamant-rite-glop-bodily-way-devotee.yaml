introduction:  |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the  Glopratchet heterocosm. Following Dole≈æel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties  authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.

  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on  creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

          Description: "Authenticated through consistent success, Elder Shale possesses a slightly enhanced ability to  sense subtle variations in Ratchetwork material composition or structural stability. This aids in locating new sources of beneficial \"Mineral Dust s\" or stable \"Grounding Plates\" crucial for \"being in the body.\" Not a magical sense, but a  highly developed experiential understanding interpreted as a spiritual gift."
          Limits: "Short-range, intuitive, requires focused ritual  state (\"Grounding\"). Cannot predict large-scale Ratchetwork shifts, only assess immediate local conditions. Can be misleading if  Ratchetwork composition is novel."
          Authentication: "Narrative demonstration of finding resources; Glopratchet Co herence Protocol Consistency Check Question (Alethic): \"Do the 'Grounding Rites' ... have any authenticated,  albeit minor, physical effect...?\" - this leans towards psychological reinforcement but allows for subtle, experientially derived sensitivities."

        auth:  "[Glopratchet Coherence Protocol - Liquescent Values]"
      Reputation_Neutral_Globs:
         description: "May be viewed with awe for its conviction, or as an extreme example of a difficult path; its unwavering focus on ** the body** can be intimidating."
        auth: "[This Codex]"
      Moral_Alignment_Narrative_ Framing:
        description: "Authenticated via narrative focus as embodying a profound, if arguably futile, spiritual discipline centered on ** bodily integrity** and finding meaning in form against an indifferent, form-destroying universe."
        auth: "[This Codex , reflecting Glopratchet themes]"
      undersaturation: "How Harvesters specifically perceive its density (likely just \" high-quality solid material\" if it Shatters well)."

      Origin:

        description: "Authenticated as a survivor of  \"The Great Crushing of Sector Tau-7,\" where a major Adamant Rite sacred site (\"The Pillar of Un yielding Form\") was obliterated. This event intensified its dedication to preserving **the body's** dignity and Adamant principles."

      Inherited_Items_Integrated:

  character_constitution_summary_and_narrative _function:
    purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated  property bundle, all centered on **the bodily imperative.**"
    Core_Essence: |
      Elder Shale IS the Adam ant Rite's profound dedication to **"being in the body"** made manifest. Its Physical density, Functional mastery of " Earth Superstition," Psychological unwavering faith in **the importance of the body,** Social role as a "Guardian of the Form ," and even its subtle Modal "Earth Attunement" are all authenticated expressions of this core tenet. It exists as a bastion  of willed solidity and ritualized integrity in a universe designed for relentless throughput and dissolution, finding all meaning and spiritual truth within the  current, tangible physical form.
    Primary_Narrative_Function: |
      To serve as a spiritual anchor and primary  exponent of the Adamant Rite; to articulate and defend the philosophy of **bodily sacredness**; to provide a  stark contrast to the Liquescent Way and the indifference of Glopratchet; to mentor younger Globs in the Path  of HARDening; to face and interpret the destruction of **bodies** and sacred sites through the lens of its faith. 
    Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: |
      The core tension between the Adamant ideal of  enduring **bodily integrity** and the overwhelming, deconstructive reality of the Ratchetwork. Maintaining faith when " Earth Superstitions" provide only subtle or psychological comfort against immense physical threats. The burden of guiding others towards a "noble Shat tering" when such an end is rare and difficult.
    Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle : |
      Deepening crisis of faith if core "Earth Superstition" sites are repeatedly lost or rituals show  no discernible effect against new threats. Forced adaptation of Adamant practices due to environmental shifts. A grudging, minimal dialogue with L iquescent philosophy if faced with a shared existential threat that challenges its understanding of **the body's** limits. The discovery of a  new, powerful "Earth" phenomenon that could either revitalize or radically alter its interpretation of **"being in the body." **
