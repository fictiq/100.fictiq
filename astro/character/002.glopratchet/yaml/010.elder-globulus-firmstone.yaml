            crystalline patina.]

    core_essence: >
      Elder Globulus Firmstone is constituted as the embodiment of  the Adamant Rite's
      desperate, dignified assertion of meaning in Glopratchet. Its entire being  –
      from its dense Physical form flecked with sacred minerals, to its Functional
      mastery of "HARD ening" rituals, to its Psychological devotion to "the importance
      of the body" – is a testament to this path . Firmstone's Social role as an Elder
      and its Axiological status among its followers are direct consequences of this
       profound commitment. Its primary internal conflict stems from upholding this
      faith in "bodily integrity" against the relentless,  de-personalizing "Grinding
      Flow" of the Ratchetwork.
