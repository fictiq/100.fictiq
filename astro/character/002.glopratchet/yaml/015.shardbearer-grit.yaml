introduction: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant  sentient beings) within the **Glopratchet** heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE ** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives).  They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.

  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly  authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence,  and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules  – particularly the relentless throughput, diverse Glop fates, and the Globs' profound, often desperate, spiritual responses centered on the very  nature of their existence and their transient forms, such as **the Bodily Imperative of the Adamant Rite**.*  *Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

character_constitution_summary_and_narrative_function:
  purpose: "Synt hesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
  core_essence:  |
    [Shardbearer Grit is constituted as the living embodiment of the Adamant Rite's "Bodily Imperative " within Glopratchet. Their entire being – from their dense, mineral-infused Physical form to their Stoic Psychological state  and Functional dedication to ritual HARDening – is an authenticated manifestation of the belief that **the body is sacred** and that meaning is  found in affirming its integrity against an indifferent, grinding cosmos. Grit *is* their faith; their properties are the tenets of the Adam ant Rite made tangible. Their existence is a constant performance of "being in the body" and venerating "Earth Super stition."]
  primary_narrative_function: |
    [To serve as a primary exemplar and teacher of  the Adamant Rite philosophy; to provide a profound spiritual and physical counterpoint to the Liquescent Way and the general despair of  Glopratchet; to explore themes of resilience, faith, the nature of embodiment, and the search for meaning in a hostile,  mechanical universe. Grit's actions and fate directly test the coherence and limits of the Adamant Rite's worldview.] 
  key_internal_conflicts: |
    [The drive to maintain **bodily integrity** vs. the overwhelming  destructive power of the Ratchetwork; the desire to guide others to "True Shattering" vs. the frequent, chaotic, " un-noble" ends of most Globs; the unwavering belief in **the importance of the body** vs. potential  (unacknowledged) despair at the seeming futility of this stance against an indifferent system; the tension between self-pres ervation through HARDening and the ultimate goal of a "noble" Shattering.]
  potential_for_development: |
     [How Grit responds to the destruction of a major sacred "Grounding Plate" (Historical/Psychological impact); encountering  a Glob whose Dissolution appears genuinely transcendent (Epistemic/Psychological challenge); facing a Ratchetwork transformation that forces a  choice between maintaining form and a less "noble" survival (Functional/Axiological crisis); the quality and impact of their own eventual  Shattering (Physical/Axiological culmination).]
