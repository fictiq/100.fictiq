introduction_title: "Con stituting Fictional Persons Textually"
introduction_body: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **F ictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the **Glopratchet** heterocosm. Following  Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives, Glopratchet Coherence Protocol). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond  this textual definition**.

  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on  creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules – especially the Globs' profound responses to their existence  through paths like the Adamant Rite. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.
