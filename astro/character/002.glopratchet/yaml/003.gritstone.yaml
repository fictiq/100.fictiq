introduction: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (primarily  Globs, but also significant Harvesters or other sentient constructs) within the Glopratchet heterocosm. Following  Dole≈æel's framework, these entities **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives, Glopratchet Internal Coherence Protocol v0.6). They possess **no  independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition.** This is especially crucial for understanding Globs, whose entire existence is a testament to their  transient forms and their profound, often desperate, spiritual responses to the grinding flow.

  Use this template to systematically build Gl opratchet entities by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the ** richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, particularly regarding their relationship to their own bodies, CMP, the  Ratchetwork, and their chosen spiritual path (Adamant Rite, Liquescent Way, or other). Remember ** undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined, especially concerning the unfathomable 'inner lives' beyond authenticated  belief systems and reactions.

  Core_Essence:
    value: "[Summarize the character based on the interplay of  their key authenticated properties, emphasizing their relationship with Glopratchet's core mechanics and philosophies. e.g.,  Gritstone is constituted as an embodiment of the Adamant Rite's 'Bodily Imperative.' His Physical density and adorn ment with 'Earth\\'s Kiss,' Functional ritual skills, Psychological reverence for **his body**, and Social role as an ' Earth Keeper' are all interwoven. His existence is a defiant affirmation of physical form against the Ratchetwork's grinding  indifference. His Axiological worth is defined by his Path, while the Ratchetwork deems him mere material. His Historical connection to ' The Motherlode' grounds his 'Earth Superstition.']"
