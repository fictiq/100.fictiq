introduction: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of Fictional  Persons (primarily Globs, but potentially Harvesters or other sentient entities if narratively significant) within the Gloprat chet heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters ARE constituted by the bundle of properties authenticated for them by the authoritative  narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition. This protocol is  specifically tailored to the realities of Glopratchet, including the amorphous nature of Globs, their varying CMP states, their profound  spiritual responses (The Adamant Rite's "Bodily Imperative" and The Liquescent Way's " Spirit Flow"), and their existence within the indifferent, grinding Ratchetworks.

  Use this template to systematically build Glob  characters by explicitly authenticating their properties. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their  authenticated bundle, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature, their chosen (or unchosen) spiritual path, and  Glopratchet's unforgiving rules. Remember undersaturation: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined regarding  their amorphous forms or fragmented histories.

      [Summar ize the Glob based on the interplay of their key authenticated properties. e.g., Gritstone is constituted as an embodiment of the  Adamant Rite's "Bodily Imperative." His Physical density and "Earth's Kiss"-dusted form are tangible  manifestations of his Psychological commitment to "being in the body." His Functional resilience (minor resistance to dispersal) is an authenticated outcome of his  rituals, while his limitations (slow movement) are accepted facets of his path. His Social role as an "Earth Keeper" reinforces  his beliefs and dictates his interactions. He represents the struggle to find meaning and preserve identity through bodily integrity against the overwhelming, de -personalizing forces of Glopratchet.]
    primary_narrative_function: '[e.g.,  Protagonist embodying the Adamant Rite''s philosophy; Antagonist representing the Liquescent Way''s opposing view; Mentor  figure passing on "Earth Superstitions"; Foil to a Glob struggling with their faith/form; Victim highlighting the brutality  of the Ratchetwork.]'
    key_internal_conflicts_from_bundle_and_path: '[e .g., Adamant: Upholding "Bodily Integrity" vs. overwhelming destructive force of Ratchetwork; Faith  in "Earth Superstition" vs. apparent futility. Liquescent: Innate survival instinct vs. desire for Diss olution; Patience for achieving "perfect flow" vs. immediate threats. General: Hope vs. Despair in the face of  the Grinding Flow.]'
    potential_for_development_based_on_bundle_and_glop ratchet_dynamics: '[e.g., Deepening of faith (Psychological) or crisis of faith due to Ratchetwork  events; Acquisition of new ritual knowledge (Functional/Historical); Shift in spiritual path (Psychological/Social change); Physical  alteration due to extreme environmental pressure or partial/failed ritual outcome (Physical/Functional change).]'
