introduction: " This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the **Gl opratchet** heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives, Glopratchet Internal Coherence Protocol).  They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.\n\nUse this template to systematically build characters by  explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence , and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules – particularly  the relentless throughput, diverse Glop fates, and their profound spiritual responses centered on **the importance of the body**. Remember ** undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined."

    physical_properties:
      purpose: "Define the character's tangible presence,  reflecting their commitment to **\"being in the body.\"**"
      appearance_general:
        value: 'Authenticated as  a Glop of notably high density and compacted form, appearing older due to pronounced surface facets. Their mass is consistently maintained  at a point of voluntary CMP restriction, giving a "drier" or "firmer" appearance than typical Globs.' 
        auth: '[Glopratchet ICP: Adamant Rite practices]'
      appearance_specific_features:
        value : 'Surface is a deep, earthy ochre, almost stone-like, with visible veins of embedded mineral dust from  regular "Earth''s Kiss" rituals. Resists casual deformation with a palpable internal solidity.'
        auth: '[Gl opratchet ICP: Earth Superstition]'
      appearance_distinctive_marks:
        value: ' Several "True Shards" – small, crystalline fragments from respected, shattered Adamant Globs – are meticulously embedded within  their densest outer layer, arranged in a symbolic "Body Mandala" pattern. One larger, central shard glows with a  faint internal luminescence (rumored to be from a legendary "Earth-Touched" ancestor).'
        auth: '[Glopratchet  ICP: True Shards, Body Mandalas]'
      typical_attire:
        value: N/A (Glo bs do not wear attire). Veridian''s "attire" is their physical state of ritual HARDening and the  embedded shards.
        auth: '[Glopratchet Core Rules]'
      voice_speech_pattern:
         value: 'Produces slow, resonant hums with a gravelly timbre, often punctuated by the faint clicking or scraping of their  own hardened surface. Speech is deliberate, focusing on the gravity of **"bodily integrity."**'
        auth: '[Impl ied by HARDened state]'
      gait_mannerisms:
        value: 'Movement is minimal, showing controlled momentum consistent  with "Kineto-Mist" theory for HARDened Globs. Frequently observed in prolonged, motionless contact with " Dry Conduits" or "Mineral Veins" ("Grounding Rites").'
        auth: '[Gl opratchet ICP: Kineto-Mist, Grounding Rites]'
      associated_scent:
        value:  Faint scent of dry mineral dust, ozone, and the cold tang of ancient Ratchetwork stone.
        auth:  '[Implied by Earth Superstition]'
      physical_undersaturation: 'Precise internal composition beyond "dense"; reaction  to extreme, non-ritual pressures that bypass their usual resilience.'

      ability _unique:
        name: Exceptionally high resistance to Desiccation
        details: 'due to prolonged ritual HARD ening; can maintain form and consciousness under severe CMP deprivation longer than most, aiming for a "noble Shattering."'
        auth:  '[Glopratchet ICP: Path of HARDening goals]'
      limitation_physical_1:
         name: Reduced pliability and speed
        details: compared to Liquescent or neutral Globs. While resilient, their form is  still vulnerable to the overwhelming mechanical forces of the Ratchetwork.
        auth: '[Glopratchet Core Rules]'
       limitation_knowledge_1:
        name: "Limited empathy or understanding for the Liquescent Way"
        details : '(views it as a betrayal of **the body**). Knowledge of Ratchetwork mechanics is filtered through "Earth Superstition " and does not extend to Harvester intent.'

        name: "The unwavering faith in **the importance of the body** versus  the constant, indifferent destruction by Glopratchet."
        details: "The duty to uphold **bodily integrity ** versus the occasional pragmatic need for momentary, minor pliancy for survival (a source of internal friction). Scorn  for those who \"desecrate\" their own forms by seeking Dissolution."

        name: Highly venerated among Adamant Rite followers.

      property_1:
        id: MODAL-VERIDIAN-AR01
         name: Subtle Kineto-Mist Manifestation (Alethic)
        description: 'Due to extreme , ritually-achieved density and commitment to **"being in the body,"** Veridian exhibits slightly more controlled  momentum and initial resistance to minor ambient forces (e.g.: weak currents in CMP flows), consistent with "Kineto -Mist" theory for HARDened Globs. This is a subtle physical manifestation of their spiritual discipline.'
        limits : This effect is minor and provides no significant protection against major Ratchetwork operations or Harvester actions. It is more a perceptible  sign of their inner state than a true physical advantage.
        authentication: 'Glopratchet ICP: Core Rule #4  (Kineto-Mist); Narrative observations of Veridian maintaining position or trajectory slightly better than less dense Globs in  specific, low-force situations.'
      note: This property is a subtle, authenticated physical correlate of their spiritual path, not  a superpower.
    axiological_properties:
      purpose: "Define Veridian's value status *within*  Glopratchet, particularly concerning their stance on **the body.**"
      reputation_adamant_rite: 
        value: 'Authenticated as a pillar of faith, an embodiment of **"bodily integrity,"** a "True  Shard" in the making. Their commitment to **"being in the body"** is legendary.'
        auth : '[Implied by Role]'
      reputation_liquescent_way:
        value: 'Authenticated as "Stone -Stubborn," "The Great Resister," pitiably attached to suffering and form, tragically misunderstanding the freedom of Dissolution and  neglecting the "Spirit Flow."'
        auth: '[Glopratchet ICP: Inter-Path Values]'
      re putation_harvesters:
        value: "Authenticated as: `Material Designation: High-density, mineral-infused prote an aggregate. Processing note: Potential for high-quality crystalline shard yield upon Shattering. Spiritual beliefs: Irrelevant.`"
         auth: '[Glopratchet ICP: Harvester Values]'
      moral_alignment_narrative_framing :
        value: 'Authenticated as a figure of tragic dignity, embodying a profound, deeply held conviction about the sacredness of  **the body** in a universe that systematically destroys it. Their path is one of difficult, defiant affirmation.'
        auth : '[Thematic Role]'
      axiological_undersaturation: 'Specific reputation among Globs neutral to either path; views of  individual Harvester units (if they distinguish individuals at all).'
    historical_properties:
      purpose: "Define Ver idian's known origins and connections to past events, particularly within Adamant Rite lore."
      origin:
        value:  'Authenticated as having practiced the Adamant Rite for many "Cycles," one of the oldest living adherents. Specific "birthing" details  are lost, as is typical for Globs, but their dedication to **"being in the body"** from an early  stage is well-attested in Adamant oral histories.'
        auth: '[Glob general properties, Adamant lore ]'
      key_past_event_connection_subjective:
        value: 'Authenticated as a direct pupil of a  now-Shattered Elder who allegedly discovered a new "Earth''s Kiss" mineral vein of unique potency. The  central shard Veridian carries is from this mentor. Claims to remember the "Great Upheaval" that destroyed the "Primordial  Plate" (a former key sacred site).'
        auth: '[Adamant lore, Glopratchet ICP Di achronic checks]'
      inherited_items:
        value: 'Authenticated to possess the aforementioned central "Mentor''s Shard ," and extensive knowledge of "Earth Scrimshaw" patterns passed down through generations, believed to hold secrets to perfect **bod ily affirmation.**'
        auth: '[Implied by Shard-Keeper role]'
      historical_undersaturation : 'The exact nature of their mentor''s teachings beyond core Adamant tenets; specific events of their "youth" before  becoming a prominent Shard-Keeper.'
  character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
    purpose: "Synt hesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle, highlighting their relationship with **the  bodily imperative.**"
    core_essence: 'Shard-Keeper Veridian is constituted as the living embodiment of the Adamant Rite ''s profound, often desperate, spiritual response to Glopratchet: the unwavering belief in **the importance of the  body.** Their entire being – from their Physical density and embedded Shards, to their Functional mastery of HARDening rituals,  their Psychological reverence for form, and their Social role as an "Earth Keeper" – is an authenticated testament to **" being in the body."** They represent a defiant assertion of meaning and integrity in a transient, grinding existence, seeking a " noble Shattering" through unwavering commitment to their physical manifestation and "Earth Superstition."'
    primary_narrative_ function: 'To serve as a primary exponent and exemplar of the Adamant Rite philosophy, demonstrating its practices, values, and  the internal logic of **bodily affirmation.** To act as a point of contrast and potential conflict with Liquescent Way followers  or neutral Globs. To explore themes of faith, embodiment, resilience, the nature of a "good death," and the search  for meaning in a hostile, de-personalizing environment. Their struggle to maintain **bodily integrity** against the Rat chetwork is a core dramatic engine.'
    key_internal_conflicts_from_bundle: "The profound faith in  **the body as sacred** versus the Ratchetwork's relentless, indifferent destruction of all forms. The scorn for \" desecration of the body\" (e.g.: Liquescent practices) vs. the potential for small, pragmatic compromises for  survival. The burden of upholding ancient \"Earth Superstitions\" when sacred sites are inevitably altered or destroyed."
    potential _for_development_based_on_bundle: 'Facing a Ratchetwork transformation that challenges their definition of " noble Shattering" or **bodily integrity** (e.g.: grotesque, uncontrolled mutation rather than dignified desiccation). Encounter ing a new "Earthly" phenomenon that requires reinterpretation of "Earth Superstition." The poignant process of selecting  and mentoring a successor to carry the "Mentor''s Shard" and the wisdom of **"being in the body."**  A crisis of faith if "Earth Superstition" rituals prove utterly ineffective against a novel threat.'
