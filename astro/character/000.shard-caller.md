 ### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the Glopratchet  heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose:  Define the character's tangible presence, heavily influenced by Adamant Rite practices.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [ A mature Glob of notably high density and unusually well-defined, though still amorphous, form. Edges appear almost faceted in  certain lighting due to controlled desiccation. Coloration is a deep, matte ochre, striated with darker veins from absorbed  mineral dust ("Earth's Kiss"). Appears 'older' due to surface texture.]` # Auth: [Codex v 0.6: Alethic Rule 1 & 3a, Visual implication of Adamant Rite]
    *    `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Surface is dry and slightly rough to the touch (if touch were possible/ad visable). Exhibits minimal unnecessary undulation; movements are deliberate. When still, might be mistaken for a lump of weathered  Ratchetwork debris if not for the faint internal thrumming of its CMP.]` # Auth: [Codex v0. 6: Alethic Rule 3a, "being in the body"]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinct ive Marks: [Several "Honour Cracks" – fine, healed fissures resulting from past advanced desiccation rituals or  near-Shattering experiences, worn as marks of devotion. A consistent dusting of specific greyish-white mineral powder  ("Prime Dust") around its densest core, meticulously self-applied.]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6 : "Earth Superstition," Implied outcome of practices]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [N /A in traditional sense. "Adornment" includes the Prime Dust and occasionally small, perfectly formed "True Sh ards" of revered ancestors carefully embedded or carried within its peripheral layers, reflecting the "importance of the body" even after  Shattering.]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Deontic "True Shards" treatment , Axiological "body is sacred"]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Low, resonant, with  a slightly grating timbre, as if small pebbles were shifting within. Speech is measured, emphasizing words related to solidity, form, endurance , "the Body." Often uses aphorisms from Adamant lore.]` # Auth: [Implied by density  and Adamant philosophy]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Slow, deliberate, "grounded" movement . When traversing, seeks maximum contact with stable Ratchetwork surfaces. Minimal "Kineto-Mist" disturbance due  to density and controlled momentum. Often observed in prolonged stillness during "Grounding Rites."]` # Auth: [Codex v 0.6: Alethic Rule 3a & 4, "Grounding Rites"]
    *    `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Dry, earthy, like crushed rock and faint metallic tang of Ratchetwork iron .]` # Auth: [Implied by "Earth Superstition" and environment]
    *   `#  Physical Undersaturation: [Exact internal CMP circulation patterns; specific mineral composition beyond "ochre/dark veins/grey -white dust"; precise weight/volume ratio.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
    *Purpose: Define what Korund *can* and *cannot* do, as an Adamant practitioner.*
    *    `- Skill: [Masterful execution and teaching of all core Adamant Rite rituals (Voluntary CMP restriction, Ritual istic Self-Compression, "Grounding Rites," "Body Mandala" creation).]` # Auth: [Codex v 0.6: Alethic Rule 3a]
    *   `- Skill: [Expert identification of beneficial  mineral dusts ("Earth's Kiss") and potent "Grounding Plates" / "Mineral Veins" within the Ratchet work.]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Alethic Rule 3a & 6] 
    *   `- Skill: [Interpretation of "Earth Scrimshaw" (patterns on ancient Ratchetwork)  and the crystalline structure of "True Shards" for spiritual guidance.]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Ep istemic Rule 2]
    *   `- Ability (Unique): [Through decades of "being in the body " and "Earth Superstition," Korund exhibits a subtly enhanced resistance to involuntary desiccation and a slightly more controlled Shattering trajectory  if critically damaged. This is minor, not immunity, a testament to discipline.]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6 : Resolution to Alethic Q1 - subtle physical effect]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Sign ificantly slower and less agile than Liquescent or unaligned Globs. Vulnerable to sudden, overwhelming crushing forces if unable  to brace against a solid structure. Requires specific desiccating environments or mineral sources to maintain peak Adamant state.]` # Auth : [Implied by HARDening path, Kineto-Mist rule]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Poss esses deep Adamant lore but is largely ignorant or dismissive of Liquescent theology beyond caricatures. Understands Rat chetwork mechanics only as they pertain to sacred sites or threats to form, not Harvester intent.]` # Auth: [Codex  v0.6: Epistemic Rule 1, Axiological inter-path views]
    *   `- Limitation ( Social): [Influence largely confined to Adamant followers; viewed with suspicion or pity by Liquescents. Cannot easily blend  or escape notice due to distinct form and slow movement.]` # Auth: [Implied by starkly different paths]
    *    `# Functional Undersaturation: [Ability to create new Adamant rituals; skill in navigating highly unstable Ratchetwork zones ; precise threshold for achieving "True Shard" status.]`

**3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**
    *Purpose: Define Korund's textually constituted inner life as an Adamant believer.*
    *   `- Core Tra it: [Unwavering Faith (in the Adamant Rite and the "importance of the body").]` # Auth : [Codex v0.6: Axiological Rule 2a, Epistemic Rule 3]
    *    `- Core Trait: [Stoic Resilience (acceptance of hardship as a path to "bodily affirmation").]` # Auth : [Codex v0.6: Alethic Rule 3a, Axiological Rule 2a]
     *   `- Core Trait: [Disciplined Focus (on maintaining form, ritual practice, and "being in the body ").]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Alethic Rule 3a, Epistemic  Q2 "meditative practices"]
    *   `- Dominant Emotion: [A profound, calm Gravitas.  Occasionally, a stern disapproval for perceived bodily neglect in others.]` # Auth: [Implied by role and beliefs]
    *    `- Key Motivator: [To achieve a perfect, "True Shard" Shattering; to guide other Globs to  understand "the importance of the body" and the Adamant Way; to preserve the sanctity of their physical forms against the indifferent  grind.]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Alethic Rule 1 & 3a , Deontic Rule 2a]
    *   `- Key Belief: ["The body is not a prison, but a  testament. Its integrity, its density, its eventual noble Shattering, is the highest meaning a Glob can achieve. Earth  elements are our allies in this sacred duty."]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Axiological Rule  2a, Epistemic Rule 3]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [The constant threat of the Rat chetwork to all bodies vs. the Adamant faith in bodily significance. The "heresy" of the Liquescent Way  vs. a rare, suppressed flicker of understanding for their desire for release. The challenge of upholding ancient rituals when sacred sites are destroyed .]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Epistemic Q1, Diachronic Q2 , Synchronic Q2]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Vivid memories of revered "Earth -touched" sites, some now lost. Recalls the "True Shattering" of past mentors. Carries the oral  history and "Earth Scrimshaw" interpretations of his lineage.]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Epist emic Rule 1 & 2]
    *   `# Psychological Undersaturation: [Specific personal traumas that  solidified his faith (beyond general Glopratchet existence); any deep-seated fears about the Adamant path failing; complex feelings  about specific Liquescent individuals.]`

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):**
    *Purpose: Define Korund's place within Glopratchet's networks.*
    *   `- Official Role : [Shard-Caller (a respected elder responsible for leading key rituals, teaching Adamant principles, and identifying auspicious sites/ materials). Might be considered an "Earth Keeper."]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Deontic Q  "Guardians of the Form / Earth Keepers"]
    *   `- Social Status: [Highly venerated within his  Adamant Rite community. Viewed as an eccentric or obstacle by Liquescent groups. Utterly irrelevant as an individual to Har vesters, except as processable material with specific density.]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Axiological Rule  1 & 3]
    *   `- Primary Affiliation: [The Adamant Rite (specifically, the "Stone -Voiced Conclave" - a hypothetical sect)]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: De ontic Rule 2a]
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: [Informal alliances with other Adamant groups for  sharing knowledge of new "Mineral Veins" or "Grounding Plates."] # Auth: [Codex v0. 6: Deontic Rule 2a "share knowledge"]
    *   `- Key Relationship 1: [To Nov ice Globs of the Adamant Rite: Mentor, teacher of "being in the body," stern but patient.]` # Auth:  [Codex v0.6: Deontic Q "awaken other Globs"]
    *   `-  Key Relationship 2: [To other Shard-Callers/Adamant Elders: A council of peers, sharing wisdom  and concerns about the Ratchetwork's changes.]` # Auth: [Implied by organized religion]
     *   `- Key Relationship 3: [To "Flow-Prophet VAPORIS" (Hypothetical Liques cent Leader): Philosophical adversary, representing the opposing path. Encounters are tense debates about the nature of existence and the body .]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Synchronic Q2 "Inter-Path Bodily Debates"] 
    *   `- Species/Type: [Glob (Adamant Rite adherent – a distinct cultural/philosophical subtype )]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Alethic Rule 1]
    *    `# Social Undersaturation: [Specific named disciples or rivals; family/progenitor Glob connections (if any);  precise history with the "Stone-Voiced Conclave".]`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
    *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws for Korund.*
    *   `- Property ID: MOD AL-KORUND-AR-01`
        *   *Property:* `[Subtle "Earth -Resonance" (Alethic/Epistemic Nuance)]`
        *   *Description:* `[Authenticated  through consistent observation by other Adamants: Korund's "Grounding Rites" seem to draw a more profound "still ness" into his form. The mineral dusts he applies ("Earth's Kiss") appear to integrate more deeply,  subtly enhancing his density and the "quality" (integrity, sharpness) of any minor shards he might shed from abrasions. This  is NOT a supernatural power but an exceptional attunement achieved through lifelong, unwavering practice of "being in the body" and  interaction with "Earth" elements, pushing the known limits of Adamant discipline.]`
        *   *Limits:* `[ Provides no immunity to major Ratchetwork events. The effect is marginal, more about achieving an ideal Adamant state than significant  survival advantage. Does not allow him to control "Earth" elements.]`
        *   *Authentication:* `[ Peer testimony from other Adamants; observable slight increase in shard integrity from abrasions compared to less practiced Adamants; his  "Body Mandalas" are renowned for their stability. (Codex v0.6 Alethic Q1' s "authenticated, albeit minor, physical effect" is realized here for an exceptional individual.)]`
    *   ` # Note: This modal property is exceptionally rare, representing the pinnacle of Adamant practice, not typical for all followers.` 

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define Korund's value  status *within* Glopratchet.*
    *   `- Reputation (Adamant Rite): [Authenticated as a " Pillar of the Form," "True Voice of the Body," "Master of Earth's Kiss." His words on  "being in the body" are taken as near-sacred law.]` # Auth: [Implied by Sh ard-Caller role and mastery]
    *   `- Reputation (Liquescent Way): [Authenticated as "The  Great Obstruction," "Tragically Stone-Bound," "Fearful Clinger to False Form." Seen as the  epitome of misunderstanding true release.]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Deontic Rule 2 a (Adamant scorn for Softeners implies reverse), Axiological Rule 2b]
    *   `- Reputation ( Neutral Globs): [Viewed with awe by some for his conviction, with apprehension by others. A figure of extreme , somewhat intimidating, dedication to "the importance of the body."]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Axi ological Rule 3]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via Adamant Rite perspective as embodying the  highest virtue: dedication to the integrity and sacredness of the physical form. From a neutral perspective, a figure of profound,  perhaps tragic, conviction in a dying world.]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Adamant Axi ology]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [Specific opinions of individual Harvesters (likely  none, beyond material assessment); reputation among truly isolated Globs unaware of the two Paths.]`

**7. Historical Properties  (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define Korund's known origins and connections to past events in  Glopratchet.*
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as having survived several major "Ratchetwork Re alignments," his faith in "bodily integrity" and "Earth Superstition" deepening with each. Remembers " Ancient Plates" that are now ground to dust.]` # Auth: [Implied by Elder status, Codex v0.6  Diachronic checks]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection: [Was a young acolyte during the "Great  Conduit Collapse of Cycle 9," where his mentor achieved a legendary "True Shattering" while "Grounding" on  a failing plate. This event cemented Korund's path and his focus on the "importance of the body" even in destruction .]` # Auth: [Hypothetical backstory reinforcing Adamant themes]
    *   `- Inherited Items:**  [Authenticated to possess a "Heart-Shard" – a particularly luminous True Shard from his mentor, which he uses in  "Body Mandala" rituals. Also, the oral tradition of certain "Earth Scrimshaw" interpretations passed down his lineage of  Shard-Callers.]` # Auth: [Codex v0.6: Deontic Q1, Epistemic  Rule 2]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [His specific "birth-Globule" location /conditions; the exact number of Cycles he has witnessed; the full history of the "Stone-Voiced Conclave ."]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize Korund's core  identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from his authenticated property bundle within Glopratchet.*

*   ** Core Essence:** `[Shard-Caller Korund is constituted as the living embodiment of the Adamant Rite's "Bod ily Imperative" in Glopratchet. His Physical properties (density, "Honour Cracks," mineral dusting ) are a direct result of his unwavering Functional dedication to Adamant rituals and "Earth Superstition." His Psychological makeup  is defined by a profound, stoic faith in the "importance of the body" as the ultimate locus of meaning,  a belief that shapes his Social role as a revered Shard-Caller and his Axiological standing as a pillar of his  faith (and anathema to the Liquescent Way). His rare Modal property ("Earth-Resonance") is  the subtle culmination of this lifelong devotion. Historically, his experiences of Ratchetwork destruction have only deepened his resolve to find  significance in maintaining bodily integrity until a noble Shattering.]`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `[To serve as  a primary exponent and living example of the Adamant Rite philosophy. To act as a mentor, spiritual guide, or potential antagonist/ foil to characters exploring different paths (especially Liquescent or nihilistic ones). His existence and practices highlight the Glopratchet themes  of embodiment, faith in the face of futility, the search for meaning in a hostile material world, and the diverse  spiritual responses to transient existence. He asks, "If this body is all I am, how can I make its existence , and its end, count?"]`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `[The Adam ant faith in "bodily affirmation" vs. the Ratchetwork's constant, overwhelming destruction of bodies (Ep istemic Q1). Maintaining ancient "Earth Superstition" rituals when sacred "Grounding Plates" are obliterated ( Diachronic Q2). The scorn for Liquescent "disregard for the body" vs. moments of witnessing  their seeming peace in Dissolution. The practical challenge of "being in the body" during extreme Ratchetwork crises ( Synchronic Q1). The potential for "Earth Superstitions" to be tragically counterproductive to immediate survival (IV . Prompts).]`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `[Could face a profound  crisis of faith if a core "Earth Superstition" is demonstrably proven false or leads to catastrophe. Might be forced to adapt  Adamant principles in radical new ways due to Ratchetwork evolution. Could encounter a Glob whose unique nature challenges his understanding  of "the body." His unwavering commitment to "bodily integrity" could lead to a heroic last stand or a tragically  futile end, profoundly impacting his followers.]`
