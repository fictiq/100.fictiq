  CharacterConstitutionSummary:
    CoreEssence:  'Wade "Gatorbait" Johnson is constituted as a man systematically broken by the brutal socio-economic realities of  Primal Mama, specifically the unchecked power of the Meat Oligarchy. His identity is forged in loss, injustice, and  the corrosive effects of fear and resentment. His physical and psychological scars are direct authentications of his victimhood. His belief  in the "invisible women" conspiracy is a desperate attempt to make sense of a world where mundane greed inflicts catastrophic suffering , showcasing the epistemic fragility of the oppressed.'
    PrimaryNarrativeFunction: "To embody the human cost of the Olig archy's dominance in Lickskillet; to serve as a potent example of the 'friction' they cause for mom -and-pop operations; a potential (if reluctant or damaged) source of information or catalyst for action for protagonists opposing the status quo ; to illustrate the spread and psychological appeal of conspiracy theories among the dispossessed."
    KeyInternalConflicts:
      - ' Desire for revenge vs. crippling fear of the oligarchy'
      - 'Pride in his past skills vs.  shame of his current state'
      - 'Trusting anyone vs. deep-seated paranoia'
    PotentialForDevelopment: ' Could be pushed to a desperate act of rebellion (Social/Functional change); Could find a new, albeit grim, purpose in exposing the  Oligarchy (Psychological/Social change); Could succumb entirely to paranoia and conspiracy (Psychological change); Could be "rescued " or offered a path to small vengeance by more powerful actors (e.g.: Erpenthropes, protagonists ), altering his Social and Functional properties.'
