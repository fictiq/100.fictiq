character_constitution_summary:
  core _essence: >-
    Gatorbait Gus is constituted as an embodiment of the resilient, struggling working class of Primal Mama 's Lickskillet.
    His existence is defined by the GE Alligator economy, the constraints of the  1970s tech aesthetic, and the oppressive weight of the Meat Oligarchy.
    His Functional skills  are tied directly to this swamp-based, retro-tech life.
    Psychologically, he is a pragmat ist clinging to independence, whose values (self-reliance, suspicion of authority, a touch of celebrity worship for "The Snow man" Jerry Reed) are forged by his environment and social standing.
    He is a product of the post- Calamity world, a living testament to its strange blend of advanced biotech and mandated retro-simplicity.
  primary _narrative_function: >-
    Ground-level viewpoint character illustrating the everyday realities, struggles, and cultural nuances of L ickskillet and the alligator trade.
    Can serve as a reluctant ally, a source of local information, or a representation of  the human cost of the Oligarchy's power.
    Embodies the theme of autonomy vs. oppressive systems within  Primal Mama's unique context.
  key_internal_conflicts: >-
    Need for economic survival vs.  desire for true independence from the Oligarchy.
    Adherence to practical, observable reality vs. ingrained local superstitions /folk beliefs regarding Swamp Witches or the deeper swamp.
    Pride in his craft vs. the demeaning treatment  by more powerful entities.
  potential_for_development: >-
    Could be pushed into more active resistance  against the Oligarchy (Social/Relational change).
    Might be forced to seek aid from distrusted sources (e.g .: a Swamp Witch, an Automaton user, even an Erpenthrope if desperate enough), challenging his Psychological biases.
     Could learn new, unconventional ways to adapt his 1970s tech to gain an edge (Functional change). 
    Discovery of some local secret or encountering a direct manifestation of the supernatural could drastically alter his Epistemic framework.
