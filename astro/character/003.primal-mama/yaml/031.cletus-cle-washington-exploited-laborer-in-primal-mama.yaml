# Introduction : Constituting Fictional Persons Textually
# This protocol guides the detailed definition of Fictional Persons (characters, significant  sentient beings)
# within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters ARE constituted  by the
# bundle of properties authenticated for them by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives).
# They possess no  independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition.
#
# Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating  their properties across
# relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the
# richness, coherence, and potential tensions  within their authenticated bundle, and whose actions are
# logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules.  Remember undersaturation:
# define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

  character_constitution_summary_narr ative_function:
    # Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the  authenticated property bundle.
    core_essence: |
      Cletus "Cle" Washington is constituted as a physical  and psychological embodiment of the human cost of Lickskillet's alligator processing industry, dominated by the faceless meat oligarchy.  His existence is defined by his injuries (Physical), his debt-bondage (Social/Functional), his suppressed despair (Psychological),  and his unwavering devotion to his mother (Motivational). He is a product of Primal Mama's specific post-calam ity socio-economic landscape, where 1970s-era technology in the hands of powerful corporations grinds down  the vulnerable.
    primary_narrative_function: |
      To serve as a poignant example of the systemic exploitation within  Primal Mama's core economy. His plight can act as a catalyst for other characters (e.g., a  truth-seeking Erpenthrope, a reform-minded outsider) or highlight the indifference of the powerful. He grounds the more  fantastical elements of the world in harsh, relatable human suffering.
    key_internal_conflicts_from_bundle:  |
      The need to endure his suffering for his mother's sake vs. the erosion of his own physical and mental well- being. The fear of reprisal from Magnolia Meats vs. the desperate, faint hope for something better or an opportunity for small  acts of defiance/sabotage. The weight of memory (past health, family) vs. the bleakness of the present.
     potential_for_development_based_on_bundle: |
      Could be pushed to a breaking point, leading  to an act of desperate rebellion (likely futile alone). Could find an unlikely ally who offers aid or a path to empowerment. Could succumb  fully to his injuries and despair, serving as a tragic example. His story could expose a deeper corruption within Magnolia Meats or  Lickskillet, drawing in others.
