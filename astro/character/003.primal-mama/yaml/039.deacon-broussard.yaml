  character_constitution_summary_and_narrative_function: # Key name simplified
     core_essence: "Deacon \"Bones\" Broussard is constituted as the embodiment of Lickskillet 's dying independent spirit, a skilled artisan crushed by the inexorable advance of the Meat Oligarchy. His African features place him visibly  within the diverse tapestry of Primal Mama's swamp communities. His identity is defined by what he has *lost* – his business , his status, his livelihood – and the resilient, if bitter, spirit that endures. He is a living testament to the  \"friction\" mentioned in the Primal Mama Coherence Protocol, a direct casualty of the deontic power wielded by the elite.  His adherence to the 1970s aesthetic is not a choice but the ingrained reality of his environment and former  trade." # No colon
    primary_narrative_function: "To serve as a potent symbol of the socio-economic oppression  within Primal Mama; to provide a voice for the disenfranchised of Lickskillet; to act as a potential  source of crucial information or reluctant assistance to protagonists opposing the Oligarchy; to ground the more fantastical elements of Primal Mama in harsh , human-level reality." # No colon
