  Authenticated_Property_Bundle: 
    Physical_Properties:
      Purpose: "Define the character's tangible presence."
      Appearance_General: ' Human male, Erpenthrope. Appears perpetually late 50s, though actual age is far greater. Wir y and weathered, skin like tanned alligator hide from sun and swamp. Surprisingly agile. # Auth: [PMCILP  - Erpenthrope properties; This Codex]'
      Appearance_Specific_Features: "Deep-set, piercing blue  eyes that seem to see more than is there. Long, greying hair and beard, often braided with small, carved  alligator teeth or polished river stones. A prominent, jagged scar bisects his left eyebrow, a memento from a close  encounter in his beast form decades ago. # Auth: [This Codex]"
      Appearance_Distinctive_Marks:  "Faint, scale-like patterning visible on his forearms and neck in certain light â€“ a subtle tell of his Erpenth rope nature even in human form. A faded, hand-poked tattoo of a stylized Bandit Trans Am on his right bicep . # Auth: [This Codex; PMCILP - Erpenthrope traits]"
      Typical_Attire : "Worn, patched-together denim overalls (often with one strap undone) over a faded t-shirt depicting  a celestial alligator. Barefoot or in simple, handmade alligator-skin moccasins. Carries a satchel made  of woven reeds and synthetic 1970s-era orange vinyl, containing his \"sacred texts.\" # Auth: [ This Codex; PMCILP - 1970s Aesthetic]"
      Voice_Speech_Pattern: " Slow, deliberate Southern drawl, surprisingly gentle but capable of booming pronouncements. Often peppers speech with misremembered or  reinterpreted quotes from Burt Reynolds films, Jerry Reed songs, or Gram Parsons' lyrics, treating them as gospel. #  Auth: [This Codex; PMCILP - Deified Celebrities]"
      Gait_Mannerisms: "Moves  with a quiet, almost reptilian grace. Often seen staring intently at the sun, a water reflection, or the intricate patterns of a  cypress knee, as if seeking an omen. Has a habit of humming Gram Parsons tunes almost unconsciously. # Auth: [This Codex]" 
      Associated_Scent_If_Any: "Swamp mud, sun-baked reeds, old paper, and  a faint, almost metallic tang when his Erpenthropic nature is close to the surface. # Auth: [This Codex ]"
      Physical_Undersaturation:
        - "Exact height/weight"
        - "specific details of his All igator Beast Man form beyond \"formidable\""
        - "full inventory of minor personal effects."

    Functional_ Properties:

        - "Oratory & \"Theological\" Interpretation (Can hold listeners  rapt with his unique interpretations of the Deified Trio's \"works\") # Auth: [This Codex]"
         - 'Rudimentary Ritual Magic (Learned fragments for ghost perception, primarily to seek insights from "ancestors" or  those who might have "known" the deities) # Auth: [PMCILP - Spectral Interaction; This Codex]'

        - 'Near-Immortality (Erpenthrope trait; has witnessed vast swathes of post -calamity history) # Auth: [PMCILP - Erpenthrope Modality]'
        -  'Enhanced Solar Energy Absorption (A minor aspect of his Erpenthrope nature, less efficient than GE Alligators but allows  for surprising endurance under the sun) # Auth: [This Codex, logical extension of solar dominance]'
      Limitation_Physical :
        - 'Transformation takes a toll, requiring rest/solar absorption after. Vulnerable to specific, esoteric wards or artifacts designed  to repel/harm Erpenthropes (if such exist). # Auth: [This Codex, narrative balance]'
       Limitation_Knowledge:
        - "His \"theology\" is highly idiosyncratic and based on fragmented, often corrupted pre -calamity media (e.g., worn VHS tapes, garbled audio recordings). Lacks formal technical knowledge  beyond basic swamp mechanics. # Auth: [This Codex; PMCILP - Epistemic Fragmentation]"
      Lim itation_Social:
        - "Often dismissed as a madman or eccentric by urbanites or those heavily invested in mainstream  interpretations of the Deities. Can be unsettling to \"normal\" folk. # Auth: [This Codex]"

      Key_Belief:
        - "The Deified Trio are not just icons but facets of a greater, perhaps even  impersonal, spiritual force that speaks through them. Believes \"Primal Mama\" (the spirit of the world/sw amp) chose them. # Auth: [His Oratory/Theology]"
        - "The 197 0s aesthetic is not mere style, but a divinely inspired \"Golden Age\" framework whose true spiritual significance is yet  to be fully understood. # Auth: [This Codex]"
      Internal_Conflict:
        - "The Erpenthrope 's drive for tangible truth vs. the necessity of faith."
        - "The often crude or contradictory \"scriptures\" ( film plots, song lyrics) vs. the profound spiritual guidance he derives from them."
        - "Loneliness of his unique , long-lived perspective. # Auth: [This Codex, character depth]"
      Subjective_Memory_Content: " Vivid, fragmented memories stretching back centuries; remembers the \"Time of Smoke\" (the calamity) and the \"Silent  Years\" before the Gator Renaissance. Remembers when \"Burt was just Burt,\" making his deification all the more  profound to him. # Auth: [This Codex, leveraging near-immortality]"
      Psychological_Unders aturation:

        - "Devoted to the \" Triune Divinity\" of Reynolds, Reed, and Parsons, and the \"Spirit of Primal Mama.\""

      Social_Undersaturation: 
        - "Specific family ties (likely long gone or irrelevant)"

    Modal_Properties:
      Purpose: 'Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.'
      Properties _List:
        - Property_ID: 'MODAL-JEB-01'
          Property: 'Erp enthropic Nature (Alethic/Epistemic Exception)'
          Description: "Authenticated ability to physically transform into a formidable All igator Beast Man; possesses near-immortality; innately driven to seek \"truth\" as per Erpenth rope kind."
          Limits: "Transformation is taxing; near-immortality does not mean invulnerability; \"truth\" is  subjective and filtered through his unique perspective."
          Authentication: '[PMCILP - Erpenthrope rules]'
         - Property_ID: 'MODAL-JEB-02'
          Property: 'Minor Solar Att unement (Alethic)'
          Description: 'Possesses a subtle, inherent ability to draw sustenance/energy  from solar power, beyond baseline human, tied to his Erpenthrope nature. Not as efficient as GE Alligators but aids  endurance and post-transformation recovery.'
          Limits: 'Cannot survive on solar alone; still requires gator meat. Prolong ed darkness or severe cloud cover will weaken him more than a typical human over time.'
          Authentication: '[This Codex,  consistent with PMCILP Solar Dominance & Alligator Biogenesis]'

      Reputation_Beetriot_Elite _Oligarchs: "Likely 'Superstitious Detritus,' 'Potential Source of Unrest if he gains  followers,' 'Irrelevant Swamp Hermit.' # Auth: [This Codex, logical inference from PMCILP]"
      Rep utation_Other_Erpenthropes: "Possibly 'The Devout One,' 'The Star-Gazer,' or  'He Who Chases Ghosts of Men.' # Auth: [This Codex, potential internal Erpenthrope views]"
      Moral _Alignment_Narrative_Framing: "Authenticated as fundamentally Sincere and Benign in his quest, seeking spiritual understanding,  though his methods and conclusions are eccentric. His \"truth\" is a spiritual one, not necessarily factual in a mundane sense . # Auth: [This Codex, Narrator Tone]"
      Axiological_Undersaturation:
        - "Specific  views from Swamp Witch communities"
        - "reputation among Automaton/LLM users (he'd likely condemn  their use as \"soul-staining\")."

    Historical_Properties:
      Purpose: "Define the character' s known origins and connections to past events."
      Origin: "Authenticated as an Erpenthrope active since at least the early  post-Calamity period. Remembers the world before the mass proliferation of GE Alligators and the full deification of  the Trio. # Auth: [This Codex, based on near-immortality]"
      Key_Past_ Event_Connection_Subjective: "Claims to have once, in his youth (centuries ago), seen a \"Chariot  of Fire with a Screaming Chicken painted on its hood\" (a Trans Am) which he considers his first \"vision.\" Witness ed the societal shift away from cattle firsthand. # Auth: [This Codex]"
      Inherited_Items: "His primary \" sacred texts\": a water-damaged movie poster for \"Gator,\" a cracked 8-track of Jerry Reed's \" East Bound and Down,\" and a few singed pages purported to be from Gram Parsons' personal notebook (authenticity highly dubious  but cherished by Jeb). # Auth: [This Codex]"
      Historical_Undersaturation:
        - "Specific s of his life before dedicating himself to this quest"
        - "any direct interaction with the Deified Trio ( highly unlikely, but he might claim spiritual communion that feels like memory)"
        - "His own Erpenthrope  lineage/origin."

  Character_Constitution_Summary_Narrative_Function:
    Purpose: "Synthesize the core  identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    Core_Essence: "Brother  Jebediah is constituted as an ancient, truth-seeking Erpenthrope who has found his ultimate \"truth\" in  the unlikely divinity of 20th-century celebrities. His existence is a living embodiment of Primal Mama's \" strangely spiritual miasma,\" blending sincere faith with the patently absurd. His near-immortality gives him a unique perspective  on the transience of human works versus the enduring power of belief and the \"spirit\" he perceives in the Deified  Trio and the 1970s aesthetic. He is a wandering prophet of a uniquely Primal Maman gospel, seeking  communion with gods made of celluloid, vinyl, and legend, all under the omnipresent solar gaze."
    Primary _Narrative_Function: "To embody and explore the unique spiritual dimension of Primal Mama. Acts as a source  of esoteric lore, philosophical musings, and unexpected wisdom. Can serve as a quest-giver, a mystical guide,  a prophetic voice, or a poignant example of faith in a bizarre world. His quest for \"God\" can mirror or contrast with  other characters' quests for more material or mundane goals."
    Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle:
      -  "The Erpenthrope's innate drive for tangible \"truth\" versus the abstract, often contradictory nature of his  chosen faith."
      - "The immense loneliness of his unique, long-lived perspective and singular devotion."
       - "Interpreting the flawed, human actions of his \"gods\" (as depicted in their \"scriptures \") through a divine lens."
      - "The struggle to convey his profound spiritual insights to a largely uncomprehending world." 
    Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle:
      - "Could uncover a \"lost relic\" or  \"sacred site\" related to one of the Trio."
      - "Might attract a small following, forcing him into a leadership  role."
      - "Could have a crisis of faith if confronted with irrefutable evidence contradicting a core tenet, or conversely , have a profound revelatory experience that solidifies his beliefs."
      - "His interaction with actual ghosts might yield \" messages\" from the deified."
      - "He might eventually seek to understand the \"Invisible Women\" conspiracy through  a spiritual, rather than purely conspiratorial, lens."
