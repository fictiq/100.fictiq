  introduction: |
     This protocol guides the detailed definition of Fictional Persons (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama  heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters ARE constituted by the bundle of properties authenticated for them by the authoritative  narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition.

    Use  this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises  from the richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember undersaturation: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

  character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
    purpose: "Synthesize the core  identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    core_essence: |
       Leroy 'Lucky' Coombs is constituted as a casualty of Primal Mama's brutal socio-economic landscape, a man whose  traditional livelihood and pride were systematically dismantled by the powerful meat oligarchy and the societal pitfalls of ill-understood technology (Automat ons). He embodies the human cost of "progress" in a world clinging to a retro-futuristic aesthetic, representing  the fading independence of the "mom-and-pop" ethos against centralized, impersonal power. His African heritage connects him to a deep , resilient history, now overshadowed by personal and economic tragedy in the bayou.
    primary_narrative_function: | 
      To serve as a living testament to the predatory practices of the Beetriot Meat Trust, embodying the plight of the dispossessed in  Primal Mama. He can act as a reluctant informant, a cautionary tale, or a potential (if deeply pessimistic)  ally for protagonists seeking to challenge the status quo. His story highlights the "friction" caused by the oligarchy and the very real consequences  of the Automaton user stigma.
    key_internal_conflicts: "Resentful anger vs. crushing  weariness; pride in old ways vs. the shame of obsolescence and Automaton failure; desire for justice vs.  the pragmatic fear of the Trust's retribution; hope for his daughter vs. the despair of his situation."
     potential_for_development: |
      Leroy could be pushed to a breaking point, leading to a desperate act  of defiance. He might find a new purpose in guiding or aiding others. There's potential for him to reclaim a  small piece of his dignity, or conversely, to sink further into despair and become a tool for darker forces. His knowledge  of old swamp ways and pre-GE gator lore could become unexpectedly valuable.
