      Description: 'Authenticated ability  to perceive and interpret subtle spiritual "echoes" or "signatures" related to Gram Parsons'' influence or presence in specific  locations or objects, beyond what ordinary believers experience. This allows him to "divine" locations of potential significance to his quest.'
       Limits: 'Subjective and intuitive, not scientifically verifiable. Perception is often vague, requiring interpretation through prayer, song , and meditation. Does not grant foresight or direct communication, more like feeling "warm" or "cold" in a  spiritual sense.'
      Authentication: 'Narrative descriptions of his "hunches" leading to discoveries; character dialogue explaining his "feel ings" about places/items; success in finding obscure "relics" or places of meaning.'
    Note : 'This modal property is subtle, framing his deep faith and intuition as a minor, personalized exception to purely mundane perception within the  world''s spiritual framework.'

  Axiological_Properties:
    Purpose: "Define the character's  value status *within* Primal Mama."
    Reputation_Rural_Swamp_Communities:
      value: "Authenticated  as viewed as a 'holy man' by some, a 'wandering singer with a good heart' by others, 'a  bit touched but harmless'. His music is often genuinely appreciated."
      auth: Community interactions
    Reputation_Beet riot_Oligarchy_Circles:
      value: "If known at all, likely dismissed as 'irrelevant  swamp folk', 'religious fanatic', or 'nostalgic nuisance'."
      auth: Implied by cultural divide
     Moral_Alignment_Narrative_Framing:

      auth: 'Narrator tone, plot outcomes favoring his gentle nature'
    Axiological_Und ersaturation: 'Reputation among Erpenthropes or more organized "Church of the Trio" clergy.'

  Historical _Properties:
    Purpose: "Define the character's known origins and connections to past events."
    Origin :
      value: 'Authenticated as having a "moment of awakening" years after the Biological Calamity, where  a scratchy broadcast of a Gram Parsons song (perhaps "Return of the Grievous Angel" or "In My Hour of Darkness ") heard on a salvaged 1970s radio provided profound solace and a new purpose during a personal crisis. Details of  his life before this are intentionally vague and unauthenticated, even to him.'
      auth: Character backstory revealed in dialogue/ monologue
    Key_Past_Event_Connection_Subjective:
      value: 'Believes the spirit  of Gram Parsons directly intervened or guided him during his "awakening." Considers the era of Parsons (late 1 960s-early 1970s) a lost golden age of spiritual truth, reflected in the  world''s enforced 1970s aesthetic, which he sees as a sign.'
      auth: Character  beliefs
    Inherited_Items:
      value: "Authenticated to possess a tattered songbook with handwritten notes  and interpretations of Parsons' lyrics, which he treats as scripture. His guitar might be a \"found relic\" or a lovingly maintained instrument  from his pre-pilgrimage life."
      auth: Narrative inventory
    Historical_Undersaturation: ' Specifics of his pre-awakening life, family, original occupation. The exact nature of his personal crisis leading to  his faith.'

Character_Constitution_Summary_Narrative_Function:
  Purpose: 'Synthesize the core  identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.'
  Core_Essence: 'Brother  Amos is constituted as a vessel of sincere, melancholic faith in a world of bizarre pragmatism and retro-futuristic odd ities. His identity is woven from Gram Parsons'' perceived spiritual legacy, seeking solace and "truth" not in empirical fact (like  Erpenthropes) or worldly power (like the Oligarchy), but in the "Cosmic American Music" that he believes  holds the key to spiritual survival in Primal Mama. His adherence to the 1970s aesthetic is not  merely stylistic but a reflection of his belief in the spiritual authenticity of that era, which he believes the world unconsciously mimics.'
   Primary_Narrative_Function: 'To embody the "strangely spiritual miasma" of Primal Mama;  to offer a counterpoint to cynical or purely materialist perspectives; to serve as a source of lore about the Deified Trio (especially  Parsons); to potentially guide protagonists to unexpected truths or offer moments of beauty/solace; to highlight the diverse ways beings in Primal  Mama cope with and interpret their reality.'
  Key_Internal_Conflicts: 'Maintaining pure faith amidst pervasive weirdness and corruption ; reconciling the beautiful ideals of Parsons'' music with the often harsh realities of survival; the loneliness of his unique path versus  the desire to share his perceived divine connection; the struggle to interpret the "signs" and "resonances" he perceives .'
  Potential_for_Development: 'Deepening his understanding of "God" (Parsons'' spirit) through encounters  or "relic" discoveries; facing a crisis of faith or a challenge to his interpretations; forming an unlikely alliance with  other truth-seekers (e.g., an Erpenthrope, a disillusioned Automaton user); potentially becoming a more influential  spiritual figure or, conversely, retreating further into hermitage.'
