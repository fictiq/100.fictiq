introduction_text: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional  Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex , core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.
  Use this template to systematically  build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence , and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's  rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

    core_essence: |
      Agnes "Mama Gator" Beauregard is  constituted as the tenacious heart of Lickskillet's traditional alligator processing economy. She is a pragmatic, fiercely independent woman whose  identity is interwoven with her craft, her 1970s-aesthetic business, and her bayou community.  Her Functional expertise in alligator butchery and small-scale business is constantly tested by the Economic limitations imposed by the meat oligarchy.  Psychologically, she embodies resilience and a deep-seated belief in "honest work," drawing on a culturally ingrained reverence for Southern  ideals (as filtered through the celebrity deities) and a distrust of impersonal corporate power and advanced, "soulless" tech like  Automatons. Her Social position as a respected local leader provides a counterpoint to the faceless oligarchy.
    primary _narrative_function: |
      To represent the "mom-and-pop" sector of Primal Mama' s core economy; to embody the spirit and struggles of Lickskillet; to act as a source of local knowledge , quests, or aid for protagonists; to highlight the socio-economic "friction" created by the meat oligarchy and the tension  between tradition and external pressures.
    key_internal_conflicts_from_bundle:
      - "Maintaining  independence vs. economic survival pressures from the oligarchy"
      - "Upholding traditional methods vs. the need to adapt ( within 70s tech limits) to remain viable"
      - "Loyalty to community vs. personal wear iness/desire for a simpler life (potential)"
    potential_for_development_based_on_bundle : |
      Could become a focal point for local resistance against the oligarchy (Social/Relational change); Might be  forced to make a difficult alliance or adopt a risky new (but still 70s-tech) processing method ( Functional/Economic change); Could pass on her knowledge/business to a new generation (Historical/Legacy change).
