  CharacterConstitutionSummaryAndNarrativeFunction:
    CoreEssence: |
      Jedidiah Moreau is constituted  as a hardworking, resilient family man whose traditional livelihood as a small-scale alligator farmer in Primal Mama's swamps is being  systematically dismantled by the exploitative practices of the powerful Meat Oligarchy. His identity is rooted in his connection to the land, his family , and a dying way of self-sufficient life that clashes with the retro-futuristic corporate dominance. He embodies the human cost of  the oligarchy's "friction," fighting a losing battle with 1970s-era grit against technologically -enabled greed. His African heritage grounds him in a specific cultural lineage within the diverse bayou tapestry, adding depth to  his struggle for legacy and survival.
    PrimaryNarrativeFunction: |
      To serve as a primary example and human face of  the Meat Oligarchy's oppressive influence on the common folk of Lickskillet and the swamp regions. His plight can drive sub plots, motivate other characters to action (either to help him or to avoid his fate), or serve as a moral touch stone highlighting the injustices within Primal Mama's society. He represents the tension between traditional autonomy and encroaching, impersonal  corporate power.
    KeyInternalConflicts: |
      The need to provide for his family vs. the crushing economic  pressure from the oligarchy; His ingrained sense of pride and independence vs. the humiliating necessity of compliance or seeking aid;  The desire for justice/retribution vs. the pragmatic fear of severe repercussions for himself and his loved ones; Hope that things might  improve vs. the encroaching despair of his situation.
    PotentialForDevelopment: |
      Jed could be pushed to a  breaking point, leading to desperate actions (rebellion, sabotage, seeking forbidden aid from Swamp Witches or even Erpenthropes ). He might become a reluctant leader for other victimized farmers, or his tragedy could inspire a protagonist. Alternatively, he could succumb entirely , serving as a cautionary tale. His relationship with the 'Invisible Women' conspiracy could evolve if he seeks explanations for his  suffering.
