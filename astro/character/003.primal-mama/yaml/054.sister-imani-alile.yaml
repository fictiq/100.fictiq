  Authenticated_Property_Bundle:
    Physical_Properties:
       Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.
      Properties:
        - Appearance_General: "Human female, mid -40s, with a dignified bearing. Dark, rich umber skin. Appears weathered by sun and swamp air but  possesses a vibrant energy. # Auth: [This Codex]"
        - Appearance_Specific_Features: "High cheekbones, expressive  dark brown eyes that seem to observe deeply. Full lips often set in a thoughtful or gently determined expression. Hair is a mass of  tightly coiled, short locs, sometimes adorned with carved alligator teeth or polished river stones. # Auth: [This Codex]"
         - Appearance_Distinctive_Marks: "Faint, intricate scar patterns on her forearms, resembling abstracted solar flares or water  ripples â€“ self-inflicted as part of past meditative rituals. A single, small silver stud in her left nostril,  crafted to look like a miniature alligator scale. # Auth: [This Codex]"
        - Typical_Attire: "Practical , durable clothing dyed in earthen tones (ochre, deep green, brown) from swamp plants. Often wears a sleeveless , long vest made of woven reeds and recycled synthetic fibers, over a simple, long-sleeved tunic and sturdy trousers  tucked into knee-high, waterproof boots. Her garments often have subtle stitched patterns reminiscent of 1970s geometric designs , but made with natural threads. # Auth: [This Codex - Visual Concept]"
        - Voice_Speech_Pattern:  "A calm, melodic alto voice. Speaks deliberately, often pausing to choose words carefully. Possesses a unique cadence, not  quite the Lickskillet drawl, hinting at a different upbringing or a conscious cultivation of speech. Sometimes incorporates resonant  hums or clicks when emphasizing a point in her more esoteric discussions. # Auth: [This Codex - Dialogue Direction]"
        -  Gait_Mannerisms: "Moves with a quiet grace, whether navigating treacherous swamp terrain or a cluttered Lickskillet  market. Has a habit of tilting her head when listening intently, and her hands are often gently clasped or making slow, deliberate  gestures when she explains her ideas. Frequently observed gazing at the sun (indirectly) or large bodies of water. # Auth:  [This Codex - Action Description]"
        - Associated_Scent_If_Any: "Faint aroma of sun -dried herbs, damp earth, and a subtle metallic tang from her \"experimental\" devices. # Auth: [This Codex - Sensory  Palette]"
      Undersaturation_Notes: "Exact height/weight; specific details of her pre-Lickskillet life  attire; full range of subtle expressions."

    Functional_Properties:
      Purpose: Define what the character CAN and CAN NOT do.
      Properties:
        - Skill_Expert_Forager_Herbalist: "Swamp  Ecosystem: Able to identify and utilize a vast array of swamp plants for sustenance, minor remedies, and ritual components. # Auth : [Demonstrated in local interactions]"
        - Skill_Rudimentary_Ritualist: "Self-Taught/ Syncretic: Can perform basic cleansing rites, minor protective charms, and attempts at ghost communication, often incorporating solar alignments and natural  elements. Her methods are idiosyncratic and not aligned with established Swamp Witch lore, often involving cobbled-together devices with 1970 s aesthetic components (e.g., a \"spirit-resonance tuner\" with chunky dials and an analog needle display,  powered by a small solar cell). # Auth: [Narrative Description of her practices; Primal Mama Modalities -  Spectral Interaction, Solar Dominance, Tech Aesthetic Constraint]"
        - Skill_Keen_Observation_Pattern_Recognition:  "Applied to Spirituality: Can spend hours observing natural phenomena (alligator behavior, light patterns on water, ghost manifestations) seeking  deeper meanings and connections to the \"Divine Source\" she postulates. # Auth: [Core aspect of her character]"
        -  Ability_Unique_Minor_Empathic_Resonance: "Heightened Empathic Resonance with Environment: A subtle,  intuitive sense of ecological/spiritual \"disturbances\" or concentrations of unusual energy in her immediate surroundings. Not overtly supernatural,  more like extreme intuitive sensitivity. # Auth: [Narrative cues, her own interpretations of feelings]"
        - Limitation_Knowledge : "Lacks formal training in advanced science (GE, solar engineering beyond basic principles) or established esoteric traditions (Sw amp Witch high magic, Erpenthrope lore). Her knowledge is experiential, experimental, and often highly subjective. # Auth : [Contrast with specialized world roles]"
        - Limitation_Social: "Seen as an eccentric outsider in Lick skillet; lacks significant influence or resources. Her pursuit is solitary, and she faces skepticism from adherents of the celebrity gods or those  focused on mundane survival. # Auth: [Social Status Property; Primal Mama Modalities - Deified Celebrities,  Axiological values]"
        - Limitation_Technological: "Her \"experimental devices\" are crude, built from salvaged parts adhering  to the 1970s aesthetic, and their efficacy is based more on her belief and ritual focus than proven  scientific principles within the Primal Mama framework. They are tools for focusing her intent. # Auth: [Primal Mama  Modalities - Tech Aesthetic Constraint]"
      Undersaturation_Notes: "Combat skills (likely minimal); ability to pilot complex  watercraft; detailed knowledge of Beetriot politics."

    Psychological_Properties:
      Purpose: Define the character's  textually constituted inner life.
      Properties:
        - Core_Trait_Spiritual_Yearning: "Pro found Spiritual Yearning: A deep-seated need to understand the fundamental nature of existence and connect with a \"True Divine\" beyond  the authenticated celebrity gods or the transactional nature of ghost interaction. # Auth: [Primary Motivator]"
        - Core_ Trait_Intellectual_Humility_Openness: "Willing to consider unconventional ideas and learn from any source ( nature, ghosts, even the ravings of a drunkard if a spark of insight is there), but also rigorously questions her own  findings. # Auth: [Her experimental approach]"
        - Core_Trait_Quiet_Resilience: "Faces  skepticism and occasional mockery with equanimity, sustained by her inner conviction. # Auth: [Interactions, persistence]"
         - Dominant_Emotion: "A blend of focused curiosity and serene determination, occasionally tinged with frustration at the el usiveness of her goal or the limitations of her understanding. # Auth: [Narrator Descriptions]"
        - Key_Motiv ator: "To \"authenticate\" the presence and nature of a singular, universal Divine Source/Consciousness within the Primal Mama  world, distinct from the culturally accepted deities or chaotic spectral realm. She seeks \"God's blueprint\" in the reformed world. #  Auth: [Explicit Character Goal]"
        - Key_Belief: "The Biological Calamity, while devastating , was not an ending but a transformation that might have stripped away illusions, potentially making the \"True Divine\" more accessible to those  who know how to look. Believes the sun's \"incredible energy\" is a primary manifestation of this Divine. # Auth:  [Her philosophical stance; Primal Mama Modalities - Calamity Aftermath, Solar Dominance]"
        - Internal_Conflict : "The pull of her intuitive, faith-based insights vs. her desire for some form of repeatable, observable \"evidence \" (within her limited means). The isolation of her unique quest vs. a human need for community/validation. Nav igating the world's absurdities while seeking ultimate meaning. # Auth: [Narrative tension]"
        - Subjective_Memory _Content: "Clear memories of a childhood in a small, isolated community (location vague, possibly pre-dating current  Lickskillet prominence) that held different, nature-focused spiritual beliefs. A pivotal memory of witnessing a particularly potent (and  perhaps terrifying) spectral manifestation during a community ritual, which both solidified her belief in other realities and made her question the local  elders' interpretations. # Auth: [Backstory Element]"
      Undersaturation_Notes: "Specifics of her early  community's beliefs beyond \"nature-focused\"; her opinions on mundane matters like alligator meat seasoning preferences; her views on the \" invisible women\" conspiracy (likely sees it as another layer of misdirection from deeper truths)."

    Social_Relational_Categorical _Properties:
      Purpose: Define the character's place within the world's networks.
      Properties:
        -  Official_Role: "None. Self-styled \"Seeker of the Unseen\" or \"Sister\" by affect ation/local habit. # Auth: [Character Concept]"
        - Social_Status: "Fringe Dweller /  Eccentric Mystic (in Lickskillet). Respected by a small few for her wisdom or herbal skills, mostly tolerated  or ignored. Not subject to the Automaton/LLM user stigma as she eschews such tech, but her un orthodoxy creates a different kind of social distance. # Auth: [Interactions, Primal Mama Modalities - Automaton Stigma ]"
        - Primary_Affiliation: "None formal. Considers herself affiliated with \"All That Is\" or  the \"Great Mystery.\" # Auth: [Her own pronouncements]"
        - Secondary_Affiliations_Informal _Potential: "Occasional barter-based interactions with Swamp Witches for rare herbs or information (approaches them with cautious  respect, seeking knowledge not power). May cautiously approach Erpenthropes if encountered, seeing them as beings potentially closer to fundamental  truths, though likely wary of their transformative nature. # Auth: [Plausible interactions based on world logic]"
        - Key _Relationship_1_To_Divine_Source: "Abstract: Her primary, consuming relationship is with this concept she seeks to  understand and connect with. # Auth: [Core Motivation]"
        - Key_Relationship_2_To_Lickskillet _Community: "Tenuous: Provides occasional herbal remedies or cryptic advice; they provide her a place to exist on the periphery . Some children are fascinated by her stories/devices. # Auth: [Local Interactions]"
        - Key_Relationship_3_ To_Specific_Ghosts: "Transactional/Observational: She attempts to commune with ghosts not just for information, but to understand  their state of being and its relation to the Divine. Some ghosts might be drawn to her unique, non-exploitative  approach. # Auth: [Primal Mama Modalities - Spectral Interaction]"
        - Species_Type: Human (Baseline Primal  Mama Strain) # Auth: [Default]
      Undersaturation_Notes: "Specific named friends or enemies within Licksk illet; detailed interactions with the meat oligarchy (likely avoids them); family ties (presumed lost or distant)."

    Modal _Properties:
      Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.
      Properties:
        - Property_ID:  "MODAL-IMA-01"
          Name: "Spiritual Attunement (Minor Epistemic/ Alethic Nuance)"
          Description: "Authenticated as possessing a heightened, intuitive sensitivity to ambient spiritual/other worldly energies and their fluctuations, beyond typical human perception in Primal Mama. This allows her to identify locations, times, or conditions  more conducive to her \"experiments\" (e.g., when the \"veil is thin\" or \"solar energies are potent\ "). It does not grant control or specific knowledge, merely a refined sense of spiritual \"weather.\" # Auth: [Narr ative descriptions of her successfully finding \"quiet spots\" for ghost contact or \"energized zones\" for solar meditation; her  internal monologue reflecting these perceptions; contrast with others' obliviousness to these subtle cues.]"
          Limits: "Passive  perception; no direct power or ability to command supernatural forces. Can be misleading if misinterpreted. Does not equate to Swamp Witch magic or Er penthrope abilities."
          Authentication: "[Narrative descriptions of her successfully finding \"quiet spots\" for ghost contact or \" energized zones\" for solar meditation; her internal monologue reflecting these perceptions; contrast with others' obliviousness to these subtle  cues.]" # Note: Authentication detail duplicated here from Description for explicit field as per typical Modal structure, adjust if redundant .

    Axiological_Properties:
      Purpose: "Define the character's value status *within* Primal  Mama."
      Properties:
        - Reputation_Lickskillet_General: "\"that peculiar Imani woman,\" \"the  God-seeker,\" \"a bit touched but harmless,\" \"knows her swamp plants.\" Not considered a threat, nor a significant community  asset by most. # Auth: [Local dialogue/reactions]"
        - Reputation_Among_Few_Seekers _Disenfranchised: "Authenticated as a source of alternative wisdom, a quiet comforter, someone who \"sees different.\" #  Auth: [Specific character interactions]"
        - Reputation_Potential_Orthodox_Worshippers: "If her  views became widely known or challenged dominant beliefs, she could be seen as \"blasphemous\" or \"dangerous,\" though  her current obscurity protects her. # Auth: [Inference from Primal Mama Axiological Modalities]"
        - Moral_Alignment _Narrative_Framing: "Authenticated via narrative focus as genuinely seeking profound truth and spiritual understanding for its own sake , generally benevolent and non-interfering unless profound injustice related to her core values is witnessed. # Auth: [ Narrator tone, character actions]"
      Undersaturation_Notes: "Her reputation in Beetriot (likely unknown); how  an Erpenthrope might value her quest; specific views from the meat oligarchy (likely irrelevant to them unless she interferes with alligator  supply)."

    Historical_Properties:
      Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events .
      Properties:
        - Origin: "Authenticated as arriving in the outskirts of Lickskillet approx.  10 years prior to \"current narrative time.\" Came from a smaller, more isolated swamp settlement (name lost or unimportant ) that was eventually subsumed by ecological changes or dispersed due to internal schism over spiritual practices following a significant spectral event. # Auth : [Character Backstory Snippets]"
        - Key_Past_Event_Connection_Subjective: "The aforementioned  \"Significant Spectral Event\" in her home community: This event (e.g., a mass haunting, a powerful uncontrolled  manifestation) shattered her inherited belief system and ignited her personal quest for a more fundamental, less chaotic understanding of the divine/supernatural . This event is why she distrusts unmediated, raw spectral interaction as a sole path to truth. # Auth: [ Internal Monologue, Core Motivation Driver]"
        - Inherited_Items: "A small, smooth, dark stone she believes  \"holds the silence of the deep swamp\"; a few faded, hand-scribed pages of her former community's nature parables , which she now reinterprets in light of her broader search. # Auth: [Narrative inventory]"
       Undersaturation_Notes: "The precise nature and doctrines of her original community; specific details of the \"Spectral Event\"; her  life between leaving her home and arriving near Lickskillet."

  Character_Constitution_Summary_Narrative_Function: 
    Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.
    Core _Essence: "Sister Imani Alile is constituted as a gentle but resolute spiritual experimentalist, an ontological detective seeking the \"Divine  Source Code\" of a world radically reshaped by calamity and dominated by retro-futuristic absurdity and celebrity worship. Her African  features and unique name mark her as distinct, perhaps a carrier of fragmented pre-calamity cultural echoes reinterpreted through her  personal spiritual lens. Her \"experiments\" â€“ a blend of swamp folk knowledge, self-taught ritual, and cobbled-together 1 970s-aesthetic devices powered by solar faith â€“ are her method of interrogating Primal Mama's bizarre reality for a  deeper, unifying truth. She embodies a quiet defiance against the accepted spiritual norms (celebrity gods, purely transactional ghost contact),  seeking a more profound connection that transcends the pervasive \"miasma.\""
    Primary_Narrative_Function: "To  serve as a source of alternative spiritual/philosophical perspective; a potential guide or catalyst for protagonists questioning the world's  established truths; a living commentary on the nature of faith, belief, and the search for meaning in a chaotic, transformed world . Her quest can intersect with deeper lore about the calamity, the nature of ghosts, or even the consciousness of GE Alligators or  Erpenthropes. She can provide unique insights or MacGuffins related to \"spiritual technology\" or sacred  natural sites."
    Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: "The profound loneliness of her unique spiritual path vs . innate human desire for understanding/community. The drive for empirical (in her own way) \"proof\" of the divine vs.  the necessity of faith and intuition. The tension between the beauty/order she seeks (and sometimes glimpses, especially in solar patterns  or deep nature) and the pervasive chaos/absurdity of Primal Mama. The challenge of using the \"tools of  the world\" (salvaged 1970s tech, swamp resources) to transcend that world's  limitations."
    Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle: "Making a breakthrough in her \"experiments\" ( e.g., a consistent method of benign spirit communication, discovery of a place of unique spiritual power). Gaining reluctant  followers or an unexpected ally (an Erpenthrope curious about her methods? A disillusioned celebrity god priest?). Her quest leading her to  an unexpected truth about the calamity or the \"gods.\" Having to defend her beliefs or practices against more orthodox forces."
