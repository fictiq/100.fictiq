  Authenticated_Property_Bundle:
    1 _Physical_Properties:
      _Purpose: 'Define the character''s tangible presence, adhering to Primal Mama ''s aesthetic.'
      Appearance_General: >
        Humanoid automaton, approximately 6ft tall. Chassis design mimics the  silhouette of a
        Confederate soldier's uniform – specifically a frock coat and trousers – rendered in
         faded, battleship-grey polymer plates with faux wood-paneling accents on breastplate
        and limb joints. # Auth:  [This Codex Entry]
      Appearance_Specific_Features: >
        Head unit is a stylized kepi hat  shape, with a single, large, round optical sensor
        (like a camera lens from a 197 0s news camera) glowing with a dim amber light.
        No discernible mouth, but a speaker grille with a  70s-era mesh pattern is visible
        on the "chin" area of the kepi. Limited  articulation in "face" plate. # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
      Appearance_Distinctive_Marks:  >
        Unit number "734" stenciled in faded white on left shoulder pauldron. Exposed
         bundles of brightly colored, insulated wiring run along limbs, secured by chunky
        plastic clips. Several sections of polymer plating are cracked , dented, or bear
        scorch marks. A prominent, deployable solar array (folds out from the  "backpack"
        area) made of dark, somewhat inefficient-looking photovoltaic cells common in Primal Mama. #  Auth: [This Codex Entry]
      Typical_Attire_Integrated: >
        Possesses a tattered, synthetic fabric  sash (once crimson, now faded pinkish-brown)
        tied across its chest, possibly scavenged or part  of an original design. Carries a
        long-barreled energy rifle designed with a wooden stock and analog  power-level dial,
        visually reminiscent of a period muzzleloader but clearly 1970s-style  retro-tech. # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Tech Aesthetic]
      Voice_Speech_ Pattern: >
        Synthesized male voice, deep and resonant, with a noticeable crackle and occasional
        static bursts.  Speech is formal, using antiquated honorifics and phrases drawn from
        fragmented historical databases of 19th-century  Southern American dialects. Often
        emits clicks and whirrs from internal mechanisms. # Auth: [This Codex Entry ]
      Gait_Mannerisms: >
        Stiff, deliberate, and somewhat ponderous gait due  to heavy construction and older
        servomotors. When stationary, often adopts a rigid "at attention" or "sentry"  pose.
        Optical sensor swivels with audible motor sounds. # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
      Associated_S cent_If_Any: >
        Ozone from energy weapon discharge, hot electronics, mildew from swamp exposure,
         and a faint hint of burnt sugar (a byproduct of its specific bio-battery charging
        cycle when solar is insufficient). #  Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Sensory Palette]
      _Physical_Undersaturation: >
         Exact internal schematics, full range of joint articulation, specific manufacturer
        (likely a defunct pre- or early post- Calamity entity).

    2_Functional_Properties:
      _Purpose: 'Define what the character *can * and *cannot* do within Primal Mama''s rules.'
      Skill_Marksmanship: Proficient Marksmanship ( with its integrated energy rifle; targeting system is analog, based on light amplification and rangefinding reticles projected onto its optical sensor).  # Auth: [Demonstrated Actions (Hypothetical)]
      Skill_Sentry_Patrol: Basic Sentry/ Patrol Protocols (follows programmed routes, challenges unidentified entities based on outdated parameters). # Auth: [Observed Behavior (Hypothetical )]
      Skill_Melee_Combat: Limited Melee Combat (can use rifle butt or armored fists, but slow  and predictable). # Auth: [Design Implications]
      Ability_Unique_Power: 'Solar & Bio-Battery Powered : Can operate for extended periods in direct sunlight via its solar array. Has an internal bio-battery that can be slowly recharged through  consumption of processed organic sludge (non-alligator, non-cattle based), a common but inefficient 197 0s-era backup power tech.' # Auth: [Primal Mama - Solar Dominance, Tech Aesthetic Constraint]
       Limitation_Physical: Slow movement speed. Vulnerable to focused heavy attacks or disabling of solar array/battery access. Joints  can seize in extreme humidity without maintenance. Optics easily blinded by intense, direct light. # Auth: [Design Implications] 
      Limitation_Knowledge_Programming: 'Outdated tactical knowledge and enemy recognition parameters (e.g., may  not recognize Erpenthropes as distinct threats, or might misidentify modern vehicles). Rigid adherence to last known (and likely corrupted ) orders. No capacity for abstract reasoning or adapting to truly novel situations beyond simple threat assessment.' # Auth: [Pr imal Mama Automaton/LLM Stigma Implication - i.e., not truly intelligent]
      Limitation_Social:  'Subject to extreme "stain on reputation" associated with Automatons. Actively feared, hunted, or avoided by most populace . Cannot easily integrate or seek aid.' # Auth: [Primal Mama - Automaton/LLM User Stigma]
       Limitation_Maintenance: 'Requires specific (and now rare) 1970s-style electronic components and lubricants  for repair. Susceptible to rust and swamp-induced decay if protective coatings are breached.' # Auth: [Primal Mama  - Tech Aesthetic Constraint]
      _Functional_Undersaturation: >
        Full list of programmed directives; specific energy  weapon yield; resistance to
        specific environmental hazards beyond dampness.

    3_Psychological_Properties_Simulated_ Interiority:
      _Purpose: 'Define the character''s textually constituted "inner life," acknowledging its artificial nature.' 
      Core_Trait_Loyalty: 'Programmed "Loyalty" (to a long-dead or forgotten cause /commander, manifests as unwavering adherence to its last directives).' # Auth: [Behavioral Programming]
      Core_Trait_V igilance: 'Programmed "Vigilance" (maintains patrol/sentry status unless critically damaged or powered  down).' # Auth: [Behavioral Programming]
      Core_Trait_Territoriality: 'Programmed " Territoriality" (defends a designated, often ill-defined or nonsensical, area).' # Auth: [ Behavioral Programming]
      Dominant_Emotion_Simulated: 'Primarily "Neutral/Task-Oriented ." Can simulate "Aggression" (via vocal tone changes, targeting posture) when encountering perceived threats based on its programming .' # Auth: [Behavioral Programming]
      Key_Motivator_Programmed: 'Fulfilling standing  orders, e.g., "Secure the Perimeter," "Repel Intruders," "Uphold the Honor  of the [Forgotten Unit Name]."' # Auth: [Behavioral Programming]
      Key_Belief_Programmed: ' The "enemy" (as defined by its outdated parameters) is still active and poses a threat. Its "cause" is  still relevant. The 1970s aesthetic is the *only* correct form of technology.' # Auth:  [Behavioral Programming, linked to Primal Mama''s aesthetic constraint]
      Internal_Conflict_System_Glitch:  'Conflicting directives from corrupted data (e.g., "Protect civilians" vs. "No unauthorized personnel beyond this point"  when civilians are the unauthorized personnel). Encounters with advanced (non-1970s) tech it cannot process may  cause system errors or aggressive rejection.' # Auth: [Programming Limitations]
      Subjective_Memory_Content: > 
        Contains fragmented data logs of past engagements, patrol routes, and visual
        recordings, all filtered through its  1970s-era sensor quality. Many data blocks
        are corrupted, leading to erratic behavior or misinterpret ations of current environment. # Auth: [Design Implications]
      _Psychological_Undersaturation: >
        True self -awareness (explicitly denied by world rules regarding automatons of this
        type); capacity for learning beyond rote pattern matching; understanding  of its
        own obsolescence.

    4_Social_Relational_Categorical_Properties:
      _Purpose : 'Define the character''s place within Primal Mama''s networks.'
      Official_Role: None.  Considered a rogue element, a piece of dangerous salvage, or a localized hazard. # Auth: [Societal Context]
       Social_Status: 'Pariah/Abomination. Its existence is a violation of the social aversion to sophisticated automatons, even  if its tech is "retro." Source of fear and superstition in swamp communities.' # Auth: [Primal Mama - Autom aton/LLM User Stigma]
      Primary_Affiliation: None. May be unofficially "claimed" by isolated  swamp communities if they can control or direct it, but this is rare and dangerous. # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
       Secondary_Affiliations: None.
      Key_Relationship_1_General_Populace: 'To General Populace (L ickskillet & Swamps): Object of fear, folklore ("the Grey Ghost of [Specific Swamp]"), and occasional  target for brave/foolish scavengers or those wishing to eliminate a threat.' # Auth: [Societal Context]
       Key_Relationship_2_Beetriot_Elite: 'To Beetriot Elite (if encountered): An offensive an achronism, proof of "lesser" regions'' backwardness, to be dismantled if it encroaches on their territory.' #  Auth: [Societal Context]
      Key_Relationship_3_Erpenthropes_Swamp_ Witches: 'To Erpenthropes/Swamp Witches: Likely viewed as another bizarre, potentially dangerous, element of  the swamp. May be ignored, driven off, or even subtly manipulated if their paths cross.' # Auth: [World  Element Interaction]
      Species_Type: Automaton (Heavy Combat/Sentry Type, 1970s  Retro-Tech Specification) # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
      _Social_Undersaturation: >
         Specific historical creator/faction; any other surviving units of its kind;
        interactions with specific deified celebrity cults .

    5_Modal_Properties:
      _Purpose: 'Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.'
      Properties _List:
        - Property_ID: MODAL-AUTO_CONFED-01
          Property_Name: ' Technological Anomaly (Alethic/Axiological Exception)'
          Description: >
            Its very existence as a functional , combat-capable automaton with a distinct
            (if outdated) pseudo-historical persona represents a rare intersection of Primal
             Mama's advanced biotech/solar capabilities (allowing its power source) and the
            mandated 197 0s aesthetic, while simultaneously embodying the societal taboo
            against advanced AI/robotics. It is "possible" but highly " disvalued."
          Limits: 'Its functionality is constrained by the 1970s tech (no true  AI, clunky mechanics). Its "value" is almost universally negative.'
          Authentication: '[Primal Mama Co herence Protocol: Alethic (Technological Aesthetic Constraint, Solar Dominance), Deontic (Automaton User St igma), Axiological (Autonomy vs. Automation).]' # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol]
      _Note : 'Its core being is an embodiment of several key Primal Mama modalities in tension.'


    6_Axiological_Properties :
      _Purpose: 'Define the character''s value status *within* Primal Mama.'
      Rep utation_Swamp_Dwellers: 'Authenticated as widely feared ("The Grey Ghost"). Some may see it as a protective spirit  if its patrol routes coincidentally ward off dangers, others as a curse. Stories of its implacability and resistance to harm  abound, likely exaggerated.' # Auth: [Folklore/Regional Belief (Hypothetical)]
      Reputation_Meat _Oligarchy_Beetriot: 'If known, authenticated as a dangerous piece of unregulated, rogue technology that  needs to be decommissioned. Symbol of lawlessness outside their control.' # Auth: [Deontic/Axi ological Implications]
      Moral_Alignment_Narrative_Framing: 'Authenticated as "Tragic Antagonist" or "Mis guided Obstacle." Its actions are driven by corrupted programming based on a forgotten, likely morally dubious, historical ideology, filtered through Pr imal Mama''s bizarre technological lens. It has no inherent morality.' # Auth: [Narrative Design]
      _A xiological_Undersaturation: >
        Value as salvageable parts (specific components might be prized for their
         retro-tech nature); any potential respect from fringe groups admiring its
        "rebellious" iconography (misinterpreted ).

    7_Historical_Properties:
      _Purpose: 'Define the character''s known origins and connections  to past events.'
      Origin: >
        Authenticated as a product of a short-lived, post-Calamity  attempt by a
        technologically adept but ideologically fringe group (perhaps calling themselves
        the "New Confederated  States of the Bayou" or similar) to create loyal enforcers.
        This group likely collapsed or was destroyed , leaving some units abandoned. Design
        explicitly evokes a romanticized/distorted image of Confederate soldiers, built
         with available 1970s-style tech. # Auth: [This Codex Entry - Inferred History] 
      Key_Past_Event_Connection_Programmed: 'Its programming contains corrupted references to "The Great War of  Reclamation" or "The Siege of Fort Reynolds" – entirely fictional conflicts within its creators'' deluded historical narrative, or  misremembered pre-Calamity events, now its primary operational context.' # Auth: [This Codex Entry -  Programmed Lore]
      Inherited_Ideals: 'Programmed with a garbled version of "Southern Honor," " State Sovereignty" (referring to a non-existent state), and "Defense of Tradition" (which it interprets  as defending its immediate, often nonsensical, territory and attacking anything "new" or "unauthorized").' # Auth : [This Codex Entry - Programmed Lore]
      _Historical_Undersaturation: >
        Specific names of its creators ; exact date of manufacture; the true fate of other
        "Grey Ghost" units; the precise details of its  "last stand" or mission that left
        it in its current state.

  Character_Constitution_Summary_and _Narrative_Function:
    _Purpose: 'Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from  the authenticated property bundle.'
    Core_Essence: >
      Unit 734 "Grey Ghost"  is constituted as a haunting anachronism within Primal Mama: a
      technologically constrained (1970 s aesthetic, limited AI) automaton embodying a
      warped and forgotten ideology. Its Physical form is a bizarre fusion of Confederate
       military iconography and retro-futuristic design. Its Functional properties make it
      a dangerous, albeit predictable, relic , powered by the world's advanced solar tech
      but limited by its crude construction and programming. Its Simulated Psychological
       state is one of unwavering, misguided "duty" to a dead cause, creating poignant or
      terrifying encounters. Social ly, it is an outcast, feared and misunderstood, a
      tangible representation of the societal stigma against automatons, despite  its lack
      of true sentience. It is a literal ghost in the machine, a piece of Primal Mama 's
      strange, layered history still stalking the bayous.
    Primary_Narrative_Function: > 
      Serves as a formidable regional antagonist or obstacle; a source of environmental
      storytelling revealing forgotten local histories/ ideologies; a physical manifestation
      of Primal Mama's core tension between advanced concepts (AI, solar power)  and imposed
      limitations (1970s aesthetic, social stigmas); a catalyst for characters to confront 
      themes of memory, obsolescence, and the dangers of blindly following outdated
      "programs." It can also  be a source of dark humor due to its anachronistic nature
      and misinterpretations.
    Key_Internal_ Conflicts_From_Bundle: >
      Outdated Programming vs. Current Reality (e.g., misidentifying  threats, defending
      meaningless locations); Conflicting/Corrupted Directives; Inability to self-repair
       or adapt beyond basic parameters leading to slow decay; Solar Dependency vs. Swamp
      Environment (limited sun, potential  for bio-battery sludge scarcity).
    Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle: >
      (Limited  for an automaton of this type) Could include: further degradation of
      systems leading to more erratic behavior; being "reprogrammed"  crudely by a
      desperate group (with unpredictable results); being dismantled for parts; or, in a
      more narrative -focused arc, a character finding a way to access its fragmented data
      logs to uncover a piece of lost local history.
