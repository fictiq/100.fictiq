  constitution_summary:
    core_essence: 'Jebediah Cletus is  constituted as a quintessential Lickskillet homesteader, a human embodiment of the struggle for self-reliance in the  Primal Mama world. His identity is forged by the swamp, his livelihood dependent on GE Alligators, and his toolkit firmly rooted in  the 1970s technological aesthetic. He is defined by his practical skills, his deep, albeit wary, connection  to the local environment (including its stranger elements like Swamp Witches), and his axiological commitment to independence and "honest work." His  existence is a constant negotiation with the world''s unique rules: the necessity of solar power, the prohibition on cattle,  the cultural weight of deified celebrities, and the ever-present "friction" from the meat oligarchy.'
     primary_narrative_function: "To represent the perspective and struggles of the 'common folk' in Lickskillet.  Acts as a source of local knowledge, historical context (post-calamity), and practical swamp wisdom. Can serve  as a quest-giver, a reluctant ally, or an obstacle whose traditionalism conflicts with protagonists' goals. His farm and life can  be a microcosm to explore Primal Mama's socio-economic and cultural dynamics (oligarchy vs. mom-and -pop, 1970s tech resilience, local beliefs)."
    key_internal_conflicts: "The  drive for independence vs. the crushing economic power of the meat oligarchy. Loyalty to traditional Lickskillet ways vs . the pragmatic need to adapt or adopt new (potentially distasteful) methods to survive. Suspicion of outsiders/new ideas vs.  the potential benefits they might offer. The value of hard-won personal knowledge vs. the perceived untrustworthiness of ' easy' automated systems (LLMs/Automatons)."
    potential_for_development: "Could be pushed to the brink by  the oligarchy, forcing him to make difficult choices (e.g.: form uneasy alliances, adopt forbidden practices, or lead  local resistance). Might learn new skills or gain new perspectives through interaction with Erpenthropes or more direct encounters with the  supernatural. Could become a mentor figure or a cautionary tale. His views on technology or outsiders could be challenged and potentially shift  based on narrative events."
