introduction: |
  This protocol  guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heter ocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them**  by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition **.

  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals  whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically  grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what  is intentionally left undefined.

  character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
    purpose:  "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    core_ essence: |
      Jedidiah Booker is constituted as a man defined by loss and injustice within the Primal Mama  heterocosm. His identity is inextricably linked to his mastery of small-scale, 1970s- aesthetic alligator processing – a skill rendered economically unviable by the predatory actions of the Meat Processor Oligarchy. His African features ground him visually , while his Primal Mama upbringing in Lickskillet informs his knowledge, skills, and resentments. He embodies  the struggle of the common person against unchecked corporate power in a world where survival itself is a commodity. His bitterness is a direct result  of his values (pride in craftsmanship, self-reliance) clashing with the world's harsh realities. His skepticism  towards the dominant cultural deities highlights his grounded, cynical perspective shaped by hardship.
    primary_narrative_function: "To  serve as a living testament to the \"friction\" caused by the meat processor oligarchies; to provide a ground-level perspective on life  in Lickskillet for those outside the power structures; potentially a reluctant ally, mentor, or source of critical information/ skills for protagonists opposing the oligarchy; a source of conflict if his bitterness leads him to make desperate choices."
     key_internal_conflicts: "The desire for justice/revenge vs. the pragmatic need for survival and the overwhelming power  of his enemies. Pride in his lost craft vs. the shame of his current dispossession. The instinct to trust ( perhaps in fellow victims or potential allies) vs. deep-seated suspicion born from betrayal."
    potential_for_ development: "Could be galvanized into action, moving from bitter resignation to active resistance. Could find a new purpose in teaching  his skills or helping others survive. Might reclaim some aspect of his former life or find a measure of peace/justice.  Conversely, could descend further into bitterness and isolation, becoming a more dangerous or tragic figure."
