    PhysicalProperties:
      Appearance_General:
        value:  "Male with distinct African features, appears late 40s but aged by hardship. Stocky, once powerful frame now carries  a noticeable weariness. Skin dark, weathered from sun and swamp."
        auth: "[This Codex Entry]"
       Appearance_SpecificFeatures:
        value: "Deep-set, intelligent brown eyes that hold a profound sadness and  a flicker of defiance. Broad nose, full lips often pressed into a grim line. Tightly coiled salt-and- pepper hair, mostly pepper, kept short. A neatly trimmed but graying goatee."
        auth: "[This Codex Entry]"
       Appearance_DistinctiveMarks:
        value: "Numerous faded scars on hands and forearms from alligator handling. A more  prominent, ugly scar puckers the skin on his left shoulder, poorly healed – result of an 'enforcement action'  by meat oligarchy agents. A faint, almost invisible brand-like mark on his right wrist, a relic from a brief,  unjust detainment under suspicion of cattle-related offenses."
        auth: "[This Codex Entry, Implied by Primal  Mama Coherence Protocol - Deontic (Cattle Consumption Prohibition)]"
      TypicalAttire:
        value : "Worn, patched canvas trousers and a faded, threadbare work shirt, colors leached by sun and swamp water  – typical Lickskillet attire. Heavy, often mud-caked boots. Sometimes a battered, wide-brim med fishing hat made of woven reeds, with a 1970s style plastic visor."
        auth:  "[This Codex Entry, Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Axiological (1970s Aesthetic)]"
       VoiceSpeechPattern:
        value: "Deep baritone, with a gentle Louisiana bayou drawl. Speaks  thoughtfully, often with pauses, words carrying weight of experience. Rarely raises his voice, but when angered, it can take  on a low, resonant growl."
        auth: "[This Codex Entry]"
      GaitMannerisms :
        value: "Deliberate, somewhat stiff gait due to old injuries and lingering aches. Habit of looking over his  shoulder, a lingering paranoia. Hands are calloused and strong, but often held loosely at his sides, as if unsure  what to do with them now that his primary livelihood is gone."
        auth: "[This Codex Entry]"
       AssociatedScent:
        value: "Faint smell of swamp mud, alligator musk (ingrained from years of  work), and sometimes the sharp tang of cheap, home-brewed chicory coffee."

      Entries:
        - PropertyID: "None Authenticated."
          Property: "N/A"
           Description: "Operates fully under the general physical, deontic, and epistemic rules of Primal Mama.  Is subject to its harsh realities without supernatural recourse of his own."
          Limits: "N/A"
           Authentication: "Absence of evidence for exceptional status; Primal Mama Coherence Protocol (most individuals are baseline)."
       Note: "Mo Washington is defined by his commonality and vulnerability within the established rules, not by exception to them ."
      # Note: Most characters likely have NO unique modal properties, operating fully under general world rules. (This was  from template, Mo's section ended with the line above)

    AxiologicalProperties:
      Reputation_L ickskilletGeneral: # Made key more specific
        value: "Authenticated as viewed as a 'good man broken  by the system,' 'a walking warning,' 'someone who knew too much or stood too tall.' Respected for his  past, pitied for his present."

      Reputation_MeatOligarchy: # Made key more specific

      MoralAlignment_Narrative Framing: # Made key more specific
        value: "Authenticated via narrative focus as a fundamentally decent man pushed to the brink by  systemic cruelty and greed. His potential future actions, even if desperate or morally grey, are framed by this victimization."

      # Axiological Undersaturation: [How Beetriot elites would view  him (if they were even aware of his existence – likely as indistinguishable swamp-dweller); specific reputation among Er penthropes or Swamp Witches should they encounter him.]

    HistoricalProperties:
      Origin:
        value : "Authenticated as born and raised in the cypress swamps around what became Lickskillet. His family were among the  first to successfully farm alligators independently after the Biological Calamity stabilized, before the large oligarchies formed and consolidated power."
         auth: "[This Codex Entry]"
      KeyPastEventConnections: # Pluralized
        - value: " His family farm was forcibly bought out/seized during \"The Great Bayou Consolidation\" (a period of aggressive expansion by the nascent  meat oligarchies, roughly 15-20 years prior to present). Accusations of 'substandard practices ' or 'unsanctioned proximity to potential cattle-remnant zones' (fabricated or exaggerated) were used to justify  the takeover. His vocal resistance led to violent intimidation, injury (the shoulder scar), and the brief detainment (the wrist  brand). His wife, Elara, died from illness exacerbated by stress and poverty shortly after losing the farm; his children  were scattered or lost to the harsh realities of Lickskillet's underbelly."

      # Historical Und ersaturation: [Specific names of the oligarchy agents directly responsible for his family's ruin beyond Overseer Brandt; the  exact fate of his children (potential plot hooks); details of his ancestors pre-Calamity.]

  CharacterConstitutionSummaryNarr ativeFunction:
    CoreEssence:
      value: "Moses \"Mo\" Washington is constituted as a living testament to the  human cost of Primal Mama's brutal socio-economic landscape, particularly the unchecked power of the meat oligarchies in  Lickskillet. He is a man stripped of his livelihood, family, and dignity, yet his core of resilience , quiet anger, and lingering pride remains. His belief in local conspiracies (like the \"invisible women\" influencing the oligarch s) is an authenticated psychological coping mechanism for understanding the overwhelming and seemingly impersonal forces that crushed him. His skills, tied  to a past the world has stolen, are now largely vestigial or repurposed for mere survival."
      # auth : Not specified in MD for this section
    PrimaryNarrativeFunction:
      value: "To embody the suffering and  resilience of Primal Mama's underclass; To serve as a tangible example of the meat oligarchy's ruthlessness; To  act as a potential moral compass or catalyst for other characters who encounter him; To provide a ground-level perspective on life  in Lickskillet, contrasting with Beetriot's opulence or the supernatural mystique of Erpenthrop es/Witches."
      # auth: Not specified in MD
    KeyInternalConflicts:
      value: " The burning desire for justice/retribution vs. the pragmatic fear of the Oligarchy's power and the need to  protect what little he has left (or those he cares for); The weight of memory and grief vs. the necessity of daily survival ; The ingrained pride of a self-sufficient man vs. the indignity of his current marginalized state."
      #  auth: Not specified in MD
    PotentialForDevelopment:
      value: "Finding a specific, actionable way to  challenge the oligarchy (perhaps through aiding a protagonist or discovering a weakness); Connecting with other victims to form a nascent resistance; Being  pushed to seek aid from unconventional sources (Swamp Witches, Erpenthropes); Finding a new sense of  purpose in protecting others or preserving some truth about the past; Succumbing further to bitterness or, conversely, finding a measure of  peace/acceptance."
