 introduction: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings)  within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond  this textual definition**.

  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted  individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are  logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge  what is intentionally left undefined.

      Appearance _General: '[e.g., Large, imposing human male, late 50s, with a fleshy face , carefully coiffed silver hair (often suspiciously dark at the roots), and a prominent gut straining against expensive, somewhat flashy 1 970s-style suits.] # Auth: [Primal Mama Visual Style Guide, Narrative Description]'
       Appearance_Specific_Features: '[e.g., Small, shrewd eyes that miss little, a smile that rarely reaches them,  jowly cheeks. Often seen with a slight sheen of perspiration under bright lights or during impassioned speeches.] # Auth : [Narrative Description]'

      Voice_Speech_Pattern : '[e.g., Booming, practiced baritone with a thick, syrupy Southern drawl that can turn  sharp and menacing in private.

    historical_properties:
       purpose: 'Define the character''s known origins and connections to past events.'
      Origin: '[e. g., Authenticated as rising through Beetriot''s political machine over decades, initially perhaps as a charismatic lawyer or city  councilman, ruthlessly eliminating rivals and forging alliances with the burgeoning meat oligarchy. Likely pre-dates the full de ification of the celebrity trio but instrumental in codifying their veneration for social cohesion and his own political gain.] # Auth: [ Narrative Backstory Elements, Logical progression in Primal Mama timeline]'
      Key_Past_Event_Connection: '[e. g., Heavily involved in the formal legislation that cemented cattle as elite artifacts and criminalized their consumption, spinning it as " preserving our heritage" while ensuring a controllable, alligator-dependent food supply. Oversaw the "Great Beetriot Beautification Project " which strictly enforced the 1970s tech aesthetic across all new construction and public works, ostensibly for "civ ic pride" but actually to stifle unapproved innovation and maintain a familiar, controllable environment.] # Auth: [Primal  Mama Coherence Protocol - Historical links to current state]'
      Inherited_Items_Positions: '[e.g., The  Mayorship of Beetriot itself, with all its attendant powers and resources. A vast network of political debts and favors.  Several prime cattle-artifact specimens acquired through "gifts" or dubious means.] # Auth: [Narrative inventory]'
      historical _undersaturation: '[e.g., Specific details of his early life before politics, the exact nature of his first big  ''break'' or most ruthless early acts, any genuine mentors or early positive influences (likely few or none remaining). The  precise moment he ''sold his soul'' to the oligarchy.]'

  character_constitution_summary_narrative _function:
    purpose: 'Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.' 
    Core_Essence: 'Mayor Rex "Kingfish" Beauregard is constituted as the personification of Beet riot''s decadent, controlled, and corrupt power structure. He is a charismatic demagogue who masterfully manipulates Pr imal Mama''s unique cultural fabric—the cattle taboo, the 1970s aesthetic, the deified celebrities , and the alligator-based economy—to maintain his iron grip on the city and enrich himself and his oligarchic allies . His entire being is a performance, masking a core of narcissistic greed and paranoid ruthlessness. He represents the societal sickness that thrives by  exploiting the very laws and values it purports to uphold, particularly the Alethic impossibility/Deontic prohibition of  cattle consumption and the Axiological reverence for a manufactured past.'
    Primary_Narrative_Function: 'To serve as a primary  antagonist, representing systemic corruption and oppression within Beetriot. He is an obstacle to protagonists seeking truth, justice, or freedom  from the city''s constraints. He embodies the oppressive side of Primal Mama''s retro-futuristic, bayou-infused  dystopia, particularly the "friction" caused by the meat oligarchy he enables.'
    Key_Internal_Conflicts _From_Bundle: 'The constant effort to maintain his folksy public persona versus his private tyrannical nature. His fear of exposure or  being overthrown by rivals or popular unrest (perhaps fueled by Erpenthrope revelations or Lickskillet defiance). His dependence on  the meat oligarchy, which could turn on him if he ceases to be useful or becomes too much of a liability.  The potential for the "invisible women" conspiracy he might manipulate to spin out of his control.'
    Potential_for_Development _Based_on_Bundle: 'His downfall is the most narratively potent development. This could come through exposure of his  corruption, a successful challenge by protagonists, betrayal by the oligarchy, or the consequences of his own hubris. Minor developments could include  increasing paranoia, more desperate measures to cling to power, or even a (highly unlikely) moment of forced reflection if faced with undeniable  truth or personal loss. His adherence to the 1970s aesthetic could become a weakness if new, uncontrollable  tech emerges.'
