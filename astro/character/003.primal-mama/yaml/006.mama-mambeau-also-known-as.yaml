introduction: >
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fict ional Persons**
  (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama
  heterocosm. Following Dole Å¾el's framework, characters **ARE**
  constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them**
   by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives).
  They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond  this textual
  definition**.

  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly
  authenticating their properties across  relevant categories. Focus
  on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from
  the **richness, coherence, and  potential tensions within their
  authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded
  in their defined nature and the world 's rules. Remember
  **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what
  is intentionally left undefined.

 character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
  purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts,  and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.
  core_essence: >
    Mama Mambeau is  constituted as an embodiment of the Primal Mama
    swamp's ancient, amoral, and mystical undercurrents.  She is a
    living repository of Cthulhu-goth-Southern esoteric knowledge,
    existing outside  and often in defiance of Beetriot's
    retro-futuristic order and the deified celebrity cults. Her power 
    is derived from the swamp itself, making her intrinsically tied
    to its health and its secrets. She represents the unt amable,
    the primal, and the weird spiritual miasma that permeates the
    world, a direct counterpoint to the  engineered and propagandized
    aspects of Primal Mama society.
  primary_narrative_function: > 
    Oracle/Source of forbidden knowledge; Gatekeeper to deeper swamp
    mysteries; Potential uneasy ally or formidable  obstacle;
    Embodiment of the world's "Cthulhu-goth-Southern" spiritual
     dimension; Catalyst for characters confronting the unnatural or
    seeking solutions beyond conventional means; Possible antagonist
    if her " balance" conflicts with protagonists' goals.
  key_internal_conflicts_from_bundle: >
    The burden  of ancient, often terrifying, knowledge vs. the
    encroachment of the "new" world; Her deep  connection to the
    amoral swamp vs. residual human empathy (if any); The need
    for isolation to  maintain her power vs. the occasional
    necessity of interacting with the very people she distrusts.
  potential _for_development_based_on_bundle: >
    Revealing critical, hidden lore about the Biological Calamity
     or the true nature of Erpenthropes; Being forced into an
    alliance against a common threat to  the swamp; Her powers
    waning or growing in response to world events; Confronting a
    novel magical or technological  threat that challenges her
    ancient ways.
