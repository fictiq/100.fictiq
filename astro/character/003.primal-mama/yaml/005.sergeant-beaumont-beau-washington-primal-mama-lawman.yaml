introduction: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fict ional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's  framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this  Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.

  Use this template to systematically build characters  by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness,  coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world' s rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

  purpose: "Synthesize the core identity , internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
  core_essence: |
    Ser geant Beau Washington is constituted as a deeply rooted, pragmatic lawman of Lickskillet Parish, embodying the everyday struggle  to maintain order and justice in the uniquely strange and often contradictory world of Primal Mama. His existence is defined by his  functional competence within the swamp environment, his adherence to a 1970s-era law enforcement methodology, and  his psychological weariness tempered by an enduring, localized sense of duty. He navigates the complex social web of a town dominated  by the alligator economy and overshadowed by powerful, distant oligarchs, all while contending with the tangible reality of ghosts, Er penthropes, and Swamp Witchery. His adherence to the cattle consumption taboo is absolute, a cornerstone of his understanding of the  post-calamity world order.
  primary_narrative_function: |
    Serves as a key  local authority figure and potential grounding influence for protagonists. He can act as an information source, an ally against more overt threats, an  obstacle if protagonists operate outside his legal/moral boundaries, or a representation of the "common man's" perspective on  Primal Mama's oddities. He embodies the tension between local needs and external pressures (Oligarchy), and between  mundane law and supernatural realities.
  key_internal_conflicts: |
    The obligation to enforce all laws vs . empathy for struggling locals exploited by those same laws (via Oligarchy influence). His innate pragmatism and desire for tangible  results vs. the often inexplicable or untouchable nature of supernatural events or high-level corruption. The temptation of cynicism and retirement vs . his ingrained sense of responsibility to his community.
  potential_for_development: |
    Could be forced  to confront the limits of his authority when facing significant Oligarchy overreach or a major supernatural crisis. Might learn to collaborate  more closely with unconventional allies (Erpenthropes, certain Witches) if faced with a threat neither can handle alone.  Could uncover unsettling truths about local history or the powers that be, pushing his loyalty and pragmatism to their limits. His views  on Automaton/LLM users might be challenged if one proves vital to solving a critical case.
