Character_Constitution_Summary_And_Narrative_Function: # Changed '& ' to 'And' for simpler key
  _Purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging  from the authenticated property bundle."
  Core_Essence: "Ambassador Evelyn Thorne is constituted as a quintessential agent  of Beetriot's ordered, retro-futuristic society. Her being is a performance of competence, adherence to the  1970s aesthetic, and propagation of Beetriot's influence. She embodies the tension between manufactured order and the organic , often inexplicable, realities of the Primal Mama swamplands. Her professionalism is both her strength and her potential blind spot when  encountering phenomena outside Beetriot's established epistemic framework (e.g., genuine supernatural occurrences, the depth of local  belief systems like the \"invisible women\" conspiracy or the power of deified celebrities)."
  Primary_Narrative_ Function: "To serve as a viewpoint character representing Beetriot's perspective and interests, often clashing with or being challenged by the  \"truths\" of the swamp. She can act as an instigator of conflict (enforcing unpopular Beetriot policies),  a problem-solver (mediating disputes), or an investigator whose official methods are tested by the world's peculiarities. Her presence  highlights the cultural and ideological rifts within Primal Mama, particularly concerning technology (solar/GE vs. 197 0s aesthetic, Automaton stigma) and belief (official narratives vs. folk knowledge/supernatural)."
  Key _Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: "Maintaining Beetriot's ideals vs. the pragmatic realities of the swamp . Skepticism of the supernatural/folkloric vs. potentially undeniable encounters. Adherence to the restrictive 19 70s technological and social norms vs. the allure or utility of forbidden knowledge/practices. Professional ambition vs. personal ethical  dilemmas arising from Beetriot's policies or swamp realities."
  Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle : |
    Thorne could undergo significant development through prolonged exposure to the swamp. She might:
    - Gain a grud ging respect for swamp ingenuity or certain "supernatural" elements (Epistemic/Axiological shift).
    -  Have her loyalty to Beetriot tested by uncovering inconvenient truths (Psychological/Social shift).
    - Be forced to adapt  her methods, perhaps even cautiously bending Beetriot's rigid rules (Functional/Deontic shift).
    - Become  more deeply entrenched in her Beetriot worldview, viewing the swamp with increasing disdain or fear.
