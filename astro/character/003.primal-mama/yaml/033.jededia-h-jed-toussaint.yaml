       appearance_general:
        value: "Human male, mid-40s, with pronounced African facial features – broad nose , full lips. Once powerfully built from swamp work, now gaunt and perpetually hunched, radiating weariness."
         auth_source: "This Codex"

        value: "Deep- set, haunted dark eyes that rarely meet another's gaze directly. Skin is a rich brown, but ashen around the mouth and  eyes from stress and malnutrition. Hair is short, tightly coiled, and prematurely flecked with grey, often matted with swamp  detritus."
        auth_source: "This Codex"
      appearance_distinctive_marks:
         value: "The thumb and first two fingers of his left hand are missing, replaced by ragged scar tissue – a stark reminder of  an \"enforcement action\" by oligarchy thugs or a desperate escape. A faded, intricate geometric tattoo, reminiscent of West African motifs , is partially visible on his right forearm when his sleeve is pushed up."
        auth_source: "This Codex" 
      typical_attire:
        value: "Filthy, torn canvas trousers, once dyed a deep indigo , now faded to murky brown. A threadbare, patched-up burlap shirt. Often barefoot, or with remnants of  hide-wrapped foot coverings. Constantly shivers, even in the bayou heat."

      voice_speech_pattern:
        value : "Voice is low, hoarse, and often breaks into a coughing fit. Speaks in short, hesitant phrases, sometimes  mumbling incoherently. Carries a distinct Lickskillet drawl, but fear has clipped his expressiveness."

      gait_manner isms:
        value: "Moves with a furtive, skittish gait, always scanning his surroundings for threats. Flin ches at loud noises or sudden movements. Constantly wrings his remaining right hand or touches the stump of his left."
         auth_source: "This Codex - Embodiment of fear and trauma"
      associated_scent:
         value: "Overpowering scent of stale swamp water, mud, unwashed body, and a faint, lingering metallic tang of  old blood or fear-sweat."

         value: "Haunted by vivid, recurring memories of his life before the event that destroyed it – the smell of his  cook-fire, the sounds of his family (if he had one), the feel of a successful hunt.

    ax iological_properties:
      reputation_lickskillet_populace:
        value: "Authenticated as viewed with ' fear', 'pity (from a safe distance)', 'a cautionary tale'. His story is whispered to discourage defiance against the meat processors . Some may secretly believe his innocence but are too terrified to offer aid."

      reputation_meat_oligarchy_enforcers:
        value:  "Authenticated as 'dangerous nuisance', 'escaped criminal', 'property violator' (if accused of poaching or cattle-related crimes ). His capture might carry a small bounty. He is considered disposable."
        auth_source: "Oligarchy's perspective "
      moral_alignment_narrative_framing:
        value: "Authenticated via his internal state and backstory  as an 'innocent man wronged', a 'victim of systemic injustice'. His current desperate actions are framed by survival needs,  not malice."
        auth_source: "This Codex – establishing his victimhood for narrative purposes"
      axiological_ undersaturation: "How Beetriot citizens would view him (likely not at all, too insignificant); perception by Erpenthropes  or Swamp Witches (if they were ever to encounter him, likely indifference unless he trespassed)."

      key_past_event_connection_personal:
        value : "The \"Incident\" – Authenticated as being falsely accused and brutally punished for either: a) possession/intent to distribute  cattle meat (a convenient frame-up by the oligarchy to seize his productive trapping grounds or eliminate a mildly outspoken small  competitor), OR b) sabotage against a major meat processing plant (another frame-up). This event involved the loss of his  fingers, his business, his home, and likely his family."
        auth_source: "This Codex - Core of his victim hood, tied to Primal Mama's deontic/alethic rules"
      inherited_items:
         value: "None remain. Everything was confiscated or destroyed. He might carry a single, small, hidden memento  from his past life – perhaps a smooth river stone his child gave him, or a tattered piece of his wife's  shawl – that he guards fiercely."
        auth_source: "This Codex - Symbol of his loss"
      historical_unders aturation: "Specific details of his ancestors; precise timeline of his life pre-Incident beyond generalities; the exact names and fates  of all his family members beyond 'lost'."

  character_constitution_summary:
    core_essence: | 
      Jedediah Toussaint is constituted as a living embodiment of the brutal consequences of Primal Mama's  socio-economic and legal order, particularly the oppressive power of the meat oligarchy and the absolute terror of the cattle consumption taboo.  His Physical deterioration, Functional incapacitation, and Psychological brokenness are direct results of his unjust victimization. He is a man stripped  of his Social standing, his History (in terms of a future), and any positive Axiological value within his community, now  existing purely in a state of reactive survival. His African features and deep swamp roots ground him authentically within the diverse tapestry of Pr imal Mama's Lickskillet, making his tragedy more specific and impactful.
    primary_narrative_ function: |
      To serve as a stark illustration of the stakes and injustices within Primal Mama; to act as a catalyst  or object of pity/concern for a protagonist; to highlight the cruelty of the meat oligarchy and the pervasive fear that underpins  Lickskillet society. He can represent the "forgotten victims" of the established order. His potential belief in conspiracies  like the "invisible women" could also showcase how ordinary people try to make sense of systemic oppression they cannot otherwise explain.
    key _internal_conflicts: |
      The primal urge to survive vs. soul-crushing despair; Fading memories of love  and dignity vs. the brutalizing reality of his present; A desperate, suppressed desire for justice/explanation vs. overwhelming , paralyzing fear.
    potential_for_development: |
      While deeply traumatized, potential exists for: a  flicker of defiance if pushed to an absolute limit; finding an unexpected, hidden ally; sharing his story (if he can overcome his fear ) to expose injustice; succumbing entirely to madness or despair; or finding a small, tragic moment of peace or self-sacrifice.  His development is less about regaining what was lost (which seems impossible) and more about how he faces his brokenness.
