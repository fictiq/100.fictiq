Introduction_Fictional_Persons_Constitution: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of Fictional Persons ( characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters ARE  constituted by the bundle of properties authenticated for them by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess no independent  psyche or reality beyond this textual definition.
  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle, and whose actions are logically  grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember undersaturation: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.

      Associated_Scent_If_Any :
        value: "Faint, expensive (by Primal Mama standards) synthetic musk cologne, a touch of ozone  from personal tech, and the sterile scent of Beetriot's filtered air clinging to his clothes."

        value: "Clear memories of Beetriot life, political training, previous  (less hazardous) assignments. Understands the official narrative of the Biological Calamity. Publicly reveres Reynolds, Reed, and  Parsons as cultural icons, but privately may view them as useful societal constructs."
        auth: "[Epistemic Rules : Calamity Narrative, Celebrity Deities]"

      Note: "Most characters likely have NO unique modal properties,  operating fully under general world rules. Ambassador Thorne possesses no personal supernatural abilities or exemptions from Primal Mama's core laws (e .g., he cannot eat beef, he cannot naturally transform).

         value: "Seen as the \"Man from the City\" – potentially arrogant, untrustworthy, but also a vital  link to Beetriot's resources, technology (within the 70s aesthetic), and market for their alligator products. A  necessary evil, or a dangerous temptation."

       Reputation_Erpenthropes_If_Known:
        value: "Likely viewed with suspicion  as an agent of a complex, potentially deceitful human society; his pursuit of Beetriot's goals might clash with their  pursuit of \"truth\"."
        auth: "[Axiological Value: Truth (Erpenthropes)] "
      Moral_Alignment_Narrative_Framing:
        value: "Lawful Neutral (prioritizes Beet riot's order and laws, and his mission, above individual concerns or abstract morality) to Lawful Evil (if  Beetriot's aims are oppressive and he willingly enforces them)."

      Key_Past_Event_ Connection:
        value: "Likely has studied the official, sanitized history of the Biological Calamity and the subsequent rise  of the Alligator Biogenesis and Solar Dominance. Understands the *legal and cultural basis* for the Cattle Consumption Prohibition and cattle  as artifacts, even if he doesn't know all the hidden truths."
        auth: "[Epistemic Rules , Alethic Rules]"
      Inherited_Items_Status:
        value: "His position and access  are inherited from Beetriot's societal structure. May possess a family heirloom that conforms to the 1970 s aesthetic (e.g., a chunky signet ring, a vintage (for them) fountain pen with wood paneling )."
        auth: "[Tech Aesthetic, Character Concept]"
      Undersaturation_Notes: "[Specifics of his family background  beyond \"elite\"; details of his training or previous diplomatic successes/failures that shaped him; any personal connection to the \"invisible women\"  conspiracy beyond general societal awareness.]"

  Character_Constitution_Summary_And_Narrative_Function:
     Purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    Core_Ess ence: "Ambassador Sterling Thorne is constituted as a quintessential agent of Beetriot's \"civilized\" retro-futurism , a man whose sophisticated 1970s veneer and pragmatic ambition are constantly tested by the primal, spiritually-infused, and  often bizarre realities of the wider Primal Mama world. He embodies the tension between urban control and swamp wildness, advanced  (bio/solar) tech filtered through an analog aesthetic, and official narratives versus unsettling truths. His adherence to Beetriot's De ontic (e.g., Automaton stigma) and Axiological (1970s style as peak)  rules defines his interactions and limitations."
    Primary_Narrative_Function: "To act as a bridge or antagonist  representing Beetriot's interests in the swamp; to drive plots involving negotiation, resource conflict, or urban encroachment on swamp territories /cultures; to provide an outsider's (albeit a biased one) perspective on the swamp's denizens ( Erpenthropes, Witches, Lickskillet folk); to highlight the cultural and technological clashes within Primal Mama ."
    Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: "Maintaining composure/control vs. visceral reactions to swamp  phenomena; loyalty to Beetriot's potentially sterile order vs. the strange vitality of the swamp; personal ambition vs.  the genuine dangers of his post; the official Beetriot understanding of the world vs. contradictory evidence he might encounter (e.g ., from Erpenthropes or ghosts)."
    Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle: "Could  be \"corrupted\" or \"enlightened\" by prolonged exposure to the swamp, potentially questioning Beetriot's dogma  (Psychological/Epistemic shift). Might forge unexpected, genuine alliances (Social/Relational change). Could be forced to adapt  his methods, becoming more ruthless or more empathetic (Functional/Psychological change). His understanding of the \"incredible source of energy \" (solar) or alligator biogenesis might deepen or be challenged."
