introduction: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition  of Fictional Persons (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters ARE constituted by the bundle of properties authenticated for them by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They  possess no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition.
  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across  relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember undersaturation: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.

  character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
    purpose: "Synthesize the core identity , internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    core_essence: |
      Bo " Gatorbait" Culpepper is constituted as a quintessential Lickskillet survivor, embodying the gritty resilience, ingrained suspicion, and  fierce independence of those living on the fringes of Primal Mama's strange society. His existence is a constant struggle against  the encroaching meat oligarchy, powered by jury-rigged 1970s solar tech and a deep-seated  belief in self-reliance, local traditions (including celebrity reverence and conspiracy theories), and the absolute taboo of cattle consumption. He is  a man defined by his environment: the swamp, the GE alligators he processes, and the socio-economic pressures of a world rebuilt  on bizarre foundations.
    primary_narrative_function: |
      To serve as a viewpoint character for life in Lick skillet, illustrating the daily realities and struggles of independent operators. He can act as a source of local knowledge, a  reluctant ally or obstacle for protagonists, and a tangible representation of the "friction" caused by the meat oligarchy. His  adherence to the 1970s aesthetic and local beliefs grounds these world elements in a lived experience.
     key_internal_conflicts:
      - 'Stubborn Pride vs. Practical Need for Survival (e.g., dealing  with oligarchy)'
      - 'Traditional Methods vs. Pressure to Modernize (within 1970s  tech limits)'
      - 'Suspicion of Outsiders vs. Potential Need for Help'
      - 'Folk Belief s/Conspiracies vs. Harsh Realities.'
    potential_for_development: |
      Bo could  be pushed to the brink by the oligarchy, forcing him to either make a desperate stand (perhaps rallying other small operators), seek  unconventional allies (even those he distrusts, like someone with 'stigma' tech or even contact with fringe elements like Witches /Erpenthropes if desperate enough), or be forced to sell out/adapt in a way that compromises his core  values. Discovery of information that challenges his conspiracy beliefs or offers a true path to resistance could also drive change.
