introduction: >
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters,  significant sentient beings)
  within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters ** ARE** constituted by the
  **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex,  core narratives).
  They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.


  Use this template to  systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across
  relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the ** richness,
  coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically
  grounded in  their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is
  essential, acknowledge what  is intentionally left undefined.

      properties:
        - 'Appearance_General: [Human  male, early 40s, meticulously maintained physique that suggests regular, controlled exercise rather than physical labor. Carries himself with  an air of urban sophistication that seems slightly out of place in swampier environs.] # Auth: [Primal Mama Visual Guide  Concept]'
        - 'Appearance_Specific Features: [Sharp, analytical features; eyes are a cool, assessing grey. Hair  is perfectly coiffed in a somewhat feathered, yet conservative, late 1970s style. Fingernails are  always clean.] # Auth: [Primal Mama Visual Guide Concept]'
        - 'Appearance_Distinctive Marks:  [None visible; prides himself on an unblemished, "civilized" presentation.] # Auth: [Character Concept]' 
        - 'Typical Attire: [Impeccably tailored leisure suits or diplomatic ensembles in muted earth tones (och re, olive, brown) made from high-quality synthetic fabrics – all strictly adhering to late 1970s Beet riot elite fashion. Polished, low-heeled dress shoes (often impractical for muddy terrain). Occasionally wears a wide- lapeled, weather-resistant trench coat when traveling by watercraft.] # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Tech  Aesthetic Constraint / Visual Guide]'
        - 'Voice/Speech Pattern: [Cultivated, smooth baritone. Speaks with precise diction  and carefully chosen words, often with a slight air of condescension or patient explanation, especially when addressing those he perceives as less sophisticated . Avoids slang or regional dialects.] # Auth: [Character Concept Dialogue Notes]'
        - 'Gait/ Mannerisms: [Controlled, deliberate movements. Tends to stand stiffly in less "orderly" environments.  Subtle habit of adjusting his cuffs or smoothing his lapels. Uses a datapad with a chunky, wood-paneled casing  and analog-style readouts.] # Auth: [Character Concept / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic Constraint ]'
        - 'Associated Scent (If Any): [Faint, lingering scent of an expensive, somewhat mus ky 1970s-style cologne and the slightly sterile smell of Beetriot''s filtered air systems.] #  Auth: [Sensory Palette - Beetriot vs. Swamp]'
      undersaturation: '# Physical Undersaturation:  [Exact height/weight, specific brand of cologne, preference for tea or coffee (though likely something refined and imported to  Beetriot, if available).]'

        - 'Limitation (Knowledge): [Ignorant of practical swamp survival, local  Lickskillet customs beyond superficial briefings, Erpenthrope lore, practical magic, or the true nature of Swamp  Witch abilities.

        - 'Limitation (Social):  [Struggles to connect authentically with non-Beetriot citizens. His adherence to formality can be perceived as arrogance or unt rustworthiness.

   character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
    purpose: 'Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.'
    core_essence: >
      Ambassador Sterling Thorne is constituted  as the quintessential Beetriot elite: a man whose identity is
      inextricably linked to the city's artificial order,  its mandated 1970s retro-futuristic aesthetic,
      its reliance on solar power and GE alligators, and  its rigid social hierarchies. He is a product of a
      system that values surface and control over substance and authenticity, where  cattle are art and their
      consumption an unthinkable horror. His entire being reflects Beetriot's attempt to impose a  specific,
      controlled reality onto the chaotic aftermath of the Biological Calamity.
    primary_narrative_ function: >
      To serve as an embodiment of Beetriot's culture, power, and worldview when interacting with the " outer"
      territories like Lickskillet. He can act as an antagonist, a source of conflict due  to cultural
      misunderstandings or policy enforcement, a vehicle for exposition about Beetriot, or potentially a
      character whose  rigid beliefs are challenged by the realities of the swamp and its denizens (Erpenthropes,
      W itches, the resilience of mom-and-pop operations). He highlights the socio-economic friction caused by
      entities  like the meat oligarchy, for whom he might be an unwitting (or witting) agent.
    key_ internal_conflicts:
      'description': >
        The core conflict lies between Thorne's ingrained Beetriot exceptional ism/fastidiousness and the
        unavoidable grit, danger, and alien logic of the Primal Mama sw amplands. This manifests as:
      conflicts:
        - 'Adherence to protocol vs. the need for unorthodox  solutions in the swamp.'
        - 'Belief in Beetriot''s "truth" vs. contradictory evidence encountered  outside.'
        - 'Personal ambition vs. the genuine (and perhaps unpleasant) demands of his mission.'
         - 'Disdain for Automaton/LLM users vs. potential situations where such tools might be (perversely)  useful but reputationally disastrous.'
    potential_for_development:
      'description': >
        Thorne 's authenticated properties allow for several development paths:
      paths:
        - 'He could become more entrenched in his Beet riot views, becoming a more rigid antagonist.'
        - 'He might develop a grudging respect for certain aspects of swamp  life or certain individuals, leading to a slight moderation of his elitism (Social/Psychological change).'
        - ' A direct, undeniable encounter with the supernatural (Erpenthropes, potent magic) could shatter or reshape his Ep istemic framework.'
        - 'Failure in his mission could lead to disgrace in Beetriot (Social/Axiological change),  potentially forcing him into an unwelcome alliance or exile.'
        - 'He might be forced to confront the "truth"  sought by Erpenthropes, challenging his understanding of the Calamity or Beetriot''s foundations (Ep istemic/Psychological shift).'
