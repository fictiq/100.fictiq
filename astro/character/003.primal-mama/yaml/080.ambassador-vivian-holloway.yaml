introduction :
  title: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually
  text: >
    This protocol guides the detailed definition  of **Fictional Persons**
    (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama
    heterocosm . Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE**
    constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them **
    by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives).
    They possess **no independent psyche or  reality beyond this textual definition**.


    Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly
    authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on
    creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the
    **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle **,
    and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and
    the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**:  define what is essential,
    acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

character_constitution_ summary:
  purpose: 'Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.'
   core_essence: >
    Ambassador Vivian Holloway is constituted as a quintessential Beetriot elite,
    embodying  its values of order, technological sophistication (within the 1970s
    aesthetic), and reliance on the structured  exploitation of the swamp's resources.
    Her Physical polish and Functional capabilities in diplomacy are a direct
    product of her  upbringing and training. Psychologically, she is pragmatic and
    controlled, driven by a belief in Beetriot's  civilizing mission, though this
    creates an internal conflict when confronted with the raw, often ethically
    murky,  realities of Lickskillet and the powerful, self-serving Meat Oligarchs.
    Her Social position grants her authority  but also isolates her from the very
    people she needs to understand and influence.
  primary_narrative_function: > 
    To act as a key interface and point of friction between the "civilized"
    urban center of Beetriot and the  "primal" resource-rich swamplands of Lickskillet.
    She can be a quest-giver,  an obstacle, a source of information (filtered
    through Beetriot's lens), or a potential ally/target depending on protagonist 
    goals. She embodies the themes of colonialism/neo-colonialism (Beetriot's
    dependence  on and control over Lickskillet), order vs. chaos, and the
    compromises of power.
  key _internal_conflicts: >
    'Beetriot idealism/order vs. Lickskillet pragmatism/chaos;  Adherence to
    diplomatic protocol vs. the need for unconventional solutions to deal with
    oligarchs or  swamp mysteries; Personal distaste/discomfort with the swamp vs.
    professional necessity; Duty to Beetriot vs. nascent empathy or  understanding
    for Lickskillet''s plight (potential development).'
  potential_for_development: > 
    Her views on Lickskillet and its people could evolve through prolonged exposure.
    She might be forced  to make difficult ethical choices that challenge her
    Beetriot conditioning. She could become more deeply entangled with the Meat
    O ligarchs (either as an opponent or a compromised pawn). Her official
    skepticism regarding the supernatural elements of  Primal Mama (Erpenthropes,
    ghosts, Swamp Witches) could be shattered by direct  experience, forcing a
    re-evaluation of her worldview. She might uncover inconvenient truths about
    Beetriot 's history or its true relationship with the calamity.
