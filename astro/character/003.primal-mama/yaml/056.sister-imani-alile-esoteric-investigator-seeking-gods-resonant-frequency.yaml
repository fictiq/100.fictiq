introduction:
  title: "Con stituting Fictional Persons Textually"
  text: "This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional  Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex , core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.\n\nUse this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the  **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined."

      ability_heightened_sensitivity_numinous_pres ences:
        value: "Heightened Sensitivity to Numinous Presences: Through her experiments and self-developed techniques, she  can perceive subtle shifts in spiritual ambiance, often experiencing them as auditory hallucinations (faint choirs, static whispers, deep hum s) or visual distortions at the periphery of her vision. This is not as innate or powerful as an Erpenth rope's abilities but is beyond baseline human."
        auth: This Codex Entry
      limitation_knowledge:
        value : "Lacks formal training in advanced genetic engineering or solar energy science (beyond what's publicly known or inferable ). Her \"scientific\" methods for spiritual investigation are highly unorthodox and self-taught, often blending folk magic with repurposed analog tech."

      property_modal_ima_01:
        id: MODAL-IMA- 01
        property_name: "Cultivated Numinous Resonance (Epistemic/Alethic Exception)" 
        description: "Through sustained, unique ritualistic practices and use of her self-designed analog sensory devices, Imani  has achieved a heightened, albeit unstable, perception of and interaction with subtle spiritual energies and entities beyond standard ghost ritual efficacy. She can  occasionally 'tune into' or provoke responses from phenomena not typically accessible."
        limits: "Perception is often ambiguous , heavily reliant on her subjective interpretation and the function of her temperamental 1970s-tech equipment. Can  cause mental strain, physical exhaustion, or attract unwanted spectral attention. Does not grant overt supernatural powers like Erpenthrope  transformation or Swamp Witch magic."
        authentication: "Demonstrated via narrative portrayal of her experiments yielding unusual results distinct from  standard ghost interactions; her unique equipment behaving in ways that suggest detection of non-standard phenomena."
      note: " This property is cultivated and learned, not innate like an Erpenthrope's, but pushes the boundaries of authenticated  human potential for spiritual interaction in Primal Mama."

    axiological_properties:

      reputation_lickskillet_locals:
        value:  "Authenticated as viewed as 'the God-Seeker Woman', 'Sister Spooky-Sounds', 'either touched by spirits or plain  touched'. Generally harmless, but best not to get too involved in her 'experiments'. Some seek her out for folk wisdom or dream  interpretation."
        auth: This Codex Entry
      reputation_swamp_witches:
        value:  "Authenticated as viewed as potentially 'a fellow traveler on a different path', 'one who listens to the wrong whispers but listens nonetheless ', or 'dangerously naive in her tinkering'."
        auth: "This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol  - Swamp Witch Lore"
      reputation_celebrity_deity_clergy_devotees:
         value: "Authenticated as viewed as 'heretical', 'blasphemous for questioning the Divine Trio', ' a purveyor of dangerous spiritual alternatives'."
        auth: "This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol -  Deified Celebrities Values"
      moral_alignment_narrative_framing:
        value: "Authenticated  via narrative focus as a sincere, if eccentric, seeker of profound truth, driven by a deep spiritual yearning rather than malice or self- aggrandizement. Her methods are unconventional but not inherently evil."
        auth: This Codex Entry
      ax iological_undersaturation: "Reputation among Erpenthropes; views of the Beetriot elite (likely unaware or dismissive ); reputation among those who believe in the \"invisible women\" conspiracy."

    historical_properties:
      purpose:  "Define the character's known origins and connections to past events."
      origin:
        value: "Authenticated  as originating from a small, now-vanished deep-bayou community that held onto syncretic spiritual beliefs blending  pre-calamity African diasporic traditions with post-calamity swamp mysticism. Her drive is partly to  understand/validate these inherited beliefs through her own 'scientific-spiritual' lens."
        auth: This Codex Entry
       key_past_event_connection_subjective:
        value: "A childhood event where her isolated community  experienced a powerful, unexplainable 'visitation' or manifestation, which decimated some but left Imani with a profound sense  of questioning and a feeling of being 'marked' or 'called' to understand."
        auth: This Codex Entry 
      inherited_items:
        value: "Authenticated to possess a few heavily weathered, hand-copied notebooks from her community' s elders, containing fragmented rituals, cosmological observations, and herbal lore written in a creolized script. Also, a non- functional but symbolic 'spirit box' – a 1970s transistor radio her grandfather tried to use for divination ."
        auth: "This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - 1970s Tech  Aesthetic"
      historical_undersaturation: "Precise details of her vanished community; specific nature of the 'visitation'; full  content of the inherited notebooks."

  character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
    purpose: " Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    core_essence : "Sister Imani Alile is constituted as a unique figure in Primal Mama: a spiritual seeker whose African heritage and inherited  swamp mysticism are filtered through a lens of quasi-scientific inquiry, all constrained and flavored by the world's 1 970s technological aesthetic. She is a 'rogue theologian' attempting to empirically validate the existence of a 'Pr imal Divine Source' beyond the deified celebrities, using ritual, self-made analog devices, and deep environmental listening. Her ' experiments' are a testament to human ingenuity and spiritual yearning in a world where the veil is thin and technology serves unusual masters. She  embodies the search for authentic meaning amidst the bizarre, retro-futuristic, and spiritually charged miasma of Primal Mama."
     primary_narrative_function: "To explore the deeper, more esoteric spiritual dimensions of Primal Mama beyond established norms (celebr ity gods, standard ghost lore). She can act as a source of unique, potentially dangerous knowledge, a guide to hidden  spiritual realities, or a character whose quest uncovers fundamental truths (or unsettling ambiguities) about the world's nature, the Biological  Calamity's spiritual impact, or the 'Primal Mama' entity itself. Her methods offer a distinct flavor  of investigation, blending the archaic with the retro-tech."
    key_internal_conflicts: "The drive for empirical proof  vs. the subjective nature of faith/spirituality; the tension between her inherited traditions and her innovative (and potentially heret ical) methods; loneliness of her singular pursuit vs. a desire for validation or community; hope for divine connection vs. fear of cosmic  indifference or alien malevolence."
    potential_for_development: "Actually making a significant breakthrough in contacting/understanding a ' Primal Echo' or the 'Source'; her experiments having unforeseen consequences on the local spiritual ecosystem (e.g., attracting powerful  entities, or briefly thinning the veil further); facing direct opposition from the celebrity cults or other powers; finding unexpected allies (perhaps  an Erpenthrope intrigued by her persistence, or a Swamp Witch seeing a kindred spirit); potentially discovering that the ' God' she seeks is far stranger or more integrated into the Primal Mama world (e.g., the swamp itself , the collective unconscious, or even the nature of the GE alligators) than she imagines."
