    property_id: "N/A"
    status: "None Authenticated."
     description: "Jeb Dubois operates entirely under the established alethic, deontic, axiological, and epistemic modalities of Pr imal Mama. His victimhood is a result of these modalities being exploited by more powerful entities, not from any unique exception he  possesses."

 character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
  core_essence: 'Jebediah Dubois is constituted as a  living testament to the brutal socio-economic realities of Primal Mama, specifically the crushing power of the meat oligarchy ( Consolidated GatorCorp) in places like Lickskillet. His Physical (mangled hand, weathered appearance), Functional (loss of  skills, inability to work), and Psychological (grief, resentment, broken pride) properties are direct consequences of his victim hood under the world''s Deontic (exploitative corporate practices) and Axiological (devaluation of independent labor)  systems. His history is one of decline from respected self-sufficiency to marginalized despair, a direct result of the "Consolidated GatorCorp  Squeeze." He is a man whose connection to the traditional, solar-powered, 1970s- aesthetic bayou life has been severed.'
  primary_narrative_function: 'To serve as a poignant example of the human  cost of the oligarchy''s dominance; to provide a personal face to the "friction" mentioned in the Coherence Protocol ; to potentially act as a catalyst for other characters (e.g., inspiring pity, a desire for justice, or serving as  a cautionary tale); to embody the fading spirit of Lickskillet''s independent past; to potentially seek aid from  or offer crucial information to protagonists about the oligarchy''s methods or the swamp''s hidden dangers.'
  key _internal_conflicts: 'Pride vs. Need (struggling to accept his fall and dependency); Hope vs. Despair  (a flicker of desire for justice against overwhelming odds); Memory of Strength vs. Reality of Weakness (the ghost of his former  self haunting his present incapacitation); Faith (in old ways/deities) vs. Bitter Disillusionment.'
  potential _for_development: 'Finding a new, albeit different, purpose (e.g., storyteller, keeper of lost swamp lore);  becoming a reluctant voice for the downtrodden if galvanized; succumbing further to bitterness and becoming a tool for darker elements ; or finding a measure of peace/acceptance. His knowledge of old swamp ways (Functional/Historical) could become unexpectedly valuable .'
