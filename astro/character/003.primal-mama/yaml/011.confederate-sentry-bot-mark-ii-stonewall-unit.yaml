    physical_properties:
       purpose: "Define the automaton's tangible presence, adhering to the 1970s tech aesthetic."
       appearance_general: '[Bipedal automaton, approximately 7ft tall. Chassis constructed from riveted, matte  grey and faded butternut-yellow painted metal plates (evoking Confederate uniform colors), with visible hydraulic/pneumatic joints. Overall design is  chunky, functional, and clearly from a late 1970s design philosophy – think bulky components, exposed wiring  looms neatly bundled with plastic ties, and a general lack of sleekness.] # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence : Technological Aesthetic Constraint]'
      appearance_specific_features: '[Domed head unit with a single, large, circular optical sensor  (resembling a camera lens from a 1970s news camera) protected by a thick perspex cover . No facial features. Broad shoulder pauldrons featuring a stenciled, stylized saltire in faded red. Chest plate features  a large, circular speaker grille and several chunky, Bakelite-style indicator lights (red, amber, green).] #  Auth: [Visual Design Concept based on 70s tech]'
      appearance_distinctive_marks: '[ Often bears scuffs, dents, and swamp grime from deployment. Some units might have ersatz "battle damage" stylistically  applied during manufacture. Serial number stenciled prominently on back plate (e.g., "CSB-MkII -SN7341"). A noticeable solar-cell array, resembling a miniaturized 1970s  solar water heater panel, is integrated into its back, looking somewhat like a high-tech bedroll.] # Auth:  [Primal Mama Coherence: Solar Dominance]'
      typical_attire: "[N/A - Chassis * is* its form. May have a tattered, symbolic sash or banner fragment attached by its owners/operators, if  they are particularly zealous.] # Auth: [World Details]"
      voice_speech_pattern: '[Synthesized, deep  monotone voice delivered through its chest speaker. Limited vocabulary consisting of pre-programmed phrases like "HALT. IDENTIFY.", "AUTHORIZED  PERSONNEL ONLY.", "WARNING: LETHAL FORCE ENGAGED.", "MOVE ALONG, CITIZEN." Occasionally  emits a distorted, synthesized bugle call ("Dixie" or "The Rebel Yell") for intimidation or alert status. No complex  conversational ability (LLMs are stigmatized).] # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence: Automaton/LLM  User Stigma]'
      gait_mannerisms: '[Heavy, deliberate, rhythmic clanking gait. Upper torso  can swivel 180 degrees. When alerted, movements become surprisingly swift but still mechanically precise. Optical sensor often sweeps  its designated patrol area.] # Auth: [Functional Design]'
      associated_scent: '[Ozone, hot hydraulic  fluid, faint metallic tang, sometimes swamp mud or alligator musk if deployed rurally.] # Auth: [Sensory Palette]'
       physical_undersaturation: "[Internal schematics beyond what's visually implied by 70s tech; exact weight ; precise sound frequency of its vocalizations.]"

      ability_weaponry: '[Integrated arm-mounted "Electro-Musket" – a  bulky, 1970s sci-fi styled energy weapon that fires visible electrical bolts with a loud crackle . Limited ammunition/charge capacity, requires periodic recharge or capacitor replacement.] # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence: Technological Aesthetic  Constraint, Gun Ownership (Regional) implies diverse weaponry]'
      ability_limited_solar_augmentation: '[Can passively  trickle-charge its internal bio-batteries (akin to GE Alligators) in direct sunlight via its back-mounted  array, extending patrol duration but insufficient for sustained high-energy operation. Primarily relies on charging stations.] # Auth: [Primal Mama  Coherence: Solar Dominance, Alligator Biogenesis (shared tech principle)]'
      limitation_cognitive:  '[Extremely limited AI. Operates on rigid "if-then" programming. Cannot adapt to novel situations or complex  moral quandaries. No independent decision-making beyond threat assessment protocols. Susceptible to logical traps or exploiting its programming loopholes.] #  Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence: Automaton/LLM User Stigma]'
      limitation_physical : '[Bulky and somewhat slow in cluttered or uneven terrain (e.g., dense swamp). Vulnerable to targeted attacks  on joints, optical sensor, or power core. Susceptible to powerful electrical surges or specialized counter-automaton weaponry.] #  Auth: [Design Tradeoffs]'
      limitation_social: '[Its very existence and its operators/owners suffer  the "stain on their reputation." Public reaction is often negative, fearful, or derisive.] # Auth: [ Primal Mama Coherence: Automaton/LLM User Stigma]'
      limitation_maintenance: '[Requires  regular maintenance for its 1970s-era mechanical and electrical components. Parts may be scarce or custom- fabricated, reflecting the aesthetic constraint.] # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence: Technological Aesthetic Constraint]'

      official_role : '[Security Automaton, Sentry, Property Guardian, Intimidation Asset.] # Auth: [Deployment Context]'
      social _status: '[Tool; Property of its owner. Its use signifies either extreme wealth/power (in Beetriot) or a desperate /fringe adherence to outdated ideologies/security methods (in Lickskillet or remote areas). Users are viewed with  suspicion/distaste.] # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence: Automaton/LLM User Stigma,  Cattle as Artifacts (parallels elite ownership)]'

    ax iological_properties:
      purpose: "Define the automaton's value status *within* Primal Mama."
       reputation_among_elite_owners: "[Valued as an intimidating, loyal, and uncorruptible (if  simplistic) guardian. A status symbol demonstrating wealth and a certain 'traditionalist' (and likely controversial) leaning, despite the  general Automaton stigma they also bear for using it.] # Auth: [Inferred from Deontic/Axi ological rules]"
      reputation_general_populace_lickskillet: '[Object of fear, derision, and  resentment. Seen as a clunky, oppressive relic representing outdated and hateful ideologies, amplified by the general distrust of automatons. Likely a  target for vandalism or sabotage if an opportunity arises.] # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence: Automaton/LL M User Stigma, Implied social tensions]'
      reputation_swamp_witches_erpenthrop es: "[Likely viewed as an unnatural, noisy, and ultimately foolish construct of 'city folk' or those clinging to dead ideas . Erpenthropes might see it as a perversion of true strength/form. Witches might find its  predictable patterns easy to circumvent or its materials useless for their craft.] # Auth: [Inferred character values]"
       moral_alignment_narrative_framing: "[Tool. Its actions are extensions of its owner's morality.  However, its inherent symbolism is deeply negative and antagonistic due to its Confederate-inspired design and oppressive function.] # Auth: [World Context ]"
      axiological_undersaturation: "[Specific opinions from deified celebrity cults; value as scrap (though likely considerable given  its 70s tech components).]"

    historical_properties:
      purpose: "Define the automaton' s known origins and connections to past events."
      origin: '[Manufactured post-Calamity by niche, possibly controversial , tech outfits (e.g., "Dixie Dynamics Automated Solutions," likely a subsidiary of a larger Beetriot corporation  or a specialized Lickskillet workshop catering to particular tastes). Design is intentionally evocative of pre-Calamity Confederate soldiers but  filtered through the 1970s tech aesthetic. Not genuinely ''ancient''.] # Auth: [Primal  Mama Coherence: Technological Aesthetic Constraint]'
      key_past_event_connection: '[Units of this type may have been deployed  in past labor disputes at alligator processing plants, to guard elite cattle-artifact enclosures in Beetriot, or by fringe groups  attempting to assert control in remote swamp territories. Their presence often signals or escalates tension.] # Auth: [Plaus ible World History]'
      inherited_items: "[N/A. It *is* the item.] # Auth: [Nature  of Entity]"
      historical_undersaturation: "[Exact date of first Mark II deployment; specific notorious incidents involving these units  (though such incidents are highly probable and make good story fodder).]"

character_constitution_summary_narrative_ function:
  purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts (or lack thereof for an automaton), and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
  core_essence: "The CSB-Mark II \"St onewall\" unit is a material embodiment of Primal Mama's core tensions: advanced (for its type) yet aesthetically  constrained (1970s) technology, the persistence of divisive historical symbolism in a radically new world, and the societal anxieties  surrounding automation. It is a clanking, anachronistic threat, a tool of oppression whose very design is a provocation , further burdened by the general stigma against automatons. It is loyalty programmed into a 7-foot, 19 70s-does-the-Confederacy metal shell, powered by the sun but fueled by problematic ideologies."
  primary _narrative_function: "Physical Obstacle/Threat; Symbol of Oppression and Outdated Ideologies; Embodiment of  the \"Automaton User Stigma\"; Visual Reinforcement of the 1970s Tech Aesthetic and Primal  Mama's unique cultural blend; Catalyst for conflict and character reactions (fear, defiance, disgust)."
  key_internal_conf licts_simulated_externalized: "The \"conflict\" it embodies is external: its programmed directives vs. the  desires/freedoms of those it encounters; its symbolic meaning vs. the lived reality of Primal Mama's  inhabitants; the utility it provides its owner vs. the social stain its use incurs."
  potential_for_development _as_narrative_element: "Could be destroyed, captured and reprogrammed (with difficulty due to 70s tech  and limited AI), become a derelict landmark, have its parts salvaged for other retro-tech creations, or its presence  could incite a localized rebellion. Its \"development\" is in how the world and characters react to and change *it* or its  status."
