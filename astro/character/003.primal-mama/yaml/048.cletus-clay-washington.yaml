  character_constitution_summary_and_narrative_function:
    core_essence: " Cletus \"Clay\" Washington is constituted as a living testament to the devastating intersection of unchecked corporate power (Meat Oligarchy) and  weaponized societal paranoia (the \"Invisible Women\" conspiracy) within Primal Mama. His identity is forged in loss: lost livelihood  (Functional), lost reputation (Axiological), lost social standing (Social), and lost hope (Psychological). He  is a man whose skills and adherence to the world's accepted technological norms (70s aesthetic, solar power) were twisted  into evidence of unnatural influence. His existence demonstrates the fragility of truth and security for the common individual in Lickskillet ." # Contains colons, quoted.
    primary_narrative_function: "To embody the human cost of Primal  Mama's socio-economic and epistemic dysfunctions. Serves as a cautionary tale, a potential source of information  (if trust can be gained) about the oligarchy's methods and the conspiracy's real-world impact. His plight  can motivate other characters or highlight the stakes of challenging the established order. He could also, if pushed far enough or offered a sli ver of hope, become a catalyst for localized resistance or truth-seeking."
    key_internal_conflicts:
       - "The desire for justice/truth vs. the paralyzing fear of further harm."
      - "The memory of his former , capable self vs. his current broken state."
      - "The instinct to warn or help others vs. the learned behavior of  isolation for survival."
      - "The bitterness towards his community vs. a residual longing for acceptance."
    potential _for_development:
      - "Finding a trustworthy ally who sees his true character (Social/Relational change )."
      - "Slowly overcoming his fear to share crucial information (Psychological/Functional change)."
      - "Discovering  concrete evidence of how he was framed (Epistemic shift)."
      - "Finding a new, albeit small,  purpose that reclaims a fraction of his dignity (Psychological/Axiological change)."
      - "Becoming a reluctant symbol  or voice for other victims."
