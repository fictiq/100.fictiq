  character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
     purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.
    core_essence:  >-
      Jebediah "Gator-Bait" Jones is constituted as the quintessential Primal Mama  Lickskillet denizen:
      a product of the post-Calamity world, his life and livelihood inextricably linked  to the GE solar alligators
      and the pervasive 1970s technological aesthetic. He embodies rugged independence, traditional  swamp wisdom,
      and a deep-seated suspicion of the encroaching meat oligarchy and the distant, decadent Beet riot.
      His existence is a testament to adaptation, defined by the practical skills needed to survive in the bayou
       and navigate its unique socio-economic landscape, all while clinging to a vanishing sense of autonomy and
      cultural identity symbolized  by his firearms, his battered airboat, and his quiet reverence for the celebrity
      deities of a "simpler" past .
    primary_narrative_function: >-
      To serve as a grounding viewpoint character representing the everyday  struggles, values, and perspectives
      of the common folk in Primal Mama's rural, alligator-dependent regions like  Lickskillet.
      He can act as a source of local lore, an obstacle or ally to protagonists from outside his  culture,
      and a direct illustration of the impact of the world's core rules (e.g., Saurian Sanctuary regulations ,
      oligarchy pressures, the utility and limitations of 1970s tech). He embodies the tension  between
      individual self-reliance and systemic forces.
    key_internal_conflicts_from_bundle:  >-
      The drive for independence vs. the crushing economic power of the meat oligarchy.
      Adherence to traditional  methods/values vs. the necessity of adapting to survive in a technologically
      advanced (albeit aesthetically retro) world.  Loyalty to his community vs. the temptation of individual
      gain or escape. Skepticism of the "new" (Automat ons, complex GE explanations) vs. the undeniable
      reality of the world he lives in.
    potential_for_ development_based_on_bundle: >-
      Could be pushed into a leadership role in local resistance against the  oligarchy.
      Might be forced to confront or reluctantly utilize elements he distrusts (e.g., information
       from an Automaton user, aid from an Erpenthrope). Could have his folk beliefs challenged or confirmed by 
      direct encounters with more overt supernatural elements (powerful ghosts, witch rituals).
      May have to pass on his knowledge to  a younger generation, confronting his own obsolescence or legacy.
