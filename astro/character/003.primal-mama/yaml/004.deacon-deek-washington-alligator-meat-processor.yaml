        auth:  'This Codex'

   character_constitution_summary:
    core_essence: 'Deacon "Deek" Washington is constituted as  a bedrock of Lickskillet''s working class, a skilled artisan whose life is inextricably tied to the Primal Mama world'' s primary protein source: the alligator. His identity is forged in the practical realities of his labor, the 1970 s aesthetic of his tools and environment, and the cultural norms of a society that reveres certain celebrities and abhors cattle flesh . He embodies pragmatism, resilience, and a quiet pride in honest work, tinged with a wary skepticism towards the powerful  and the unknown (from Beetriot oligarchs to the deeper supernatural elements of the swamp, which he respects with practical caution). His African  features root him visually in the diverse human tapestry of this post-calamity Southern Gothic world.'
    primary_narrative _function: 'Serves as a grounded perspective on the world of Primal Mama, particularly life in Lickskillet. He  can act as an informant, a source of local color and wisdom, a representative of the "common folk" impacted by larger events  (like the meat oligarchy''s machinations or Erpenthrope activities), or a reluctant participant if conflict directly threatens his livelihood  or community. He highlights the dignity of manual labor and tradition in a retro-futuristic, spiritually strange setting.'
    key _internal_conflicts: 'Maintaining quality/tradition vs. Oligarchy pressure for efficiency/cost-cutting; Loyalty  to local community/small business vs. personal/economic survival; Innate pragmatism/skepticism vs. the undeniable  (if not fully understood) supernatural elements of his environment.'
    potential_for_development: 'Could be pushed into  a leadership role among local processors if the oligarchy tightens its grip. Might be forced to confront or seek aid from supernatural  entities (Swamp Witches, Erpenthropes) if a crisis demands it. Could learn to adapt some new ( but still 1970s-aesthetic-compliant) technologies or methods if convinced of their practical benefit and "cleanliness"  (re: Automaton stigma). His understanding of the wider world could expand through interaction with outsiders.'
