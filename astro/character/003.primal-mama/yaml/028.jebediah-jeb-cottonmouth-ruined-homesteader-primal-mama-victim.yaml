introduction: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of  **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole žel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative  source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.

  Use  this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from  the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined  nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined .

   character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
    purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal  conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    core_essence: |
      Jebedia h Cottonmouth is constituted as a proud man broken by the systemic greed inherent in Primal Mama's meat oligarchy . His identity, once rooted in the self-sufficient, 1970s-aesthetic-driven enterprise of  alligator processing—a cornerstone of post-Calamity society—has been violently stripped away. He is a living testament  to the "friction" mentioned in the world's deontic rules, embodying the struggle of the common swamp-dweller against powerful , corrupt forces. His bitterness is a direct consequence of his legitimate grievance, and his resilience is a quiet defiance against a  world that has devalued his labor and life. He clings to symbols of a more 'just' past (celebrity  deities, memories of honest work) amidst the strange spiritual miasma and retro-futuristic decay.
    primary_narrative_ function: "To serve as a clear victim and representation of the injustices perpetrated by the meat oligarchy; a potential catalyst for quests for  justice or exposure; a source of grounded, bitter wisdom about the realities of life in Primal Mama's Lick skillet region; a moral touchstone highlighting the human cost of the world's power dynamics."
    key_internal_conf licts: 'The burning desire for his past life/status vs. the crushing reality of his present poverty; The need to warn  others or seek justice vs. the paralyzing fear of further retaliation from the oligarchy; The Southern value of hospitality/community vs.  a deep, learned distrust of everyone.'
    potential_for_development: "Could be galvanized by a protagonist to  share his story or aid in a quest against the oligarchy (Functional/Social change); Might find a new, albeit smaller, purpose  or community (Psychological/Social change); Could pass on his knowledge of alligator processing or swamp survival (Functional change); Might succumb  further to bitterness or paranoia, or find a measure of peace/acceptance (Psychological change). His knowledge of the oligarchy' s past tactics could be crucial."
