Character_Constitution_Summary _Narrative_Function:
  Core_Essence: 'Mayor "Pappy" Beauregard is constituted  as a grotesque embodiment of Primal Mama''s socio-political corruption. He is a tyrant whose power is cemented by monopolizing  the alligator meat economy of Lickskillet, enforcing a stifling version of the 1970s aesthetic as  a tool of conformity, and cynically manipulating the world''s unique spiritual (Celebrity Deities) and epistemic ( Conspiracy Theories) landscape. His folksy, benevolent facade (Physical, Social) barely conceals a core of narcissistic greed and  paranoia (Psychological), making him a master of political maneuvering and intimidation (Functional) within his swampy fiefdom. He is a  product and perverter of Primal Mama''s specific post-Calamity conditions.'
  Primary_Narrative_Function:  'Serves as a primary regional antagonist, representing the oppressive forces against which protagonists (e.g., struggling mom- and-pop gator farmers, truth-seeking Erpenthropes, rebellious Swamp Witches) might struggle.  He embodies the "friction" from the meat oligarchy mentioned in the Coherence Protocol. He is a source of conflict , injustice, and thematic exploration of power, corruption, and manipulated belief in Primal Mama.'
  Key_Internal _Conflicts_From_Bundle:
    - 'Public Benevolence vs. Private Tyranny'
    - 'Des ire for Legitimacy (even from Beetriot/Deities) vs. Methods that Ensure Illegitimacy'
    - ' Fear of the Unknown/Uncontrollable (Erpenthropes, Magic, True Calamity Details) vs. Projection  of Absolute Control'
    - 'Adherence to 1970s Tech Stigma (LLMs) vs.  Secret Envy of Efficiency.'
  Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle: 'His downfall through  exposure or rebellion. Increasing paranoia leading to more erratic and brutal actions. A desperate attempt to co-opt or destroy supernatural  elements that threaten him. Perhaps a late, self-serving attempt to "redeem" his legacy when faced with an  existential threat to Lickskillet itself. His reaction if the "invisible women" conspiracy was proven false, or worse , true in a way he didn''t expect.'
