   CharacterConstitutionSummaryAndNarrativeFunction:
    Purpose: 'Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative  role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.'
    CoreEssence: |
      Mama Gator Juneau is constituted as the resilient  heart of Lickskillet's fading independence. Her identity is forged from a lifetime in the Primal Mama sw amplands, mastering GE alligator husbandry and 1970s analog technology through sheer necessity and grit. She embodies  the Axiological tension between cherished Autonomy and the encroaching, impersonal power of the Meat Oligarchy. Her Functional skills are intrinsically  tied to her Physical environment and the world's specific Technological Aesthetic. Her Psychological makeup (stubborn, pragmatic, fiercely independent) is  a direct result of her Social position as a small operator fighting for survival.
    PrimaryNarrativeFunction: |
      To  serve as a key representative of the "mom-and-pop" sector struggling against the oligarchy, providing a grounded, local perspective  on the Primal Mama world. She can act as a mentor, a source of crucial local knowledge, a symbol of  resistance, or a tragic figure illustrating the costs of the oligarchy's dominance. She grounds the more bizarre elements of the world  in everyday struggle.
    KeyInternalConflicts:
      Value: 'Tradition vs. Pragmatic Adaptation (within 70 s tech). Independence vs. Vulnerability. Community Obligation vs. Self-Preservation. Suspicion of "New" (even  70s-style advanced) vs. Need to Utilize Tools for Survival.'
    PotentialForDevelopment:
       Value: |
        Juneau could be pushed to: organize a local resistance/cooperative (Social/Relational change ); be forced to make a deal with an unlikely ally (e.g., a specific Erpenthrope, a more ethical Beet riot contact, or even a rival small operator); reluctantly adopt a new piece of 1970s-style tech that gives  her an edge (Functional change); or face the loss of her farm, forcing a major Psychological and Social shift.
