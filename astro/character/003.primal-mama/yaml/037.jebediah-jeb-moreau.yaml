CharacterConstitutionSummary:
  CoreEssence: "Jebediah Moreau  is constituted as a man of integrity and traditional skill, deeply connected to the Primal Mama swamp heritage, who is being systematically victimized  and economically strangled by the impersonal, technologically advantaged, and morally flexible Meat Processor Oligarchy. His Physical weathering reflects his Functional  and Psychological burdens. His Social standing is strong locally but nonexistent where it matters for power. He embodies the struggle of the  'little man' against a modernizing, retro-futuristic capitalist force within the unique constraints and aesthetics of Primal  Mama."
  PrimaryNarrativeFunction: "To serve as a primary example and human face of the socio-economic  oppression exerted by the Meat Processor Oligarchy in Lickskillet. To provide a relatable, sympathetic character through whose eyes the audience  can understand the harsh realities for 'mom-and-pop' operations. His plight can be a catalyst for other characters' actions ( e.g., investigation, rebellion, pity) or a tragic illustration of the world's harshness."
   KeyInternalConflicts_FromBundle: "The fight to maintain dignity and provide for family vs. the overwhelming economic and social pressure  from the Oligarchy. Loyalty to traditional, sustainable methods vs. the imposed \"efficiency\" of the new GE-dominated market . The urge to resist injustice vs. the pragmatic fear of retaliation and complete ruin."
  PotentialForDevelopment_BasedOnBundle:  "Jeb could be pushed to a breaking point: either succumbing to despair and losing everything (tragic outcome), making  a desperate and dangerous choice (e.g., dealing with shady elements, attempting sabotage, seeking help from unconventional sources like  Swamp Witches or even Erpenthropes if truly desperate), or becoming a figurehead for a localized, likely  doomed, resistance. He could also find an unexpected ally or a small, temporary reprieve that offers a glimmer of hope."  # Quoted due to colons
