introduction_to_protocol: | 
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings, or complex  automatons treated as such for narrative purposes) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , entities **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex , core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.

  Use this template to systematically  build entities by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted elements whose complexity arises from the **rich ness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the  world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

    purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts (or lack thereof),  and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    core_essence: |
      The Confederate Sentry Autom aton (CSA Unit) is a tangible piece of Primal Mama's layered history and peculiar aesthetic. It's an anachron ism built from anachronisms – a 1970s technological interpretation of a 19th-century soldier , existing in a bizarre retro-future. Constituted by its clunky physicality, rigid programming, and solar-powered limitations , it embodies the world's distrust of advanced AI (by being deliberately unintelligent) and its tendency to repurpose and re- skin technology with nostalgic or ideological veneers. It is a machine, a tool, and a symbol of specific cultural undercurrents within Pr imal Mama – a haunting, somewhat absurd echo of a "lost cause" in a world that has lost much more.
    primary _narrative_function: |
      Serves as an environmental storytelling element, a localized antagonist or obstacle, a  physical representation of certain factions' ideologies (e.g., clinging to past glories, isolationism, traditionalist security). Its  presence can instantly signal the nature of a location or its inhabitants. Can provide moments of tension, dark humor (due to  its clunkiness or predictable responses), or serve as a puzzle for characters to overcome.

       points:
        - "Programmatic rigidity vs. novel situations"
        - "Limited battery/solar dependency  vs. environmental conditions (night, deep swamp canopy)"
        - "Robust but unsophisticated design vs. clever  human tactics or specialized anti-automaton measures."
    potential_for_development_or_modification:
       description: "As a machine, its \"development\" is external"
      points:
        - "It can  be damaged, destroyed, salvaged for parts, reprogrammed (if access codes are found or systems hacked in a 197 0s way – e.g., swapping out a ROM cartridge or rewiring a control panel), or its physical components upgraded/dow ngraded within the world's tech aesthetic."
