Character_Constitution_Summary:
  purpose:  "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
  Core_ Essence: |
    Tebe Mokoena is constituted as a proud, skilled, and fundamentally decent man,  an independent alligator farmer embodying the self-reliant spirit of Primal Mama's Lickskillet region. His African heritage is subtly  woven into his identity through names and minor cultural expressions, adapted to the swamp world. He is defined by his practical expertise with  GE solar gators and 1970s-aesthetic technology, and his deep connection to his family and modest business.  Crucially, he is constituted as a primary **victim** of the encroaching Meat Oligarchy, whose economic power and  ruthless tactics are systematically destroying his livelihood and crushing his spirit. His struggle highlights the tension between individual autonomy and corporate-style power within  Primal Mama's unique socio-economic landscape.
  Primary_Narrative_Function: |
    To  embody the plight of the "common man" under duress from systemic injustice (the Meat Oligarchy); To serve as  a focal point for exploring themes of economic disparity, resilience, desperation, and the potential for resistance or tragedy in Lick skillet. He can act as a catalyst for a protagonist's involvement, a source of local information, or a  tragic figure whose fate underscores the world's harsh realities.
  Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: |
     Pride in self-sufficiency vs. the crushing reality of his powerlessness; Hope for the future of his family vs. encroaching despair ; The urge to resist or seek justice vs. the paralyzing fear of complete ruin and Oligarchy retaliation; Loyalty to traditional methods  vs. the need for new, perhaps ethically grey, solutions to survive.
  Potential_for_Development_Based _on_Bundle: |
    Tebe could be pushed to make desperate choices: seeking help from unconventional sources ( an Erpenthrope sympathetic to the downtrodden? A reclusive Swamp Witch with an axe to grind against the Olig archy?), attempting a risky act of defiance, falling into deeper despair and paranoia, or being reluctantly forced to abandon his farm and seek  work within the very system destroying him. His victimization could radicalize him or break him.
