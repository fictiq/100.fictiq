    This protocol guides the detailed definition  of Fictional Persons (characters, significant sentient beings)
    within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole žel's framework, characters ARE constituted by the
    bundle of properties authenticated for them by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex,  core narratives).
    They possess no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition.

  character_constitution_summary_narrative_function:
     purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.
    core_essence:  |
      Jolene "Jo" Croft is constituted as the resilient, pragmatic heart of Lickskillet's dwindling independent  spirit.
      Her existence is a constant negotiation between the harsh realities of the Primal Mama swamp,
      the crushing economic  pressure of the Meat Oligarchy, and the ingrained 1970s technological
      and cultural aesthetics of her world.  She is defined by her Functional capabilities (gator farming/processing,
      skiff handling) and her Psychological determination , rooted in her Historical inheritance (family business,
      Lickskillet upbringing) and Axiological standing as a  symbol of local grit. Her primary conflict
      stems from her Social/Economic position as a small operator versus a powerful , exploitative system.
    primary_narrative_function: |
      Can serve as a protagonist embodying the struggle for  survival and dignity in Primal Mama's underclass.
      Alternatively, a key viewpoint character providing an authentic window into Lick skillet life,
      grounding the more bizarre elements of the world. Her actions (or inactions) can  trigger or react
      to larger plot movements involving the Oligarchy, resource scarcity, or even encounters with the
      stranger  facets of the swamp (Witches, Erpenthropes, fallout from GE gator escapes).
    key_internal _conflicts: |
      The will to maintain independence vs. the pragmatic need for survival (which might mean compromising with the Olig archy).
      Loyalty to traditional Lickskillet methods vs. the temptation/necessity of risky innovation.
       Hope for a better future vs. the ingrained cynicism born of experience.
      Personal safety vs. defending her livelihood/community .
    potential_for_development: |
      Jolene could be pushed to: organize other small operators (Social  change);
      uncover a dangerous secret about the Oligarchy's practices or the GE gators (Epistemic change );
      be forced into an uneasy alliance with an Erpenthrope or even a sympathetic Beetriot outcast (Relational change); 
      or adapt her 1970s tech in an ingenious, unexpected way to gain an edge (Functional /Axiological change – ingenuity is valued).
      She might also be forced to confront the limits of her knowledge  regarding the supernatural elements of her world.
