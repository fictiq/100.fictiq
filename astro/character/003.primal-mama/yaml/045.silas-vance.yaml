Character_Constitution_Summary_Narrative_Function:
  purpose : "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
  Core _Essence: |
    Silas Vance is constituted as a man of deep integrity and self-reliance, with  strong African heritage, intrinsically tied to the Lickskillet swamp community and its traditions of alligator harvesting. His existence is defined by the  practical application of aging 1970s-era technology and a profound understanding of the natural world. He is  a direct victim of Primal Mama's core socio-economic conflict: the oppressive power of the Beetriot-based  meat oligarchy crushing independent, "mom-and-pop" operations. His struggle embodies the tension between traditional, autonomous  lifestyles and the encroaching, impersonal forces of a post-calamity capitalism, all filtered through the world's  unique aesthetic and ecological rules.
  Primary_Narrative_Function: |
    To serve as a primary example and human face  of the "friction" caused by the meat processor oligarchy, as highlighted in the Primal Mama Coherence Protocol ( Deontic Modalities). His plight can illustrate the systemic injustice within Primal Mama, drive plots involving resistance or desperation in L ickskillet, and offer a ground-level perspective on the world's economic realities, contrasting sharply with the elite  of Beetriot. He can also serve to highlight the value of community and resilience in the face of adversity.
   Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: |
    The drive to maintain his independence and moral code vs.  the crushing economic pressure to submit or take desperate measures. His innate hope and belief in fairness vs. the encroaching despair  and resentment fueled by systemic exploitation. The need to provide for himself (and any dependents) vs. the diminishing returns and  increasing risks of his profession.
  Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle: |
    Sil as could be pushed towards seeking unconventional aid (e.g., from Swamp Witches, or even appealing to an Erpenth rope if one is revealed to have sympathies). He might become a reluctant leader of local discontent, or conversely, be broken by  the pressure. His story could involve a desperate gamble, a flight from debt, or an attempt to find an alternative livelihood  in a world with limited options for someone of his skillset and aversion to stigmatized LLM/Automatons.
