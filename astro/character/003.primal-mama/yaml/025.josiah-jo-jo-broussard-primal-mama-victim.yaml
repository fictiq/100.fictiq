Introduction: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of Fictional Persons (characters, significant sentient beings) within the  Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters ARE constituted by the bundle of properties authenticated for  them by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition .
  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted  individuals whose complexity arises from the richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember undersaturation: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally  left undefined.

Occasionally a wide-brimmed straw hat against the sun when working the solar panels  for his gator pens. # Auth: [Primal Mama Aesthetic Guide (Lickskillet Working Class)]
      Voice _Speech_Pattern: Warm, baritone Louisiana Creole accent, often speaking slowly as if weighing his words or conserving energy. Pr one to sighs. Can rise in passion when speaking of injustice or his family. # Auth: [Dialogue Direction / Regional  Dialect Guide]

    Historical_Properties:
      Purpose: Define  the character's known origins and connections to past events.
      Origin: Born and raised in Lickskillet . Family farm established by his grandfather shortly after GE Alligators became viable post-Calamity, utilizing early solar tech within  the 1970s aesthetic. # Auth: [Local History/Character Backstory]
      Key_ Past_Event_Connection: Witnessed the gradual decline of independent farming in Lickskillet as the Meat Oligarchy consolidated power,  buying out or crushing smaller operations. Remembers his father's struggles, which mirror his own but have become more acute . # Auth: [Character Memory/Local History]

       Historical_Undersaturation: Specific details of his ancestors' survival during the Biological Calamity; any notable family achievements or  shames pre-dating the current economic hardship. # Corrected for Josiah

  Character_Constitution_Summary_and_ Narrative_Function:
    Core_Essence: "[Josiah \"Jo-Jo\" Broussard is constituted as  an embodiment of the Primal Mama world's working-class struggle, particularly in Lickskillet. He is a man  defined by his connection to his family, his ancestral (though technologically dependent on GE gators and solar tech) farm, and the  relentless economic pressure exerted by the Meat Oligarchy. His existence is a testament to resilience in the face of systemic exploitation,  grounded in the world's 1970s retro-tech aesthetic and bayou culture. He is a victim of the  world's deontic structure (oligarchy power, ineffective local governance) and its axiology (his honest labor is undervalued). ]" # Inner quotes escaped
    Primary_Narrative_Function: "[To represent the human cost of the Meat Olig archy's dominance; to provide a grounded, sympathetic viewpoint character for exploring the socio-economic realities of Licksk illet; to potentially act as a catalyst or reluctant participant in any narrative arc involving resistance or investigation into the oligarchy's practices . He highlights the disparity between the \"incredible source of energy\" (solar) and its equitable distribution or benefit.]"  # Inner quotes escaped
    Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: "[Pride in self-sufficiency vs. Crushing  weight of debt and dependence on predatory lenders/buyers. Love for family vs. Fear of failing them. Desire for justice vs . Pragmatic fear of retaliation from the powerful. Hope for future vs. Daily grind of poverty and exploitation. Distrust  of advanced tech (Automatons/LLMs due to stigma) vs. The potential benefits he's missing.]"
     Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle: "[Josiah could be pushed to a breaking point, leading to  desperate actions (potentially illegal or dangerous). He might become involved with individuals seeking to expose or challenge the oligarchy (e .g., an Erpenthrope truth-seeker, an investigative journalist from outside Lickskillet). His practical  skills could become vital in unexpected circumstances. He could be forced to confront his prejudices (e.g., about Automaton users or even  Swamp Witches) if they offer an unlikely path to survival or resistance.]"
