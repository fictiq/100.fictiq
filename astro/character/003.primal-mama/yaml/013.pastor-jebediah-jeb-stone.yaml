        - Appearance_General: 'Human male, appears late 50s/early 60s,  weathered face from sun and swamp air, wiry build but with a stoop of someone who carries burdens or spends much  time in contemplation.'
          Auth: This Entry
        - Appearance_Specific_Features: 'Kind, clear blue  eyes that hold a deep weariness but also a spark of conviction. Thinning grey hair, often damp from humidity.  Pronounced Adam''s apple.'
          Auth: This Entry
        - Appearance_Distinctive_Marks: 'Calloused hands , not just from prayer books but from mending things around his small chapel in Lickskillet. A faint, old scar  across his chin from a ''misunderstanding'' in his younger, more fiery days.'
          Auth: This Entry
         - Typical_Attire: 'Simple, often mended, button-up shirt (perhaps a faded plaid or  solid earth tone), durable denim or canvas trousers tucked into practical swamp boots.

  CharacterConstitutionSummaryAndNarrativeFunction:
     CoreEssence: 'Pastor Jebediah Stone is constituted as a relic of an older faith, a man of sincere Christian conviction ( as it has survived and been interpreted in post-Calamity Primal Mama) striving to offer spiritual guidance in a  world dominated by bizarre new deities, pervasive swamp magic, and retro-futuristic anxieties. His existence is a quiet but persistent challenge to  Primal Mama''s dominant axiological and epistemic norms. He finds meaning in his steadfastness, his service to  a small flock, and his belief in a divine order that transcends the tangible, solar-powered, alligator-fueled reality around him.  His understanding of God, sin, and salvation is filtered through the lens of the Biological Calamity, the 1 970s aesthetic that defines "proper" things, and the ever-present spiritual miasma of the bayou .'
    PrimaryNarrativeFunction: 'Moral counterpoint to the prevailing Primal Mama culture; spiritual guide for characters  seeking alternatives to celebrity worship or swamp magic; source of conflict when his beliefs clash with others''; potential provider of forgotten lore or a  different perspective on the Calamity; symbol of enduring human need for faith and meaning even in the strangest of worlds .'
    KeyInternalConflicts: 'Faith vs. Despair at the state of the world; Duty to preach Truth  vs. Prudence in a world hostile to his message; Compassion for individuals vs. Condemnation of their beliefs/practices ( e.g., celebrity worship, witchcraft); Adherence to tradition vs. Need to adapt to survive in Primal Mama .'
    PotentialForDevelopment: 'Could discover texts or relics that recontextualize his faith for Primal Mama ; might be forced into an uneasy alliance with ''unholy'' elements (e.g., a Swamp Witch, an Erp enthrope) for a greater good; his faith could be severely tested by a direct confrontation with the ''divine''  power of a celebrity god''s manifestations or the deeper truths of the Calamity; could inspire a revival or bemartyred for  his beliefs.'
