introduction: |
   This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal  Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them**  by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition **.

  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals  whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically  grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what  is intentionally left undefined.

  constitution_summary_narrative_function:
    purpose: "Synthesize  the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    core_essence: |
       Deacon "Gator" Brown is constituted as an Erpenthrope deeply woven into the fabric of Primal Mama's  swamp communities. He is a fusion of ancient power and grassroots leadership, a near-immortal being whose existence is dedicated to the mortal  "little folk." His identity is forged in the crucible of resisting the oppressive meat oligarchy, fueled by a profound sense  of justice, a truth-seeking Erpenthrope nature, and a deep love for his people and their 197 0s-infused, solar-reliant way of life. He embodies the resilience of the swamp and the enduring spirit of  those who live in harmony with it, against forces that would exploit it.
    primary_narrative_function:  |
      Protagonist or Major Supporting Character leading resistance against the primary antagonists (Meat Oligarchy). Serves as a  moral compass, a source of wisdom and hope for the oppressed. Embodies the themes of community, justice, resilience,  and the complex relationship between humanity, nature, and strange powers in Primal Mama. His Erpenthrope nature allows exploration  of "otherness" and the burden/blessing of unique power.
    key_internal_conflicts_ from_bundle: |
      - The immense burden of being a long-lived protector watching generations pass.
      - Maintaining  hope and inspiring action against a seemingly insurmountable oligarchy.
      - The need to use his fearsome Erpenth rope form for protection versus the risk of alienating or terrifying his own people or attracting overwhelming force from Beetriot.
       - Balancing his truth-seeking Erpenthrope drive with the immediate, pragmatic needs of his community.
      -  Reconciling his inherent distrust of overarching authority with the necessity of organized resistance.
    potential_for_development_based_on _bundle: |
      - Uncovering deeper truths about the meat oligarchy, the biological calamity, or the nature  of Erpenthropes.
      - Forging wider alliances (e.g., with other marginalized groups,  disillusioned Beetriot citizens, or even certain Swamp Witches).
      - Being forced to make increasingly difficult moral choices in  the fight against the oligarchy.
      - Mentoring a successor or inspiring a new generation of resistance.
       - Confronting the limits of his own power or understanding, possibly seeking out older Erpenthropes or deeper spectral  knowledge.
