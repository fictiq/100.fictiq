      auth: 'Inferred Local Perception '

      auth: 'Oligarchy Perspective' 
    Moral_Alignment_Narrative_Framing:

       auth: 'Implied Narrative Stance'
    Adherence_To_1970s_Aesthetic:

      value: "Her reputation among  Swamp Witches (likely indifferent unless she encroaches on their territory/resources); specific views by individual members of the Deified  Trio's 'clergy' (if such exist formally)."

Character_Constitution_Summary_And_Narrative_Function:
  Core_Essence:
     value: 'Delia "Dee" Mae Coker is constituted as the embodiment of Lickskillet''s resilient, self -reliant spirit, a pragmatic survivor tethered to her family''s legacy and the tangible realities of alligator processing in a  world dominated by high-concept GE and retro aesthetics. Her identity is forged in the friction between traditional swamp practicality and the encro aching pressures of the Beetriot-based meat oligarchy. She is defined by her functional skills with 197 0s-era technology, her psychological fortitude, and her deeply rooted social connections within her local community, contrasted with her  powerlessness against larger economic forces.'
  Primary_Narrative_Function:
    value: "To provide a grounded , sympathetic viewpoint on the socio-economic realities of Primal Mama outside the elite centers; to personify the \"mom-and- pop\" struggle against systemic exploitation; to showcase the daily life, values, and challenges of Lickskillet citizens;  potential catalyst or victim in narratives involving the meat oligarchy's influence."
  Key_Internal_Conflicts:
     value: 'Independence vs. Economic Survival (selling out or adapting); Tradition vs. Necessity (compromising quality or ethics under  pressure); Trust in Community vs. Paranoia (who might be an informant?); Personal Weariness vs. Duty to Legacy.'
   Potential_for_Development:
    value: "Could be forced to make difficult alliances (perhaps even with distrusted  outsiders or users of stigmatized tech if desperate); might become a reluctant leader for other small operators; could discover a vulnerability  in the oligarchy's local operations; might be pushed to the breaking point, leading to loss or a defiant last  stand. Her views on Automatons/LLMs or even the \"Invisible Women\" conspiracy could shift if direct evidence impacted her  business/life."
