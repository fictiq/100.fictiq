introduction: | 
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the  Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole≈æel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or  reality beyond this textual definition**.

  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus  on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and  whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is  essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

        - name: Appearance_Specific_Features
          description: 'Human Form: Striking, intelligent eyes,  the color of dark amber, often holding a knowing, slightly amused glint. Her hair is a thick mane of silver -grey locs, often adorned with small, polished alligator scutes, iridescent beetle carapaces, or carved pieces  of petrified wood. High cheekbones and a broad, expressive mouth.'

         - name: Typical_Attire
          description: 'Human Form: Practical, durable clothing made from woven plant fibers , treated hides (non-cattle, likely gator or other swamp creatures), and repurposed textiles, often in earthy tones of deep  greens, browns, and ochres.

  character_constitution_summary_narrative_ function:
    purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property  bundle."
    core_essence: |
      Mawu "Mama" Gator is constituted as a living embodiment  of Primal Mama's ancient, spiritual, and ecological soul, a bridge between the world-before-calamity and the  retro-futuristic present. Her Erpenthrope nature grants her near-immortality and a deep connection to the Truth , placing her in direct opposition to the superficialities and propaganda of mainstream society (e.g., celebrity worship, cattle  taboo as purely cultural). Her African-coded features and matriarchal bearing further root her in a primal, foundational wisdom. She is  the swamp's memory and its fierce protector, a figure of immense power and profound weariness, operating according to natural  laws that supersede human constructs.
    primary_narrative_function: |
      Serves as a potential mentor , a source of forbidden knowledge/truth, a moral compass aligned with the natural world, and a guardian of ancient secrets. Can act  as a catalyst for other characters' quests for understanding, or an antagonist to those who would exploit the swamp or perpetuate harmful  falsehoods. Represents a challenge to the established order of Primal Mama, not through overt rebellion, but through the sheer  weight of her existence and knowledge.
    key_internal_conflicts: |
      The burden of truth vs . the danger of its revelation; the desire to guide vs. the instinct for self-preservation and secrecy; her  ancient connection to the natural cycle vs. the increasingly artificial and controlled world built by humans; weariness from centuries of observation  vs. the enduring spark of hope/duty to protect.
    potential_for_development: |
      Deciding to share  more of her knowledge, potentially triggering significant societal upheaval. Being forced to directly confront threats to the swamp or other Erpenthrop es. Guiding a protagonist towards a crucial understanding of the world's true nature. Her reaction to individuals who manage to earn her  trust despite her ingrained caution (e.g., an LLM user who genuinely seeks truth despite the stigma). The redis covery or revelation of further aspects of Erpenthrope origins or abilities.
