CharacterConstitutionSummary:
  Purpose: " Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
  CoreEssence : "Jeb Washington is constituted as a living embodiment of Primal Mama's socio-economic casualties. His identity is  forged from the loss of his craft, his pride, and his livelihood at the hands of the powerful meat oligarchy. His skills ( alligator processing, 1970s tech repair) are now rendered largely useless by his lack of capital (Functional  Limitation due to Deontic power plays). Psychologically, he is a blend of simmering resentment, profound nostalgia for a more  equitable past (Axiological dissonance), and the enduring, though wounded, pride of a master craftsman. His African features and deep roots  in Lickskillet ground him firmly in the bayou culture, a stark contrast to the faceless corporate power of  Beetriot."
  PrimaryNarrativeFunction: "To serve as a poignant example of the \"friction\" caused by  the meat processor oligarchies. To provide a voice for the dispossessed in Lickskillet. He can act as a source  of local knowledge, a moral compass reminding protagonists of the human cost of unchecked power, or a potential catalyst for resistance if his  despair can be rekindled into action. He humanizes the abstract concept of \"economic oppression\" within Primal Mama." 
  KeyInternalConflicts: '[Wounded Pride vs. Crushing Poverty; Desire for Justice/Revenge vs. Fear  of Oligarch Retaliation; Nostalgia for Past Autonomy vs. Bleak Present Reality; The skilled hands wanting  to work vs. the lack of opportunity.]'
  PotentialForDevelopment: "[Could be drawn into a plot against the  oligarchs, his knowledge of their early tactics or his old processing skills becoming vital. Might find a new, smaller way to practice his  craft (e.g., barter, secret batches). Could mentor a younger character in the old ways. Could slide further into despair  or find a spark to fight back, perhaps inspired by encountering an Erpenthrope \"truth-seeker\" or a protagonist willing  to challenge the status quo.]"
