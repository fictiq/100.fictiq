introduction:
  title : 'Constituting Fictional Persons Textually'
  text: |
    This protocol guides the detailed definition  of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following  Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative  source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.

    Use this  template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from  the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined  nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined .

characterConstitutionSummary:
  purpose: 'Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts , and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.'
  coreEssence: |
    Ambassador Evelyn " Evie" Dubois is constituted as a bridge-builder in the fractured, retro-futuristic, bayou-infused  world of Primal Mama. Her being is defined by the tension between her Beetriot origins/loyalties and her empathetic drive to  understand and conciliate with the disparate, often hostile, cultures outside the city. Functionally, she is a skilled negotiator  constrained by the 1970s technological aesthetic and the deep-seated social stigmas (e.g., Autom aton use) of her world. Psychologically, her pragmatic idealism is constantly tested by the pervasive paranoia (e.g ., "invisible women" conspiracy), entrenched power structures (meat oligarchy), and the unsettling supernatural realities (Swamp Witches, Er penthropes, ghosts) of Primal Mama. She embodies the struggle for reasoned communication and cooperation in a world steeped in  bizarre traditions (cattle artifacts, celebrity deities) and raw survival instincts.
  primaryNarrativeFunction: |
    Can serve  as a POV character allowing exploration of Primal Mama's diverse factions and their conflicts. Alternatively, a key NPC who facilitates or  complicates the protagonist's interactions with these factions. Her missions can drive plots related to resource disputes, cultural misunderstandings,  political intrigue between Beetriot and Lickskillet, or attempts to mediate with the more enigmatic swamp communities.
   keyInternalConflicts: 'Beetriot Duty vs. Lickskillet/Swamp Empathy; Idealistic Desire for  Cooperation vs. Pragmatic Acceptance of Harsh Realities; Respect for Tradition (including 1970s aesthetic,  celebrity gods) vs. Frustration with Irrationality/Inefficiency; Official Knowledge/Narratives vs. Whis pers of Deeper, More Disturbing Truths.'
  potentialForDevelopment: "Deepening understanding and trust (or  escalating conflict) with Lickskillet or Swamp factions (Social/Relational change). Uncovering unsettling truths about the Cal amity or the nature of power in Primal Mama (Epistemic/Psychological change). Being forced to make  increasingly difficult moral compromises (Axiological/Psychological shift). Acquiring unique knowledge or even a grudging magical boon  from a Swamp Witch (Functional/Epistemic change if narrative supports it without breaking her baseline human status)."
