CharacterConstitutionSummary AndNarrativeFunction:
  _Purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from  the authenticated property bundle."
  CoreEssence: |
    Brother Jebediah Cottonwood is constituted as a conduit for a  lost, or perhaps nascent, spirituality in Primal Mama. He is a man whose entire being is dedicated to seeking a singular , benevolent Divine in a world dominated by retro-futuristic pragmatism, celebrity deification, and bizarre biological realities.  His Functional skills are those of survival and gentle ministry, his Psychological makeup is one of unwavering faith tempered by compassionate sorrow. His  Social position is that of an outsider, a voice in the wilderness. His unique Modal property (Spiritual Sensitivity) isn' t a power, but a lens through which he experiences Primal Mama's "spiritual miasma," reinforcing his quest for a God  beyond the superficial. He embodies the tension between ancient faith and a radically altered present, all filtered through the ubiquitous 1 970s aesthetic in his simple tools and worldview.
  PrimaryNarrativeFunction: |
    To represent an alternative spiritual  path and offer a critique of the world's dominant belief systems. To be a source of potentially forgotten wisdom or a  different kind of "truth" than that sought by Erpenthropes. To provide comfort and moral counterpoint.  His quest for "God" can drive plots involving lost knowledge, hidden sanctuaries, or encounters with other beings who perceive the world's  deeper strangeness.
  KeyInternalConflicts_FromBundle: |
    The challenge of maintaining faith in an absurd and  often hostile world. The loneliness of his unique calling vs. his desire to connect and minister. Reconciling his fragmented  ancient texts with the bizarre reality of Primal Mama (e.g.: how do solar-powered alligators or vampire  bunnies fit into his theology?). The temptation of despair vs. his core of stubborn hope.
  PotentialForDevelopment_BasedOn Bundle: |
    Discovering more complete or clarifying pre-Calamity texts. Encountering others who share his specific faith  or forming a more organized spiritual community. His faith being severely tested by a direct confrontation with the world's harshness or the  seemingly divine power of an Erpenthrope/Swamp Witch. Finding unexpected common ground with a "truth-seeking " Erpenthrope. His interpretations of "God" evolving as he learns more about the world.
