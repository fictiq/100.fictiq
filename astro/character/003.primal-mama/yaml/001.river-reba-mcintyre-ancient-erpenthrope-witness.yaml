Direct connection to and understanding of \"Primal Mama\" (the world\'s vital essence)."' #  Quoted due to colons

    Historical_Properties:

      Origin:
        description: "Authenticated as pre-dating the Biological  Calamity, or being one of the first Erpenthropes to emerge in its immediate aftermath. Her exact ' birth' or transformation into an Erpenthrope is lost to time, even for her, existing as a primal, core memory rather  than a sequential event."
        auth: "Primal Mama Codex (Erpenthrope near-immortality)"
       Key_Past_Event_Connection_Subjective:
        description: "Possesses direct, experiential memories of the world before cattle  became taboo, the chaos of the Calamity, the rise of alligator dependency, the cultural ossification of the  1970s aesthetic, and the gradual deification of figures like Burt Reynolds (which she finds particularly baffling)."

      Inherited_Items:

  Character _Constitution_Summary_And_Narrative_Function:
    Purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts,  and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    Core_Essence: "River \"Reba\" McIntyre  is constituted as an ancient, quasi-mythical Erpenthrope, a living embodiment of Primal Mama's enduring, unt amed bayou heart and its deep, often painful, history. Her Physical properties reflect a seamless blend of human adaptability and reptilian power , sustained by her unique Modal connection to the world's solar and vital energies. Functionally, she is a supreme  survivor and a guardian, capable of formidable action and subtle influence. Psychologically, she is defined by her Erpenth ropic drive for Truth, burdened by millennia of memory yet fiercely committed to a primal sense of justice and balance. Socially an  outsider, her Axiological status oscillates between revered legend and feared anomaly. Her Historical depth provides a unique lens on the world 's current state, viewing its 1970s retro-futurism and celebrity worship with an ancient, knowing  weariness."
    Primary_Narrative_Function: "Serves as a conduit to the deeper lore and forgotten  truths of Primal Mama. Can act as a catalyst for change, a mentor to those who respect the old ways,  or a formidable obstacle to those who would further unbalance the world. Embodies the \"strangely spiritual miasma\" and  the tension between the artificial constructs of society (Beetriot, oligarchy, tech aesthetic) and the enduring power of nature ."
    Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: "The burden of ancient memory vs. the fleeting concerns  of current inhabitants. The Erpenthropic drive for truth vs. the pain and danger such truth often brings. The instinct for solitude  vs. the primal imperative to protect her domain (the swamp/Primal Mama). Her innate wildness vs. the encroaching,  often absurd, \"civilization\" with its cattle-artifacts and Automaton-stigma."
    Potential_for_Development _Based_on_Bundle: "Recovery or sharing of specific, pivotal memories about the Calamity or the origin of Erp enthropes. Formation of unlikely alliances (e.g., with a \"truth-seeking\" Automaton user, or a younger  character disillusioned with the celebrity cults). Being forced to directly confront the Meat Oligarchy or Beetriot's power structures. A  deeper exploration of her connection to \"Primal Mama\" and the nature of spectral entities."
