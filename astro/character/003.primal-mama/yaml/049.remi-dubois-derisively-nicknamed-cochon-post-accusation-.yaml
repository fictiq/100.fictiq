        Reputation _Beetriot_Authorities: "Authenticated as 'Cattle-Fiend', 'Taboo-Breaker',  'Deserving of Death/Punishment'.

   CharacterConstitutionSummaryAndNarrativeFunction:
    Purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative  role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    CoreEssence: "Remi \"Cochon\" Dubois is  constituted as an ordinary Lickskillet resident tragically ensnared by Primal Mama's most severe taboo: the  prohibition of cattle consumption. His identity is defined by his wrongful accusation, the subsequent physical and psychological trauma, and his utter  powerlessness against the overwhelming force of Beetriot's justice system. He embodies the brutal consequences of the world's  foundational laws when misapplied or exploited, transforming from a functional member of his society into a reviled pariah. His African features are  an incidental descriptor of his person, while his suffering is a direct result of Primal Mama's unique societal structure and  values."
    PrimaryNarrativeFunction: "To serve as a stark illustration of the human cost of Primal Mama's  core tenets and the potential for injustice within its system. He can act as a catalyst for another character's actions ( e.g., an investigator, a moral dissenter, an Erpenthrope truth-seeker). His plight can expose the cruelty  underlying the retro-futuristic, bio-punk veneer, particularly the chasm between the elite (Beetriot) and  the common folk (Lickskillet) when faced with the ultimate transgression."
    KeyInternalConflicts: "Hope  for truth/vindication vs. crushing despair and resignation; terror of death/torture vs. remembered pride/d ignity; confusion at the injustice vs. the undeniable reality of his condemnation."
    PotentialForDevelopment: "While his situation is  dire, potential developments could include: being rescued or given a chance to tell his story by an outside party; a desperate  escape attempt (likely futile); further psychological deterioration; or becoming a symbol (martyr) if his innocence is posthumously  suspected or revealed. Any positive development hinges on external intervention, given his authenticated limitations."
