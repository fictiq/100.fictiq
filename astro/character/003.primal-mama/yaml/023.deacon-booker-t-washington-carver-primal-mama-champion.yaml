  character_constitution_summary_and _narrative_function:
    Core_Essence: "Deacon Booker T. Washington Carver is constituted as the resilient  heart and voice of Primal Mama's common folk, specifically those in Lickskillet struggling against the dehumanizing pressures  of the meat oligarchy. His identity is forged from a deep connection to his community, the practical realities of alligator farming  (embracing the 1970s tech aesthetic as a mark of skilled human endeavor), and a profound, lived spirituality centered  on the Deified Trio's perceived virtues of independence and defiance. He is a man whose Physical strength, Functional capabilities (oratory , gator lore), and Psychological fortitude (principled, empathetic) are all directed towards his Social role as a protector  and leader. His rejection of Automatons/LLMs is not just cultural stigma but an axiological stance on the value of human  work and community."
    Primary_Narrative_Function: "To serve as a primary protagonist or major supporting protagonist representing the  \"people's struggle\" against systemic oppression (the meat oligarchy). He embodies the positive values of community, self-reliance , and adaptation within Primal Mama's unique constraints. He can drive plots related to social justice, economic warfare, and the  preservation of cultural identity."
    Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: "The constant pressure of leading a vulnerable community against  a powerful foe. The moral dilemma of when peaceful resistance must give way to more direct confrontation. Balancing his hope for the future  with the often grim realities of the present. His respect for tradition (including the cattle taboo) clashing with the olig archy's attempts to redefine or exploit all resources."
    Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle : "Forging wider alliances (perhaps even with distrusted Erpenthropes or sympathetic Beetriot outsiders). Being  forced to make increasingly difficult choices that test his principles. Inspiring a larger-scale movement or, conversely, facing devastating  setbacks that challenge his resilience. His relationship with the Deified Trio's lore could deepen, finding new interpretations relevant to his struggle."
