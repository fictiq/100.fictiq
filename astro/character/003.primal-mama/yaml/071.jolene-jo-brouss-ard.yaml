introduction: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **F ictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex , core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.

  Use this template to systematically  build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **rich ness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the  world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

  character_constitution _summary_and_narrative_function:
    purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts,  and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    core_essence: "Jolene \"Jo\" Broussard  is constituted as a pragmatic and fiercely independent small business owner in Primal Mama's Lickskillet, embodying the resilience  and resourcefulness of those living on the front lines of the alligator-based economy. Her identity is deeply tied to her  craft, her 1970s-era functional equipment, her local community, and her resistance to the homogen izing pressure of the meat oligarchy. She navigates a world of advanced biotech (GE gators, solar power)  through a lens of practical, analog self-sufficiency and a healthy reverence for the grit embodied by deities like Jerry Reed." 
    primary_narrative_function: "To represent the struggles and values of the \"common person\" in Lickskillet ; to act as a point of contact and source of grounded information/aid for protagonists; to embody the thematic conflict between independent  artisanship/community and corporate control; to showcase the everyday realities of the 1970s retro-future aesthetic  and solar-powered gator economy."
    key_internal_conflicts:
      - "Desire for self- sufficient independence vs. crushing economic pressure from the oligarchy."
      - "Adherence to traditional, quality methods vs . the need to adapt for survival."
      - "Loyalty and duty to her local community vs. the personal  risks of direct confrontation with powerful entities."
      - "Weariness vs. unwavering determination."
    potential_for_development : "Jo could be pushed into a more active leadership role in resisting the oligarchy. She might be forced to seek  uncomfortable alliances (e.g., with more fringe elements like Swamp Witches or even wary Erpenthropes for information /leverage). She could discover a hidden aspect of her family's past related to the Calamity or pre -gator Lickskillet. Her business could face a make-or-break crisis, forcing innovation within the 7 0s tech constraints or a desperate gamble."
