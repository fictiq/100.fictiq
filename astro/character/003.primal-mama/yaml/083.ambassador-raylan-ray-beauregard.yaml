        - to : 'Silas' (Erpenthrope Contact - NPC)

    axiologicalProperties:
       reputations:
        - group: Beetriot Elite
          view: Authenticated as viewed as 'competent', ' a necessary realist', 'effective negotiator', though some harder-line oligarchs see him as 'too accommodating' to swamp interests.
           auth: '[PMC - Social Dynamics]'
        - group: Lickskillet Populace
          view:  Authenticated as 'the official face of Beetriot oppression' by many, but a smaller, more pragmatic segment sees him  as 'predictable' and 'someone you can at least talk to, unlike some others from the city'. Known for  honoring the letter of agreements.
          auth: '[PMC - Social Dynamics]'
        - group: Erpenthropes  with knowledge of him
          view: Viewed as a potentially useful, if unreliable, source of information on Beetriot's intentions;  a typical "surface-dweller" preoccupied with temporary power structures.

      moralAlignment_NarrativeFraming:

        auth: '[PMC - Calamity After math, Economic Shifts]'
      keyPastEventConnection:
        description: Spearheaded the "Lickskillet  Accord negotiations" five years prior, a tense but ultimately successful (for Beetriot) agreement that standardized alligator meat grading and  taxation, further fueling oligarchy friction but preventing open revolt at the time.
        auth: '[Character Backstory Element]' 
      inheritedItems_Status:
        description: Inherited his family's knack for navigating bureaucracy and a significant, though not  top-tier, social standing in Beetriot. His attache case, a 1970s-style  heirloom, was modified with secure internal data-slate readers.
        auth: '[Character Backstory, PMC - Tech  Aesthetic]'
      historicalUndersaturation: Details of his education; specific mentors or patrons in his rise; personal experiences during major historical  events post-Calamity like the full criminalization of cattle consumption.

  characterConstitutionSummaryAndNarrativeFunction :
    coreEssence: "Ambassador Raylan Beauregard is constituted as a high-functioning cog in  Beetriot's complex machinery, a man defined by his role as an intermediary between the polished, technologically advanced (within  70s aesthetic constraints) urban center and the volatile, resource-rich swamplands. His pragmatism is  born from navigating the inherent contradictions of Primal Mama: the reliance on GE solar alligators while adhering to retro tech, the deification  of pop culture icons, and the absolute taboo of cattle flesh juxtaposed with its artifact status. He is a product of Beetriot 's stratified society, skilled in its games, yet forced to confront the raw, often spiritual, realities of the world  beyond its concrete walls."
    primaryNarrativeFunction: To act as a viewpoint character into the political and economic mach inations between Beetriot and the wider Primal Mama world. He can drive plots involving trade disputes, resource allocation, cultural  misunderstandings, and the friction caused by the meat oligarchy. He can also be a conduit for revealing the complexities and  hypocrisies of Beetriot society and its relationship with the supernatural elements it officially ignores or marginalizes.
    key InternalConflicts:
      - Beetriot loyalty vs. swamp realities
      - professional ambition vs. personal weariness
      - upholding  the 1970s aesthetic/social stigmas (Automaton use) vs. the desire for practical efficiency
       - managing oligarchy demands vs. preventing swamp-dweller revolt
      - navigating the official dismissal of supernatural occurrences (Er penthropes, ghosts, witches) while potentially encountering irrefutable evidence of them.
    potentialForDevelopment: Could  be forced to make a stand against the oligarchy or fully commit to its agenda. Might develop a deeper, more empathetic  understanding of swamp culture or Erpenthrope perspectives, potentially challenging his Beetriot conditioning. Could uncover dangerous truths about the Cal amity, the "invisible women" conspiracy, or the true nature of the deified celebrities, forcing him to confront  the epistemic foundations of his society. May be pushed to secretly violate the Automaton/LLM user stigma for a  critical advantage.
