  character_constitution_summary:
    core_ essence: "Jebediah Washington is constituted as a man systematically dismantled by the socio-economic machinery of Primal Mama,  specifically the predatory meat oligarchy (GatorArch Consolidated). His Physical deterioration, Functional limitations, and Psychological despair are direct consequences  of his Historical victimization. He embodies the lived reality of Lickskillet's underclass, a stark contrast to  the opulence of Beetriot or the mythic power of Erpenthropes and Swamp Witches. His belief  in conspiracies like the \\\"invisible women\\\" is an Epistemically limited attempt to make sense of his crushing power lessness. His Social isolation is nearly complete, his primary remaining tie being the agonizing memory and faint hope for his lost daughter, Sarah." 
    primary_narrative_function: "To serve as a poignant illustration of the human cost of Primal Mama's  unique societal structure and power imbalances. He can act as an information source (revealing the ground-level tactics of the oligarchy),  a moral compass point (eliciting empathy and potentially motivating protagonists), or a catalyst for conflict if others attempt to intervene on his behalf or  investigate his claims about GatorArch and his daughter."
    key_internal_conflicts:
      - "The crushing  weight of Hopelessness vs. the father's lingering, desperate Hope for Sarah"
      - "Resentment and  desire for Justice vs. debilitating Fear of GatorArch"
      - "Residual Pride in his past self vs. the humiliating  Present of his destitution."
    potential_for_development: "His trajectory is largely downward without external intervention.  However, contact with protagonists could: reignite a spark of defiance (Psychological change), lead to him sharing crucial information ( Functional shift – becoming an asset), or, if given resources/protection, even attempting a small act of resistance or search for  Sarah (Social/Functional change). Alternatively, further pressure could see him break entirely or make a fatal, desperate move."
