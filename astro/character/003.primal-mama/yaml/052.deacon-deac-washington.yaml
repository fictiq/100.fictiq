introduction:
  title: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually
  paragraph1:  "This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Pr imal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties  authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**."
  paragraph2: "Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their  properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions  within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember ** undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined."

  Character_Constitution_Summary_Narrative_Function:
    Purpose: Synthesize the core  identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.
    Core_Essence: Deacon Washington  is constituted as a living testament to the brutal socio-economic realities of Primal Mama, particularly the "friction" caused  by the meat oligarchy. He is a man stripped of his livelihood, reputation, and dignity through the cynical manipulation of  Primal Mama's core Deontic (cattle laws, tech stigma) and Axiological (value of conformity, fear of taboo ) rules. His existence is defined by loss, flavored by the enforced 1970s retro-futur ism that once characterized his small business's charm and now feels like a mocking echo. He represents the discarded "mom-and- pop" ideal in a world increasingly controlled by unseen corporate powers in Beetriot.
    Primary_Narrative_Function: To  serve as a potent example of the meat oligarchy's oppressive power and the human cost of their expansion. He can act as a  cautionary tale, a source of localized information about the oligarchy's methods in Lickskillet, or a desperate individual who might  be spurred to action (or seek help) if a protagonist offers a glimmer of hope or a path to minor revenge/ revelation. He grounds the more fantastical elements of Primal Mama in relatable human suffering.
    Key_Internal _Conflicts_From_Bundle_: Desire for justice/revenge vs. paralyzing fear of the oligarchy's reach; clinging  to the memory of his faith in figures like Jerry Reed (as a deity of honest work/rebellion) vs. feeling  abandoned by them. # Quoted due to semicolon.
    Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle _: Deacon could be pushed to a breaking point, leading to a reckless act of defiance. He might find a new, albeit diminished , purpose if offered a safe way to contribute to undermining his enemies (e.g., providing information to Erpenthropes  or other rebels). He could also fully succumb to despair and paranoia, becoming a more tragic figure or a pawn in someone else 's game. Recovery of any part of his former self or status is highly improbable without significant external intervention that challenges the oligarchy' s power. # Quoted due to 'e.g.,'.
