  character_constitution_summary_and_ narrative_function:
    purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property  bundle.
    core_essence: "Jabari Washington is constituted as a casualty of Primal Mama's brutal  economic realities, specifically the unchecked power of the meat oligarchy in Lickskillet. His identity is shaped by the loss of  his livelihood, his skills (alligator farming/processing via 1970s tech) rendered useless by overwhelming  force. He embodies the despair and resignation of those crushed by the system, a living ghost of Lickskillet' s dying independent spirit. His African features ground him visually, while his story reflects a universal struggle against systemic oppression within Primal Mama' s unique bayou-infused, retro-futuristic setting."
    primary_narrative_function: "To  serve as a potent example of the meat oligarchy's detrimental impact on ordinary people; to provide a ground-level  perspective on life in Lickskillet for those outside the power structures; to potentially act as a catalyst or informant for  a protagonist investigating the oligarchy or seeking justice; to embody the theme of lost autonomy and the human cost of unchecked progress  or greed."
    key_internal_conflicts: "The crushing weight of Despair vs. flickering embers of  past Pride and a desire for Dignity; Fear of retribution vs. a suppressed longing for Justice or acknowledgment of his Wrong ful Loss; Responsibility for family (implied) vs. utter Inability to provide."
    potential_for_development : "Could be spurred to action by a sympathetic outsider or a desperate situation; could find a new, albeit minor, purpose;  could share crucial information about the oligarchy's past methods; or could tragically succumb entirely to his despair, serving as a grim warning . His knowledge of old Lickskillet ways might become unexpectedly relevant."
