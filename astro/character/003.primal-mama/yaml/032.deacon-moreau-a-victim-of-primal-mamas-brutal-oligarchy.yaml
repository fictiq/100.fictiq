World: Primal Mama 
Codex_Version: '0.2 - Character Constitution'
Last_Updated: '[Current Date]'

Introduction: |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of F ictional Persons (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole≈æel's  framework, characters ARE constituted by the bundle of properties authenticated for them by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives ). They possess no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition.
  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating  their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the richness, coherence, and potential tensions within  their authenticated bundle, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember undersaturation: define what  is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

      Key_Past_ Event_Connection:
        value: 'The "Hostile Takeover/Economic Sabotage" of his family business  by the expanding Meat Oligarchy (circa 5-10 years prior to "present day"). This involved predatory pricing , leveraging control over Saurian Sanctuary access to choke his supply of wild gators, and potentially new "safety/tech standard " regulations (tied to the 1970s aesthetic) that favored large, capitalized operations and made his established  methods "obsolete" or "illegal".'

      Inherited_Items:
         value: 'Authenticated to possess a few well-maintained but now idle traditional alligator processing tools (e.g., a  prized skinning knife with a hand-carved bone handle, his grandfather''s smoking recipes committed to memory). These are now more  mementos than tools of a trade.'
        authentication_source: 'Narrative inventory, Symbolic Link to Past '
      Historical_Undersaturation: 'Specific details of his ancestors beyond "ran the family business"; his life before the  oligarchy''s aggression became acute; any personal involvement with the deified celebrities'' cults or major historical events pred ating his business''s collapse.'

  Character_Constitution_Summary_And_Narrative_Function:
     purpose: 'Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.'
    Core _Essence: |
      Deacon Moreau is constituted as a living testament to the socio-economic brutalities of Primal Mama , specifically the "friction" caused by the meat oligarchy. His identity is forged in the loss of his family' s legacy, his craft, and his economic independence, all sacrificed to the relentless expansion of centralized power. His Functional skills (alligator  processing, swamp knowledge) are now largely negated by his Economic and Social limitations imposed by the oligarchy. His Psychological state (resent ment, weariness, wounded pride) is a direct consequence of this victimization. He represents the human face of Lickskillet' s struggle against the faceless power of entities that likely have ties to Beetriot's elite, all within the constraints of a world  that demands adherence to a specific 1970s technological aesthetic, potentially weaponized by the powerful to consolidate control .
    Primary_Narrative_Function: |
      To serve as a poignant example of the injustices prevalent in Primal  Mama; to be a potential catalyst or source of information for protagonists seeking to understand or challenge the meat oligarchy; to  ground the world's economic and power dynamics in tangible human suffering; to highlight the vulnerability of "mom-and- pop" operations and traditional ways of life against systemic exploitation.
    Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: | 
      Wounded Pride vs. Crushing Resignation; Desire for Justice/Recognition vs. Fear of Retaliation ; Loyalty to Lost Traditions/Craft vs. The Impossibility of Practicing Them; The Memory of Prosperity vs. The Daily  Grind of Poverty.
    Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle: |
      Could be galvanized into action  by a new hope or opportunity (Social/Relational change). Might share his vital knowledge (Functional/Epistemic  change) with those who could use it against the oligarchy. Could find a new, albeit smaller, purpose (Psychological change).  Or, could sink further into despair, serving as a tragic warning (Psychological/Social decline). His story could involve reclaiming some small  measure of dignity or agency, even if full restoration is impossible.
