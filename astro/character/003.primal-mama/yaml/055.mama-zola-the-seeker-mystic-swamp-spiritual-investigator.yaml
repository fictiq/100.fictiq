   Character_Constitution_Summary_Narrative_Function:
    Core_Essence: |
      Mama Zola is constituted  as a figure of profound spiritual inquiry existing on the fringes of Primal Mama's dominant culture. Her identity is rooted  in a unique blend of ancestral wisdom (African-derived, adapted to the swamp) and a relentless, almost scientific,  personal quest to "experimentally" verify the true nature of divinity and the spiritual laws of her bizarre world. She rejects  the superficiality of the celebrity gods and the perceived limitations of mainstream Swamp Witchery, seeking a deeper, more fundamental "Primal Source ." Her Physical presence is one of aged dignity and attunement to nature; her Functional abilities lie in deep ecological knowledge  and unorthodox ritualism; her Psychological drive is an unwavering, patient search for ultimate truth. Socially, she is an outsider, yet  her wisdom provides a unique Axiological value to those who seek her.
    Primary_Narrative_Function: | 
      To embody an alternative spiritual path within Primal Mama; to act as a source of deep, unconventional wisdom and lore ; to potentially guide protagonists towards understanding less obvious truths about the world, the Calamity, or the nature of entities  like Erpenthropes or ghosts; to demonstrate that "finding God" in Primal Mama is a deeply personal and  potentially perilous experiment.
    Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: |
      The drive for solitary, profound  truth vs. the subtle need for connection/sharing knowledge; the limitations of her mortal lifespan against the vastness of her  quest; interpreting the often ambiguous or dangerous "results" of her spiritual experiments; navigating the fine line between seeker and " crazy swamp lady" in the eyes of others.
    Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle: | 
      Uncovering a significant piece of hidden lore about the Calamity or the "Primal Source" through her  experiments (Epistemic/Historical change); forming an unexpected alliance with an Erpenthrope or a character seeking similar  truths (Social/Relational change); her knowledge becoming crucial to resolving a larger crisis; facing a direct challenge from established  spiritual powers (Swamp Witches, devout followers of celebrity gods) or those who misunderstand/fear her work.
