# Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually
# This protocol guides  the detailed definition of Fictional Persons (characters, significant sentient beings)
# within the Primal Mama heteroc osm. Following Doležel's framework, characters ARE constituted by the
# bundle of properties authenticated for them by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives).
# They possess no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition.
# Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across
# relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises  from the richness,
# coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle, and whose actions are logically
# grounded in their  defined nature and the world's rules. Remember undersaturation: define what is essential,
# acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined .

  Character_Constitution_Summary_Narrative_Function:
    Purpose: "Synt hesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    Core_Essence : |
      Jebediah Washington is constituted as a living testament to the destructive power of unsubstantiated belief and mob  justice within Primal Mama. His identity is forged in the crucible of false accusation related to the "Invisible Women" conspiracy , stripping him of his livelihood, dignity, and social existence. His Physical deterioration mirrors his Psychological scarring (bitterness, paranoia,  resignation). His Functional limitations are direct consequences of his Social ostracization and the historical trauma he endured. He is a man whose knowledge  of the swamp's truths (practical survival) is rendered useless by the societal "truths" (conspiracy beliefs)  that condemned him. He embodies the tragic intersection of Primal Mama's epistemic frailties (the power of conspiracy ) and its deontic harshness (summary, irreversible social punishment).
    Primary_Narrative_Function: | 
      Serves as a potent example of the human cost of Primal Mama's societal fears and superstitions (specifically  the "Invisible Women" conspiracy). He can act as a cautionary figure, a source of grim firsthand information for a protagonist investigating such  phenomena, or a moral challenge (can he be helped? Is redemption/justice possible for him in this world?). His  existence highlights the fragility of truth and status in the face of widespread, weaponized belief.
    Key_Internal_Conflicts_From _Bundle: |
      Survival instinct vs. utter despair; Lingering bitterness vs. profound weariness; Fear of others vs.  a deeply buried longing for justice or acknowledgement; The man he was vs. the broken shell he has become.
    Potential _for_Development_Based_on_Bundle: |
      His arc could involve: a protagonist slowly earning his trust, leading  him to share his story (Epistemic change for protagonist, psychological release for Jeb); a desperate attempt to help him  (testing Axiological and Deontic limits of the society); him finding a small measure of peace or purpose, even if justice  remains elusive; or, conversely, his final succumbing to despair or further persecution.
