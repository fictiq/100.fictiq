  CharacterConstitutionSummaryAndNarrativeFunction:
    Purpose: " Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    CoreEssence: | 
      [Jengo Mabayo is constituted as a living testament to the human cost of Primal Mama's retro-futuristic  bio-industrial complex. His identity is forged in the tension between his deep-rooted ancestral connection to the swamp (Physical , Functional, Psychological, Historical properties) and the brutal, impersonal efficiency of the GE alligator meat oligarchy that has dis possessed him (Social, Functional limitations, Axiological devaluation). He is a repository of lost knowledge and suppressed grief, forced  to participate in the very system that destroyed his way of life. His African features and cultural heritage mark him as part of a specific,  historically marginalized community within the broader Primal Mama society, highlighting themes of cultural erasure alongside economic exploitation.]
    PrimaryNarrativeFunction : |
      [To embody the plight of the common worker and traditional communities crushed by the oligarchy; to provide a ground- level perspective on life in Lickskillet and the consequences of the world's core economic system; to serve as a potential  moral compass, reluctant informant, or catalyst for a protagonist interacting with the injustices of Primal Mama. His victimhood is  a direct result of the world's established Deontic (oligarchy power) and Alethic (GE gator dominance ) modalities.]
    KeyInternalConflicts: |
      [The daily struggle to maintain dignity and provide for his granddaughter  versus the soul-crushing nature of his labor and the constant reminders of what has been lost; The desire for justice  or even revenge against the faceless oligarchy versus the practical impotence of his position and fear of reprisal; The internal  battle to preserve ancestral memory and identity in a world that actively devalues and erases it.]
    PotentialForDevelopment:  |
      [Could be radicalized by a specific event or charismatic figure; might find an unexpected way to use his  "obsolete" traditional knowledge against the oligarchy or to help others survive; could be pushed to a breaking point leading to  open defiance or a desperate act; might form an unlikely alliance (e.g., with an Erpenthrope also  wary of the oligarchies, or a sympathetic outsider). His knowledge of old swamp ways could become crucial if the GE-systems falter .]
