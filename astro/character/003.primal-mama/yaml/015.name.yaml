  Character_Constitution_ Summary_And_Narrative_Function:
    Purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    Core_Essence: >-
      Pastor Jebediah Jones is  constituted as a beacon of traditional Christian faith and morality weathering the storm of Primal Mama's bizarre, post-Calam ity reality.
      His being is defined by an unwavering belief in a benevolent, though mysterious, God who provides (even if that  provision is solar-powered alligators) and judges
      (as seen in the Calamity and the prohibition on cattle flesh –  a reminder of past sins or a necessary new covenant). He interprets the world's strangeness—Erpenthropes ,
      celebrity deities, 1970s tech—through this theological lens, offering his Lickskillet flock  (and any who will listen) a framework of hope, resilience, and enduring moral values.
      He embodies the persistence  of faith against overwhelming cultural and even biological shifts.
    Primary_Narrative_Function: >-
      To  serve as a moral compass and a source of spiritual solace/interpretation within Lickskillet. To represent a contrasting belief  system to the celebrity cults and secular pragmatism.
      To offer a humanistic (faith-based) perspective  on the world's more bizarre elements (Erpenthropes, ghosts). He can be a source of wisdom, a  voice of caution against societal excesses
      (like the "Invisible Women" conspiracy or oligarchy greed), and a catalyst for community  action rooted in compassion.
    Key_Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle:
      - "Maintaining unwavering hope amidst pervasive weird ness and hardship."
      - "Reconciling ancient scripture with current realities (e.g., vampire bunnies,  \"death by burger\" law)."
      - "Resisting the allure of simplistic answers (conspiracies, celebrity  worship) for his flock."
      - "Grappling with the problem of suffering in a world so clearly \"touched\" by  transformative events."
      - "Deciding how to engage with those outside his faith (e.g., Erp enthropes, Swamp Witches, celebrity cultists) – with condemnation, compassion, or cautious outreach?"
     Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle:
      - "Deepening his theological understanding of Primal  Mama's unique phenomena."
      - "Facing a direct challenge to his faith from a powerful supernatural entity or a charismatic  celebrity cult leader."
      - "Being forced to make difficult moral choices that test his principles (e.g., collaborating  with an Erpenthrope for a greater good)."
      - "Expanding his ministry or facing its persecution."
       - "Becoming a more vocal critic of the meat oligarchy or Beetriot's excesses, potentially facing repercussions."
