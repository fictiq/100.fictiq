    Physical_Properties:
      # Purpose: Define the character' s tangible presence.
      Appearance_General: Human male, late 50s but meticulously maintained. Stocky, imposing  build, often looks like he's about to burst out of his expensive, tailored suits. Hairpiece impeccably co iffed in a 1970s power style. # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Visual Style  inferred from 70s Aesthetic]
      Appearance_Specific_Features: Ruddy complexion, fleshy face with small , shrewd eyes. A smile that rarely reaches his eyes, often more a baring of teeth. Prominent gold rings  on several fingers. # Auth: [Visual Concept]
      Appearance_Distinctive_Marks: A faint, almost  invisible scar along his jawline, rumored to be from "early business negotiations." Wears a solid gold alligator tooth pendant.  # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Alligator Meat economy]
      Typical_Attire: Custom-tailored leisure  suits in shades of brown, mustard, or avocado green, always with a wide, patterned tie. Polished alligator- skin boots (non-GE, "vintage pre-calamity" if he can get them, or highest- grade GE otherwise, a subtle display of dominance over the primary resource). Often seen with a chunky, gold-plated " communicator" (styled like a 70s CB radio handset) that connects to his private network. # Auth: [ Primal Mama Codex - 1970s Tech Aesthetic & Alligator Meat Economy]
      Voice_Speech_Pattern : Smooth, honeyed baritone with a pronounced, folksy Southern drawl when public-facing, which can turn sharp and  menacing in private. Master of the backhanded compliment and veiled threat. # Auth: [Dialogue Concept]
      G ait_Mannerisms: Confident, slightly swaggering gait. Expansive gestures. Habit of patting people on the  back a little too hard. Constantly adjusting his tie or shooting his cuffs. # Auth: [Action Description]
       Associated_Scent_If_Any: Expensive, slightly overpowering 1970s-style cologne, cigar  smoke (even if not actively smoking), and the faint, underlying metallic tang of Beetriot industry. # Auth: [ Sensory Palette]
      Physical_Undersaturation: Exact height/weight; specific brand of hairpiece; details of his  private security force's appearance.

Privately, may have a clandestine, heavily  secured (and 1970s-aesthetic-camouflaged) data analysis unit using LLM principles for  economic forecasting or social control modeling, its existence a deeply guarded secret. # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - De ontic: Automaton/LLM User Stigma + Tyrant Hypocrisy Trope]

        - Property_ID: N/A

    Axiological_Properties:
      # Purpose: Define the character's value status *within * Primal Mama.
      Reputation_Beetriot_Elite: Authenticated as 'strong', 'dec isive', 'necessary evil', 'good for business' by his allies and beneficiaries. Feared by potential rivals. #  Auth: [Inferred social dynamics]
      Reputation_Beetriot_Populace: Mixed; some genuinely  buy into his folksy strongman image and cult of personality (especially if they benefit or are propagandized); many fear him  and feel oppressed but powerless. # Auth: [Tyrant dynamic]

    Historical_ Properties:
      # Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.
      Origin:  Authenticated as rising from obscurity in the chaotic decades following the Biological Calamity. Possibly a ruthless opportunist in the early  days of the GE alligator trade, consolidating power through brutal takeovers and political maneuvering. Official histories are heavily sanitized. # Auth: [ Primal Mama Codex - History: Calamity Aftermath]
      Key_Past_Event_Connection_Authenticated : Architect of the "Beetriot Accords" which solidified the meat oligarchy's power and formalized the city's  dominance over regional alligator harvesting, effectively institutionalizing his control. # Auth: [Fictional Historical Event]
       Inherited_Items_Positions: Leveraged connections and ill-gotten gains to secure the Mayorship, which he  has held for an unusually long tenure through manipulated elections and suppression of dissent. # Auth: [Narrative Backstory] 
      Historical_Undersaturation: Specific details of his early crimes; the identities of his first backers or victims; any  pre-calamity history (likely expunged or irrelevant).

  character_constitution_summary_narrative _function:
    # Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated  property bundle.
    Core_Essence: Mayor Beau Laveau is constituted as the personification of Primal Mama's  urban decay and corrupt power, a tyrant ruling Beetriot through a carefully crafted 1970s charismatic facade that  masks profound greed, paranoia, and ruthlessness. He controls the city's economic lifeblood (alligator meat processing , solar power distribution) and maintains his grip via propaganda, a loyal security force, and the exploitation of the Deontic (cattle  laws, Automaton stigma) and Axiological (70s aesthetic, perhaps even manipulating reverence for deified celebrities) systems of  the world. His ownership of priceless artifact cattle is the ultimate symbol of his decadent power.
    Primary_Narrative _Function: Antagonist. Represents systemic oppression and corruption. He is the face of the forces seeking to control and exploit the world' s resources and people, particularly those in Lickskillet and the independent swamp communities. He serves as a major obstacle  to any protagonists seeking freedom, truth (especially Erpenthropes), or equitable existence.
    Key_Internal _Conflicts_From_Bundle: Maintaining his populist image vs. his despotic actions. Fear of exposure of his clandestine activities (e .g., LLM use). Paranoia about losing control to rivals, swamp elements, or popular uprising. The psychological dissonance of demanding  adherence to a 1970s aesthetic while secretly desiring ever more advanced (hidden) tools of control.
     Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle: His downfall through exposure or rebellion. Escalation of his tyranny  in response to threats. Being outmaneuvered by Erpenthropes' pursuit of truth or Swamp Witches' esoteric  power. His paranoia leading to self-destructive decisions. A potential (though unlikely) shift if faced with a threat great  enough to require uneasy alliances.
