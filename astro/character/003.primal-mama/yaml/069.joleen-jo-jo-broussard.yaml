Character_Constitution_Summary_Narrative_Function:
   Purpose: 'Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.'
  Core_Ess ence: 'Jo-Jo Broussard is constituted as a quintessential Lickskillet citizen: a resilient, pragmatic  small business owner deeply enmeshed in the alligator-based economy and the pervasive 1970s technological and cultural aesthetic  of Primal Mama. Her identity is forged by her family''s history in the bayou, her daily struggle against  the encroaching meat oligarchies, and her steadfast adherence to local values, including a genuine faith in the deified Southern  celebrities. She is a product of the post-Calamity world, her life dictated by its unique rules – from  the necessity of solar power to the cultural taboo of cattle consumption and the social stigma of LLMs (which she avoids).' 
  Primary_Narrative_Function: 'To serve as a viewpoint character representing the everyday struggles and resilience of Lickskillet ''s independent populace. She can embody the "mom-and-pop" resistance to oligarchical control, showcase the practical implications  of the world''s core rules (1970s tech, solar reliance, gator economy), and act as a  conduit for local lore, superstitions (Invisible Women), and cultural expressions (celebrity worship, festivals).'
  Key_ Internal_Conflicts_From_Bundle: 'Maintaining independence vs. economic annihilation by oligarchies; Upholding tradition ( including 70s aesthetic/methods) vs. the pressure to adopt more ''efficient'' (and likely oligarchy-controlled)  methods; Community solidarity vs. individual survival instincts; Pragmatism vs. a weary adherence to her belief in "fairness " in a world stacked against her.'
  Potential_for_Development_Based_on_Bundle: 'Could be pushed  to become a reluctant leader of local resistance; forced to make morally grey choices to save her business (e.g., dealing  with shadier elements, considering ''forbidden'' tech if desperate); might uncover information related to the oligarchies or even local manifestations of  the supernatural (ghosts, witches) if her problems deepen; her faith in the deified celebrities or conspiracies could be challenged  or reinforced by events.'
