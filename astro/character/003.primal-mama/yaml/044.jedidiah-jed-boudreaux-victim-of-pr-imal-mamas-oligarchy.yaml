Introduction:
  purpose: "This protocol guides the detailed definition  of Fictional Persons (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters ARE constituted by the bundle of properties authenticated for them by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess no  independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition."
  usage_note: "Use this template to systematically build characters by  explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the richness, coherence, and  potential tensions within their authenticated bundle, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules.  Remember undersaturation: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined."

  CharacterConstitutionSummary:
    purpose: "Synthesize the core identity , internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle."
    CoreEssence: "Jedidiah Boudreaux  is constituted as a living consequence of Primal Mama's brutal economic realities, specifically the \"friction\" generated by the Meat  Processor Oligarchy (GatorBaron Conglomerate). His Physical weathering, Functional limitations (post-ruin), and  Psychological bitterness are direct results of his Historical victimization. His Social isolation is a product of this trauma, clashing with his former  pride in his Lickskillet community standing and adherence to its Axiological values (honest work, self-reliance,  1970s aesthetic craftsmanship). He represents the human cost of unchecked power in a world struggling to balance tradition, necessity, and  technological advancement within a rigid aesthetic and peculiar spiritual miasma."
    PrimaryNarrativeFunction: "To embody the plight of the  common person in Lickskillet under the heel of the oligarchy; to serve as a potential catalyst or reluctant participant in any  resistance; to provide an intimate, ground-level view of the world's socio-economic struggles and the value system (e. g., pride in gun ownership, distrust of impersonal corporations) prevalent outside Beetriot. He can be a source of information  on the oligarchy's methods and a moral touchstone."
    KeyInternalConflicts: "Resentment vs . Fear of Retaliation; Pride in Past Self-Sufficiency vs. Current Dependence/Despair; Desire for Justice vs . Overwhelming Power of the Oligarchy; Trust in Traditional Ways vs. Realization of Their Vulnerability."
    Potential ForDevelopment: "Jed could be pushed to seek help from unconventional sources (e.g., an Erpenthrope seeking  truth about the Conglomerate, or even a Swamp Witch if desperate enough). He might find a new purpose in protecting others from a  similar fate, slowly rebuilding his trust and finding new skills or alliances. Conversely, he could sink further into bitterness or become a target  for manipulation due to his desperation or desire for revenge. His knowledge of old gator ways and 1970 s tech could become unexpectedly valuable."
