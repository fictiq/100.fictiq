introduction : |
  This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the  Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties  authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.
  Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating  multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions  are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential,  acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.

  character_constitution_summary_narrative_function: 
    purpose: "Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle." 
    core_essence: |
      Remi "Gatorbait" Dubois is constituted as a living testament to the harsh  socio-economic realities of Primal Mama's Lickskillet region. He is a man whose identity and skills, once sources  of pride and sustenance (traditional alligator farming), have been rendered obsolete and worthless by the overwhelming power of the meat oligarchy. His  Physical being reflects his past labor and current despair. His Psychological state is a cauldron of resentment, grief, and wounded pride, fueling  a deep-seated internal conflict between resignation and a desperate, flickering desire for justice or meaning. He embodies the human cost of the " friction" caused by powerful entities in a world striving to maintain a veneer of 1970s-era stability  over a foundation of biotech and disparity.
    primary_narrative_function: |
      To serve as a poignant example  of the victims created by the dominant power structures (meat oligarchy) in Primal Mama; to provide a ground-level perspective on  life in Lickskillet; to potentially act as a moral compass or catalyst for a protagonist who might encounter him;  to illustrate the consequences of the world's deontic and axiological imbalances.
    key_internal_conflicts: | 
      Resentment vs. Fear of Reprisal; Pride in Lost Heritage vs. Shame of Current Impotence; Desire  for Justice/Revenge vs. Crushing Despair; Loyalty to "Old Ways" vs. Inability to Compete  in the New Order.
    potential_for_development: |
      Remi could be galvanized into action (perhaps  rashly) if an opportunity for minor rebellion or symbolic justice arises. He might find a new, albeit lesser, purpose helping  others in similar straits. Conversely, he could slide further into alcoholism or complete despondency. His deep swamp knowledge (Functional Property ) might become unexpectedly valuable in a crisis, offering a path to reclaiming some self-worth.
