## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of  **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole žel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the ** richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and  the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

###  Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)* 

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence .*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Male, late 50s, with strong, weathered African  features. Once powerfully built from years of swamp work, now carries himself with a slump, frame thinned by hardship.]` #  Auth: [Primal Mama Visual Palette - Lickskillet Denizens]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features:  [Rich dark skin, flecked with lighter patches from sun and swamp exposure. Deep-set, tired brown eyes.  A once-full beard and close-cropped hair are now heavily streaked with grey, almost white at the temples.  Prominent brow and a broad, slightly flattened nose.]` # Auth: [Narrative Description Concept]
    *    `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [A long, jagged scar runs from his left temple down his cheek, partially obscured by  his beard – a souvenir from a 'gator that got too close. His right hand is gnarled, fingers  permanently crooked from a poorly healed break – an "accident" at the Consolidated GatorCorp processing line.]` # Auth: [Back story Event Link]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Faded, patched-up canvas overalls (once  a vibrant bayou-brown, now sun-bleached and stained), worn over a threadbare, dark-colored thermal  shirt. Heavy, cracked rubber boots, perpetually caked in dried mud. Sometimes wears a wide-brimmed hat  made of woven swamp reeds, frayed at the edges.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence - Lickskillet Common  Attire]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Deep baritone, once resonant with laughter and confidence , now often quiet, laced with a weary bitterness. Speaks with a distinct Lickskillet bayou drawl. Pr one to muttering prayers or curses under his breath to "Smokey" (Burt Reynolds) or "The Snow man" (Jerry Reed).]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence - Deified Celebrities / Regional Dialects ]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Slow, deliberate movements, favoring his right side due to the hand  injury. Often stares off into the middle distance, lost in thought. Wrings his good hand when agitated. Once had  a proud, upright posture; now walks with his shoulders hunched.]` # Auth: [Observation Notes]
    *    `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Swamp mud, stale sweat, alligator musk (faintly,  from past life), and the faint, acrid smell of industrial cleaning agents from his brief, disastrous stint at the processing  plant.]` # Auth: [Sensory Palette - Lickskillet]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation:  [Exact height/weight, specific childhood illnesses, detailed dental records.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities &  Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*

     *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Mangled right hand severely limits manual labor, especially tasks requiring grip strength or fine motor  skills like skinning or engine repair. Chronic back pain from past labor and recent "accidents".]` # Auth: [Physical  Property Link]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Lacks understanding of Beetriot's complex legal or  financial systems that were used against him. Unaware of the true extent of the meat oligarchy's influence until it was too late .]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence - Deontic/Epistemic Disparities]
     *   `- Limitation (Social/Economic): [No capital, no equipment, reputation smeared by Consolidated GatorCorp ("un reliable," "prone to accidents"). Lives on the fringes of Lickskillet society, relying on meagre charity or scavenging .]` # Auth: [Current Situation]
    *   `- Limitation (Technological): [Distrustful and  unskilled with Automatons/LLMs, even if they weren't stigmatized; his world was hands-on.] ` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence - Automaton Stigma]

    *   `- Key Belief (Current): ["The whole damn system's rigged  by them Beetriot fat-cats and their GatorCorp cronies." "Even the spirits of the swamp can't protect  you from greed." Questions his faith in the deified celebrities.]` # Auth: [Dialogue, Cynical Outlook]

        *   *Description:* `Jeb Dubois operates entirely under the established ale thic, deontic, axiological, and epistemic modalities of Primal Mama. His victimhood is a result  of these modalities being exploited by more powerful entities, not from any unique exception he possesses.`
        *   *Limits :* `N/A`

Children might see  him as a bogeyman or a sad, broken old man.]` # Auth: [Community Dialogue/Interactions]
     *   `- Reputation (Swamp Witches/Fringe Elements): [Potentially seen as someone 'touched by misfortune ', possibly vulnerable to their influence or, conversely, too broken to be of interest. Some may pity his loss of connection  to the 'true' swamp.]` # Auth: [World Group Attitudes]

    *    `- Key Past Event Connection: [The "Consolidated GatorCorp Squeeze" of Year '78 (relative  to current narrative timeline): A period where the meat oligarchy systematically bankrupted, bought out, or violently suppressed independent alligator  harvesters in the Lickskillet region. Jeb was a prominent holdout and thus a primary target.]` #  Auth: [Specific World Event]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize  the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:**  `Jebediah Dubois is constituted as a living testament to the brutal socio-economic realities of Primal Mama,  specifically the crushing power of the meat oligarchy (Consolidated GatorCorp) in places like Lickskillet. His Physical  (mangled hand, weathered appearance), Functional (loss of skills, inability to work), and Psychological (grief, resentment,  broken pride) properties are direct consequences of his victimhood under the world's Deontic (exploitative corporate practices ) and Axiological (devaluation of independent labor) systems. His history is one of decline from respected self-sufficiency  to marginalized despair, a direct result of the "Consolidated GatorCorp Squeeze." He is a man whose connection to the traditional , solar-powered, 1970s-aesthetic bayou life has been severed.`
*   ** Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a poignant example of the human cost of the oligarchy's dominance; to provide a  personal face to the "friction" mentioned in the Coherence Protocol; to potentially act as a catalyst for other characters ( e.g., inspiring pity, a desire for justice, or serving as a cautionary tale); to embody the fading spirit  of Lickskillet's independent past; to potentially seek aid from or offer crucial information to protagonists about the olig archy's methods or the swamp's hidden dangers.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Pride  vs. Need (struggling to accept his fall and dependency); Hope vs. Despair (a flicker of desire  for justice against overwhelming odds); Memory of Strength vs. Reality of Weakness (the ghost of his former self haunting his  present incapacitation); Faith (in old ways/deities) vs. Bitter Disillusionment.`
*   ** Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Finding a new, albeit different, purpose (e.g., storyteller, keeper  of lost swamp lore); becoming a reluctant voice for the downtrodden if galvanized; succumbing further to bitterness and becoming  a tool for darker elements; or finding a measure of peace/acceptance. His knowledge of old swamp ways (Functional/ Historical) could become unexpectedly valuable.`
