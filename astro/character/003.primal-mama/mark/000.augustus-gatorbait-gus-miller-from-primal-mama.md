# Story World Codex:  Fictional Person Constitution Protocol
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character  as Property Bundle)

**World:** Primal Mama
**Codex Version:** 0.1 - Character Constitution 
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional  Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters  **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives).  They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly  authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions  within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**:  define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity,  internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Gatorbait Gus is constituted  as an embodiment of the resilient, struggling working class of Primal Mama's Lickskillet. His existence is defined  by the GE Alligator economy, the constraints of the 1970s tech aesthetic, and the oppressive weight of the Meat  Oligarchy. His Functional skills are tied directly to this swamp-based, retro-tech life. Psychologically, he is  a pragmatist clinging to independence, whose values (self-reliance, suspicion of authority, a touch of celebrity worship for " The Snowman" Jerry Reed) are forged by his environment and social standing. He is a product of the post-Calam ity world, a living testament to its strange blend of advanced biotech and mandated retro-simplicity.`
*   ** Primary Narrative Function:** `Ground-level viewpoint character illustrating the everyday realities, struggles, and cultural nuances of Lickskillet and  the alligator trade. Can serve as a reluctant ally, a source of local information, or a representation of the human cost of  the Oligarchy's power. Embodies the theme of autonomy vs. oppressive systems within Primal Mama's unique context .`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Need for economic survival vs. desire for true independence from the Olig archy. Adherence to practical, observable reality vs. ingrained local superstitions/folk beliefs regarding Swamp Witches or the deeper  swamp. Pride in his craft vs. the demeaning treatment by more powerful entities.`
*   **Potential for Development ( Based on Bundle):** `Could be pushed into more active resistance against the Oligarchy (Social/Relational change). Might  be forced to seek aid from distrusted sources (e.g., a Swamp Witch, an Automaton user, even  an Erpenthrope if desperate enough), challenging his Psychological biases. Could learn new, unconventional ways to adapt his  1970s tech to gain an edge (Functional change). Discovery of some local secret or encountering a direct manifestation of the supernatural  could drastically alter his Epistemic framework.`
