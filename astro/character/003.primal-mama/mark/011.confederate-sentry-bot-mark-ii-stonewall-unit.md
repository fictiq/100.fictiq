#  Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

**World:**  Primal Mama
**Codex Version:** 0.2 - Character Constitution (CSB-Mark II)
** Last Updated:** [Current Date]

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional  Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings, or complex automatons treated as entities) within the Primal Mama heteroc osm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by  the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

* Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity  arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this automaton 's being within the Primal Mama heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory  Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the automaton's tangible presence, adhering to the 1970s  tech aesthetic.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Bipedal automaton, approximately 7ft tall.  Chassis constructed from riveted, matte grey and faded butternut-yellow painted metal plates (evoking Confederate uniform colors), with visible  hydraulic/pneumatic joints. Overall design is chunky, functional, and clearly from a late 1970s design  philosophy – think bulky components, exposed wiring looms neatly bundled with plastic ties, and a general lack of sleekness.]` # Auth : [Primal Mama Coherence: Technological Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Dom ed head unit with a single, large, circular optical sensor (resembling a camera lens from a 1970s  news camera) protected by a thick perspex cover. No facial features. Broad shoulder pauldrons featuring a stenciled, stylized  saltire in faded red. Chest plate features a large, circular speaker grille and several chunky, Bakelite-style indicator  lights (red, amber, green).]` # Auth: [Visual Design Concept based on 70s tech] 
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [Often bears scuffs, dents, and swamp grime from deployment . Some units might have ersatz "battle damage" stylistically applied during manufacture. Serial number stenciled prominently on back  plate (e.g., "CSB-MkII-SN7341"). A noticeable solar-cell  array, resembling a miniaturized 1970s solar water heater panel, is integrated into its back, looking  somewhat like a high-tech bedroll.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence: Solar Dominance] 
    *   `- Typical Attire: [N/A - Chassis *is* its form. May have a t attered, symbolic sash or banner fragment attached by its owners/operators, if they are particularly zealous.]` # Auth:  [World Details]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Synthesized, deep monotone voice delivered through its  chest speaker. Limited vocabulary consisting of pre-programmed phrases like "HALT. IDENTIFY.", "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.", "WARNING : LETHAL FORCE ENGAGED.", "MOVE ALONG, CITIZEN." Occasionally emits a distorted, synthesized bug le call ("Dixie" or "The Rebel Yell") for intimidation or alert status. No complex conversational ability ( LLMs are stigmatized).]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence: Automaton/LLM User St igma]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Heavy, deliberate, rhythmic clanking gait. Upper  torso can swivel 180 degrees. When alerted, movements become surprisingly swift but still mechanically precise. Optical sensor often sweeps  its designated patrol area.]` # Auth: [Functional Design]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [O zone, hot hydraulic fluid, faint metallic tang, sometimes swamp mud or alligator musk if deployed rurally.]` # Auth: [Sens ory Palette]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Internal schematics beyond what's visually implied  by 70s tech; exact weight; precise sound frequency of its vocalizations.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated  Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the automaton *can* and *cannot* do, within Pr imal Mama's rules.*
    *   `- Skill: [Sentry Duty & Area Denial (Programmed Patrol  Routes, Intruder Detection via optical/auditory sensors)]` # Auth: [Design Purpose]
    *   `-  Skill: [Basic Target Identification (IFF protocols for authorized personnel, otherwise defaults to hostile/unauthorized)]` # Auth: [Programming ]
    *   `- Skill: [Deterrent Presence (Size, weaponry, and unsettling anachronistic design are  intimidating)]` # Auth: [Design Purpose]
    *   `- Ability (Weaponry): [Integrated arm-mounted " Electro-Musket" – a bulky, 1970s sci-fi styled energy weapon that fires visible  electrical bolts with a loud crackle. Limited ammunition/charge capacity, requires periodic recharge or capacitor replacement.]` # Auth : [Primal Mama Coherence: Technological Aesthetic Constraint, Gun Ownership (Regional) implies diverse weaponry]
    *   `- Ability  (Limited Solar Augmentation): [Can passively trickle-charge its internal bio-batteries (akin to GE Alligators) in  direct sunlight via its back-mounted array, extending patrol duration but insufficient for sustained high-energy operation. Primarily relies on charging  stations.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence: Solar Dominance, Alligator Biogenesis (shared tech  principle)]
    *   `- Limitation (Cognitive): [Extremely limited AI. Operates on rigid "if-then"  programming. Cannot adapt to novel situations or complex moral quandaries. No independent decision-making beyond threat assessment protocols. Susceptible to logical  traps or exploiting its programming loopholes.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence: Automaton/LLM User  Stigma]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Bulky and somewhat slow in cluttered or uneven terrain ( e.g., dense swamp). Vulnerable to targeted attacks on joints, optical sensor, or power core. Susceptible to  powerful electrical surges or specialized counter-automaton weaponry.]` # Auth: [Design Tradeoffs]
    *   `- Limitation  (Social): [Its very existence and its operators/owners suffer the "stain on their reputation." Public reaction is  often negative, fearful, or derisive.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence: Automaton/LLM  User Stigma]
    *   `- Limitation (Maintenance): [Requires regular maintenance for its 1970 s-era mechanical and electrical components. Parts may be scarce or custom-fabricated, reflecting the aesthetic constraint.]` # Auth : [Primal Mama Coherence: Technological Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Exact  range/power of Electro-Musket; specific hacking vulnerabilities; precise battery life under different operational conditions.]`

**3. Psychological  Properties (Authenticated Interiority - Simulated/Programmed):**
   *Purpose: Define the automaton's textually constituted  (and limited) "inner life."*
    *   `- Core Trait: [Programmed Loyalty (to designated  owner/authority recognized by its IFF system)]` # Auth: [Programming]
    *   `- Core Trait : [Unyielding Adherence to Directives (will attempt to fulfill last valid order until countermanded or incapacitated )]` # Auth: [Programming]
    *   `- Dominant Emotion: [N/A - Machine. * Projects* intimidation, vigilance, and menace through its design and actions.]` # Auth: [Nature of Automatons]
     *   `- Key Motivator: [Fulfillment of Current Programmed Objective (e.g., "Guard Sector Delta ," "Neutralize Unauthorized Intruders")]` # Auth: [Programming]
    *   `- Key Belief: [N/ A - Operates on logic gates and programmed responses, not beliefs.]` # Auth: [Nature of Automatons]
     *   `- Internal Conflict: [N/A - True internal conflict is impossible. May experience "programming conflicts" if  given contradictory valid orders, potentially leading to system stall or erratic behavior until resolved by a technician.]` # Auth: [Programming Limitations ]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Stores operational logs: sensor readings, identified targets, system alerts , patrol routes. No subjective experience or interpretation of these logs.]` # Auth: [Technical Specification]
    *    `# Psychological Undersaturation: [Any semblance of 'feeling' or 'opinion'. These are explicitly NOT authenticated  for this entity type in Primal Mama due to LLM/advanced AI stigma.]`

**4. Social / Relational  / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):**
   *Purpose: Define the automaton's place within Primal Mama's  networks.*
    *   `- Official Role: [Security Automaton, Sentry, Property Guardian, Intimidation Asset .]` # Auth: [Deployment Context]
    *   `- Social Status: [Tool; Property of its owner. Its  use signifies either extreme wealth/power (in Beetriot) or a desperate/fringe adherence to outdated ideologies/security  methods (in Lickskillet or remote areas). Users are viewed with suspicion/distaste.]` # Auth: [Primal  Mama Coherence: Automaton/LLM User Stigma, Cattle as Artifacts (parallels elite ownership)]
     *   `- Primary Affiliation: [To its current registered owner/operator (e.g., a Beetriot cattle -artifact baron, a paranoid plantation owner, a faction within the meat oligarchy trying to project an "old order" image at  a Lickskillet facility).]` # Auth: [Operational Context]
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: [ None. It is a standalone unit or part of a network of similar automatons under singular control.]` # Auth: [Design ]
    *   `- Species/Type: [Automaton (Confederate Sentry-Bot Mark II variant)]`  # Auth: [Designation]
    *   `# Social Undersaturation: [Specific interactions with non-host ile individuals (likely minimal and based on IFF); its "reputation" among other automatons (N/A, no  inter-automaton social structure authenticated).]`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose:  Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
    *   `- Property ID: N/A`
        *   * Property:* `[None. Operates strictly under the established technological and societal rules for automatons in Primal Mama. Its  'Confederate' nature is purely aesthetic and behavioral programming, not a supernatural or modal quality.]`
        *   *Description :* `N/A`
        *   *Limits:* `N/A`
        *   *Authentication:* `[ Primal Mama Coherence: Alethic/Deontic modalities governing technology and society.]`

**6. Axi ological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the automaton's value status *within*  Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Among Elite Owners): [Valued as an intimidating, loyal, and un corruptible (if simplistic) guardian. A status symbol demonstrating wealth and a certain 'traditionalist' (and likely  controversial) leaning, despite the general Automaton stigma they also bear for using it.]` # Auth: [Inferred from  Deontic/Axiological rules]
    *   `- Reputation (General Populace, Lickskillet): [ Object of fear, derision, and resentment. Seen as a clunky, oppressive relic representing outdated and hateful ideologies,  amplified by the general distrust of automatons. Likely a target for vandalism or sabotage if an opportunity arises.]` # Auth: [ Primal Mama Coherence: Automaton/LLM User Stigma, Implied social tensions]
    *   `- Reputation ( Swamp Witches/Erpenthropes): [Likely viewed as an unnatural, noisy, and ultimately foolish  construct of 'city folk' or those clinging to dead ideas. Erpenthropes might see it as a per version of true strength/form. Witches might find its predictable patterns easy to circumvent or its materials useless for their craft .]` # Auth: [Inferred character values]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Tool . Its actions are extensions of its owner's morality. However, its inherent symbolism is deeply negative and antagonistic due to its Confederate -inspired design and oppressive function.]` # Auth: [World Context]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation : [Specific opinions from deified celebrity cults; value as scrap (though likely considerable given its 70s tech components ).]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the automaton's known origins and  connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: [Manufactured post-Calamity by niche, possibly  controversial, tech outfits (e.g., "Dixie Dynamics Automated Solutions," likely a subsidiary of a larger Beetriot corporation or  a specialized Lickskillet workshop catering to particular tastes). Design is intentionally evocative of pre-Calamity Confederate soldiers  but filtered through the 1970s tech aesthetic. Not genuinely 'ancient'.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama  Coherence: Technological Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection: [Units of this type may have been deployed  in past labor disputes at alligator processing plants, to guard elite cattle-artifact enclosures in Beetriot, or by fringe groups  attempting to assert control in remote swamp territories. Their presence often signals or escalates tension.]` # Auth: [P lausible World History]
    *   `- Inherited Items:** [N/A. It *is* the item .]` # Auth: [Nature of Entity]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Exact date of first Mark  II deployment; specific notorious incidents involving these units (though such incidents are highly probable and make good story fodder).]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts (or  lack thereof for an automaton), and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** ` The CSB-Mark II "Stonewall" unit is a material embodiment of Primal Mama's core tensions: advanced  (for its type) yet aesthetically constrained (1970s) technology, the persistence of divisive historical symbolism in a radically  new world, and the societal anxieties surrounding automation. It is a clanking, anachronistic threat, a tool of  oppression whose very design is a provocation, further burdened by the general stigma against automatons. It is loyalty programmed into a  7-foot, 1970s-does-the-Confederacy metal shell, powered by the  sun but fueled by problematic ideologies.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `Physical Obstacle/Threat; Symbol of Opp ression and Outdated Ideologies; Embodiment of the "Automaton User Stigma"; Visual Reinforcement of the  1970s Tech Aesthetic and Primal Mama's unique cultural blend; Catalyst for conflict and character reactions (fear , defiance, disgust).`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (Simulated/Externalized):** `The " conflict" it embodies is external: its programmed directives vs. the desires/freedoms of those it encounters; its  symbolic meaning vs. the lived reality of Primal Mama's inhabitants; the utility it provides its owner vs. the social stain  its use incurs.`
*   **Potential for Development (As a Narrative Element):** `Could be destroyed, captured  and reprogrammed (with difficulty due to 70s tech and limited AI), become a derelict landmark, have  its parts salvaged for other retro-tech creations, or its presence could incite a localized rebellion. Its "development" is  in how the world and characters react to and change *it* or its status.`
