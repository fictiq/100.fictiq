## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Text ually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity,  internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Jebedia h Washington is constituted as a man systematically dismantled by the socio-economic machinery of Primal Mama, specifically the predatory meat  oligarchy (GatorArch Consolidated). His Physical deterioration, Functional limitations, and Psychological despair are direct consequences of his Historical  victimization. He embodies the lived reality of Lickskillet's underclass, a stark contrast to the opulence of Beetriot  or the mythic power of Erpenthropes and Swamp Witches. His belief in conspiracies like the "invisible  women" is an Epistemically limited attempt to make sense of his crushing powerlessness. His Social isolation is nearly complete,  his primary remaining tie being the agonizing memory and faint hope for his lost daughter, Sarah.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:**  `To serve as a poignant illustration of the human cost of Primal Mama's unique societal structure and power imbalances. He  can act as an information source (revealing the ground-level tactics of the oligarchy), a moral compass point ( eliciting empathy and potentially motivating protagonists), or a catalyst for conflict if others attempt to intervene on his behalf or investigate his claims  about GatorArch and his daughter.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The crushing weight of Hop elessness vs. the father's lingering, desperate Hope for Sarah; Resentment and desire for Justice vs. debilitating  Fear of GatorArch; Residual Pride in his past self vs. the humiliating Present of his destitution.`
*   **Potential for  Development (Based on Bundle):** `His trajectory is largely downward without external intervention. However, contact with protagonists could:  reignite a spark of defiance (Psychological change), lead to him sharing crucial information (Functional shift – becoming an asset), or,  if given resources/protection, even attempting a small act of resistance or search for Sarah (Social/Functional change). Alternatively , further pressure could see him break entirely or make a fatal, desperate move.`
