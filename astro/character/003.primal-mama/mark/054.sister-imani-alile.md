## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of ** Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex,  core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters  by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness,  coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world' s rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties  constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory  Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General : [Human female, mid-40s, with a dignified bearing. Dark, rich umber skin. App ears weathered by sun and swamp air but possesses a vibrant energy.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *    `- Appearance_Specific Features: [High cheekbones, expressive dark brown eyes that seem to observe deeply. Full lips often  set in a thoughtful or gently determined expression. Hair is a mass of tightly coiled, short locs, sometimes adorned with carved  alligator teeth or polished river stones.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive  Marks: [Faint, intricate scar patterns on her forearms, resembling abstracted solar flares or water ripples – self-inf licted as part of past meditative rituals. A single, small silver stud in her left nostril, crafted to look like a miniature  alligator scale.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Practical, durable clothing dyed  in earthen tones (ochre, deep green, brown) from swamp plants. Often wears a sleeveless, long vest made  of woven reeds and recycled synthetic fibers, over a simple, long-sleeved tunic and sturdy trousers tucked into knee-high,  waterproof boots. Her garments often have subtle stitched patterns reminiscent of 1970s geometric designs, but made with natural  threads.]` # Auth: [This Codex - Visual Concept]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [ A calm, melodic alto voice. Speaks deliberately, often pausing to choose words carefully. Possesses a unique cadence, not  quite the Lickskillet drawl, hinting at a different upbringing or a conscious cultivation of speech. Sometimes incorporates resonant  hums or clicks when emphasizing a point in her more esoteric discussions.]` # Auth: [This Codex - Dialogue Direction ]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Moves with a quiet grace, whether navigating treacherous swamp terrain or a  cluttered Lickskillet market. Has a habit of tilting her head when listening intently, and her hands are often gently  clasped or making slow, deliberate gestures when she explains her ideas. Frequently observed gazing at the sun (indirectly)  or large bodies of water.]` # Auth: [This Codex - Action Description]
    *   `- Associated Scent ( If Any): [Faint aroma of sun-dried herbs, damp earth, and a subtle metallic tang from her " experimental" devices.]` # Auth: [This Codex - Sensory Palette]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [ Exact height/weight; specific details of her pre-Lickskillet life attire; full range of subtle expressions.]`

** 2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot*  do.*
    *   `- Skill: [Expert Forager & Herbalist (Swamp Ecosystem): Able to identify and  utilize a vast array of swamp plants for sustenance, minor remedies, and ritual components.]` # Auth: [Demonstrated in  local interactions]
    *   `- Skill: [Rudimentary Ritualist (Self-Taught/Syncretic): Can  perform basic cleansing rites, minor protective charms, and attempts at ghost communication, often incorporating solar alignments and natural elements. Her methods  are idiosyncratic and not aligned with established Swamp Witch lore, often involving cobbled-together devices with 1970s aesthetic components  (e.g., a "spirit-resonance tuner" with chunky dials and an analog needle display, powered by a small  solar cell).]` # Auth: [Narrative Description of her practices; Primal Mama Modalities - Spectral Interaction, Solar  Dominance, Tech Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Skill: [Keen Observation & Pattern Recognition (Applied to Spirituality ): Can spend hours observing natural phenomena (alligator behavior, light patterns on water, ghost manifestations) seeking deeper meanings and connections  to the "Divine Source" she postulates.]` # Auth: [Core aspect of her character]
    *    `- Ability (Unique - Minor): [Heightened Empathic Resonance with Environment: A subtle, intuitive sense of ecological /spiritual "disturbances" or concentrations of unusual energy in her immediate surroundings. Not overtly supernatural, more like extreme  intuitive sensitivity.]` # Auth: [Narrative cues, her own interpretations of feelings]
    *   `- Limitation ( Knowledge): [Lacks formal training in advanced science (GE, solar engineering beyond basic principles) or established esoteric traditions (Sw amp Witch high magic, Erpenthrope lore). Her knowledge is experiential, experimental, and often highly subjective.]` # Auth : [Contrast with specialized world roles]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Seen as an eccentric outsider in  Lickskillet; lacks significant influence or resources. Her pursuit is solitary, and she faces skepticism from adherents of the celebrity  gods or those focused on mundane survival.]` # Auth: [Social Status Property; Primal Mama Modalities - De ified Celebrities, Axiological values]
    *   `- Limitation (Technological): [Her "experimental devices" are crude , built from salvaged parts adhering to the 1970s aesthetic, and their efficacy is based more on her belief  and ritual focus than proven scientific principles within the Primal Mama framework. They are tools for focusing her intent.]` # Auth:  [Primal Mama Modalities - Tech Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Combat  skills (likely minimal); ability to pilot complex watercraft; detailed knowledge of Beetriot politics.]`

**3. Psychological Properties  (Authenticated Interiority):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's textually constituted inner life.*
    *   `-  Core Trait: [Profound Spiritual Yearning: A deep-seated need to understand the fundamental nature of existence and connect  with a "True Divine" beyond the authenticated celebrity gods or the transactional nature of ghost interaction.]` # Auth: [Primary  Motivator]
    *   `- Core Trait: [Intellectual Humility & Openness: Willing to consider  unconventional ideas and learn from any source (nature, ghosts, even the ravings of a drunkard if a spark of insight  is there), but also rigorously questions her own findings.]` # Auth: [Her experimental approach]
    *   `- Core Tra it: [Quiet Resilience: Faces skepticism and occasional mockery with equanimity, sustained by her inner conviction.]` # Auth: [ Interactions, persistence]
    *   `- Dominant Emotion: [A blend of focused curiosity and serene determination, occasionally  tinged with frustration at the elusiveness of her goal or the limitations of her understanding.]` # Auth: [Narrator  Descriptions]
    *   `- Key Motivator: [To "authenticate" the presence and nature of a singular, universal  Divine Source/Consciousness within the Primal Mama world, distinct from the culturally accepted deities or chaotic spectral realm.  She seeks "God's blueprint" in the reformed world.]` # Auth: [Explicit Character Goal]
     *   `- Key Belief: [The Biological Calamity, while devastating, was not an ending but a transformation that  might have stripped away illusions, potentially making the "True Divine" more accessible to those who know how to look. Bel ieves the sun's "incredible energy" is a primary manifestation of this Divine.]` # Auth: [Her philosophical  stance; Primal Mama Modalities - Calamity Aftermath, Solar Dominance]
    *   `- Internal  Conflict: [The pull of her intuitive, faith-based insights vs. her desire for some form of repeatable, observable  "evidence" (within her limited means). The isolation of her unique quest vs. a human need for community/validation . Navigating the world's absurdities while seeking ultimate meaning.]` # Auth: [Narrative tension]
    *    `- Subjective Memory Content: [Clear memories of a childhood in a small, isolated community (location vague, possibly  pre-dating current Lickskillet prominence) that held different, nature-focused spiritual beliefs. A pivotal memory of witnessing  a particularly potent (and perhaps terrifying) spectral manifestation during a community ritual, which both solidified her belief in other realities and made  her question the local elders' interpretations.]` # Auth: [Backstory Element]
    *   `# Psychological  Undersaturation: [Specifics of her early community's beliefs beyond "nature-focused"; her opinions on mundane  matters like alligator meat seasoning preferences; her views on the "invisible women" conspiracy (likely sees it as another layer of mis direction from deeper truths).]`

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):**
   *Purpose : Define the character's place within the world's networks.*
    *   `- Official Role: [None . Self-styled "Seeker of the Unseen" or "Sister" by affectation/local habit.]` # Auth : [Character Concept]
    *   `- Social Status: [Fringe Dweller / Eccentric Mystic (in  Lickskillet). Respected by a small few for her wisdom or herbal skills, mostly tolerated or ignored. Not subject  to the Automaton/LLM user stigma as she eschews such tech, but her unorthodoxy creates a different kind  of social distance.]` # Auth: [Interactions, Primal Mama Modalities - Automaton Stigma]
     *   `- Primary Affiliation: [None formal. Considers herself affiliated with "All That Is" or the "Great  Mystery."]` # Auth: [Her own pronouncements]
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations (Informal/ Potential): [Occasional barter-based interactions with Swamp Witches for rare herbs or information (approaches them with cautious  respect, seeking knowledge not power). May cautiously approach Erpenthropes if encountered, seeing them as beings potentially closer  to fundamental truths, though likely wary of their transformative nature.]` # Auth: [Plausible interactions based on world  logic]
    *   `- Key Relationship 1: [To the "Divine Source" (Abstract): Her primary,  consuming relationship is with this concept she seeks to understand and connect with.]` # Auth: [Core Motivation]
    *   `-  Key Relationship 2: [To the Lickskillet Community (Tenuous): Provides occasional herbal remedies or cryptic  advice; they provide her a place to exist on the periphery. Some children are fascinated by her stories/devices.]` # Auth : [Local Interactions]
    *   `- Key Relationship 3: [To specific Ghosts (Transactional/Observational): She  attempts to commune with ghosts not just for information, but to understand their state of being and its relation to the Divine. Some  ghosts might be drawn to her unique, non-exploitative approach.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Modalities  - Spectral Interaction]
    *   `- Species/Type: [Human (Baseline Primal Mama Strain)]` # Auth : [Default]
    *   `# Social Undersaturation: [Specific named friends or enemies within Licksk illet; detailed interactions with the meat oligarchy (likely avoids them); family ties (presumed lost or distant).]`

**5 . Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
     *   `- Property ID: MODAL-IMA-01`
        *   *Property:* `[Spiritual Att unement (Minor Epistemic/Alethic Nuance)]`
        *   *Description:* `[ Authenticated as possessing a heightened, intuitive sensitivity to ambient spiritual/otherworldly energies and their fluctuations, beyond typical human perception in  Primal Mama. This allows her to identify locations, times, or conditions more conducive to her "experiments" (e.g.,  when the "veil is thin" or "solar energies are potent"). It does not grant control or specific knowledge, merely a  refined sense of spiritual "weather."]`
        *   *Limits:* `[Passive perception; no direct power or  ability to command supernatural forces. Can be misleading if misinterpreted. Does not equate to Swamp Witch magic or Erpenthrope abilities.]` 
        *   *Authentication:* `[Narrative descriptions of her successfully finding "quiet spots" for ghost contact or  "energized zones" for solar meditation; her internal monologue reflecting these perceptions; contrast with others' obliviousness to these  subtle cues.]`

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the  character's value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet General ): [Authenticated as "that peculiar Imani woman," "the God-seeker," "a bit touched but harmless," "know s her swamp plants." Not considered a threat, nor a significant community asset by most.]` # Auth: [Local  dialogue/reactions]
    *   `- Reputation (Among few Seekers/Disenfranchised): [Authenticated as a source of  alternative wisdom, a quiet comforter, someone who "sees different."]` # Auth: [Specific character interactions]
     *   `- Reputation (Potential among orthodox Celebrity God Worshippers): [If her views became widely known or challenged dominant  beliefs, she could be seen as "blasphemous" or "dangerous," though her current obscurity protects her.]` #  Auth: [Inference from Primal Mama Axiological Modalities]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing ): [Authenticated via narrative focus as genuinely seeking profound truth and spiritual understanding for its own sake, generally benevolent and non-inter fering unless profound injustice related to her core values is witnessed.]` # Auth: [Narrator tone, character actions ]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [Her reputation in Beetriot (likely unknown); how  an Erpenthrope might value her quest; specific views from the meat oligarchy (likely irrelevant to them unless she interferes  with alligator supply).]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character' s known origins and connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as arriving in the outskirts of Licksk illet approx. 10 years prior to "current narrative time." Came from a smaller, more isolated swamp settlement ( name lost or unimportant) that was eventually subsumed by ecological changes or dispersed due to internal schism over spiritual practices following  a significant spectral event.]` # Auth: [Character Backstory Snippets]
    *   `- Key Past Event  Connection (Subjective): [The aforementioned "Significant Spectral Event" in her home community: This event (e.g.,  a mass haunting, a powerful uncontrolled manifestation) shattered her inherited belief system and ignited her personal quest for a more fundamental, less chaotic  understanding of the divine/supernatural. This event is why she distrusts unmediated, raw spectral interaction as a sole  path to truth.]` # Auth: [Internal Monologue, Core Motivation Driver]
    *   `- Inherited  Items:** [A small, smooth, dark stone she believes "holds the silence of the deep swamp"; a few faded , hand-scribed pages of her former community's nature parables, which she now reinterprets in light of her broader  search.]` # Auth: [Narrative inventory]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [The precise  nature and doctrines of her original community; specific details of the "Spectral Event"; her life between leaving her home and arriving  near Lickskillet.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize  the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:**  `Sister Imani Alile is constituted as a gentle but resolute spiritual experimentalist, an ontological detective seeking the "Divine Source  Code" of a world radically reshaped by calamity and dominated by retro-futuristic absurdity and celebrity worship. Her African  features and unique name mark her as distinct, perhaps a carrier of fragmented pre-calamity cultural echoes reinterpreted through her  personal spiritual lens. Her "experiments" – a blend of swamp folk knowledge, self-taught ritual, and cobbled-together 1 970s-aesthetic devices powered by solar faith – are her method of interrogating Primal Mama's bizarre  reality for a deeper, unifying truth. She embodies a quiet defiance against the accepted spiritual norms (celebrity gods, purely  transactional ghost contact), seeking a more profound connection that transcends the pervasive "miasma."`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:**  `To serve as a source of alternative spiritual/philosophical perspective; a potential guide or catalyst for protagonists questioning the world's established  truths; a living commentary on the nature of faith, belief, and the search for meaning in a chaotic, transformed world. Her quest  can intersect with deeper lore about the calamity, the nature of ghosts, or even the consciousness of GE Alligators or Er penthropes. She can provide unique insights or MacGuffins related to "spiritual technology" or sacred natural  sites.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The profound loneliness of her unique spiritual path vs . innate human desire for understanding/community. The drive for empirical (in her own way) "proof" of the divine vs . the necessity of faith and intuition. The tension between the beauty/order she seeks (and sometimes glimpses, especially in solar patterns  or deep nature) and the pervasive chaos/absurdity of Primal Mama. The challenge of using the "tools of  the world" (salvaged 1970s tech, swamp resources) to transcend that world's limitations .`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Making a breakthrough in her "experiments" ( e.g., a consistent method of benign spirit communication, discovery of a place of unique spiritual power). Gaining reluctant  followers or an unexpected ally (an Erpenthrope curious about her methods? A disillusioned celebrity god priest?). Her quest  leading her to an unexpected truth about the calamity or the "gods." Having to defend her beliefs or practices against more  orthodox forces.`
