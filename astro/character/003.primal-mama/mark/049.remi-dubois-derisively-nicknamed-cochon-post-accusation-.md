# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character  as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides  the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm.  Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the  **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Remi "Cochon" Dubois is constituted as an ordinary Lickskillet resident tragically ens nared by Primal Mama's most severe taboo: the prohibition of cattle consumption. His identity is defined by his  wrongful accusation, the subsequent physical and psychological trauma, and his utter powerlessness against the overwhelming force of Beetriot's justice  system. He embodies the brutal consequences of the world's foundational laws when misapplied or exploited, transforming from a functional  member of his society into a reviled pariah. His African features are an incidental descriptor of his person, while his suffering  is a direct result of Primal Mama's unique societal structure and values.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:**  `To serve as a stark illustration of the human cost of Primal Mama's core tenets and the potential for injustice  within its system. He can act as a catalyst for another character's actions (e.g., an investigator,  a moral dissenter, an Erpenthrope truth-seeker). His plight can expose the cruelty underlying the retro-fut uristic, bio-punk veneer, particularly the chasm between the elite (Beetriot) and the common folk (Lick skillet) when faced with the ultimate transgression.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Hope  for truth/vindication vs. crushing despair and resignation; terror of death/torture vs. remembered pride/dignity;  confusion at the injustice vs. the undeniable reality of his condemnation.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle): ** `While his situation is dire, potential developments could include: being rescued or given a chance to tell his story by  an outside party; a desperate escape attempt (likely futile); further psychological deterioration; or becoming a symbol (martyr) if  his innocence is posthumously suspected or revealed. Any positive development hinges on external intervention, given his authenticated limitations.`
