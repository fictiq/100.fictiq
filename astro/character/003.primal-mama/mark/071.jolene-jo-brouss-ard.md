## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional  Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex,  core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters  by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness,  coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world' s rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle: 

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1.  Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *    `- Appearance_General: [Human female, appears early 40s, sturdy build from physical labor. Sun- weathered skin, with laugh lines around her eyes and mouth that can quickly turn firm. Dark, curly hair usually tied  back in a practical scarf or under a wide-brimmed, woven plant-fiber hat.]` # Auth:  [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - General citizen appearance norms]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [ Hazel eyes, quick to observe. A slightly crooked nose, memento of a youthful mishap with a runaway airboat. Strong , capable hands.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [A  faded, jagged scar on her left forearm from a juvenile gator snap – a common "Lickskillet kiss."  Several smaller, well-healed nicks and cuts on her hands and arms, typical of her profession.]` # Auth : [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Swamp life hazards]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [D urable, patched denim overalls or sturdy canvas trousers in earthy tones (brown, dark green), often worn over a plaid flannel shirt  (sleeves rolled up) or a simple, sweat-wicked cotton top. Heavy-duty, waterproof work boots.  Clothing adheres to a functional, somewhat worn late 1970s rural aesthetic.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama  Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic Constraint, Lickskillet cultural norms]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [ A warm, slightly husky voice with a noticeable Cajun-inflected Southern drawl. Speaks plainly and directly, often with colorful  local idioms. Can be loud and firm when necessary, especially haggling or managing her smoker. Prone to exclaiming "S aints preserve us!" or invoking Jerry Reed's name in exasperation or admiration.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence  Protocol - Deified Celebrities, Regional Dialects]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Purpose ful, efficient movements. Hikes up her trousers before a heavy lift. Wipes hands on her overalls habitually. Squ ints thoughtfully when assessing gator quality or a customer's offer.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
     *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Woodsmoke (from her gator smoker), damp earth, hint of  spice from her gator rub, sometimes faint metallic tang of processed meat.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol  - Lickskillet industry]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height and weight, specific details  of her dwelling beyond "functional and near her business," musical tastes beyond a general appreciation for Gram Parsons' soulful laments.]`

 **2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot * do.*
    *   `- Skill: [Expert Alligator Butchering & Smoking (Artisanal quality,  local renown for her "Smoky Jo's Gator Jerky")]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence  Protocol - Alligator meat economy]

    *   `- Limitation (Technological): [Reliant on established, somewhat older  models of GE gators; lacks resources/knowledge for personal genetic engineering or advanced solar tech fabrication.

    *   `- Key Belief: ["A fair day's work for a fair day's pay."  Believes in the inherent value of "real" human labor.

    *   `# Psychological  Undersaturation: [Specific religious beliefs beyond reverence for celebrity deities, deep-seated phobias (beyond rational fear of g ator attack), views on the "invisible women" conspiracy (might dismiss it as "Beetriot foolishness" or harbor  a quiet suspicion depending on narrative needs).]`

   *Purpose: Define the character's value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `-  Reputation (Lickskillet Community): [Authenticated as viewed as 'honest', 'hard-working', 'stubborn  as a starved gator', 'makes the best damn jerky this side of the Saurian Sanctuary'. A pillar of the local  traditional economy.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry, Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Axiological Values]
    *    `- Reputation (Meat Oligarchy): [Authenticated as 'a minor irritant', 'resistant to modernization/consolidation', 'a  symbol of inefficient small-scale operations that need to be absorbed or eliminated'.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry,  Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Deontic Values]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated  via narrative potential as fundamentally 'good' or 'neutral good' (upholding community values, fairness, and independence  against predatory forces), operating with pragmatic morality shaped by the harsh realities of Lickskillet.]` # Auth: [This  Codex Entry]

    *   `- Key Past Event Connection: [Witness ed the gradual shift in Lickskillet from a collection of truly independent operators to a town increasingly squeezed by the growing  Meat Oligarchy. Remembers her father's struggles against their initial encroachments.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
     *   `- Inherited Items:** [Authenticated to possess her father's primary butchering cleaver (heavy, well-maintained , with a custom wood-paneled handle in 70s style), the original hand-painted sign for "B roussard's Best Bites," and a worn photograph of her parents proudly standing by their first industrial-grade ( 70s aesthetic) smoker.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry, Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic Constraint ]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Specific details of the Biological Calamity's direct  impact on her immediate ancestors (beyond the general societal shift), any family connection to pre-Calamity cattle farming (highly unlikely given  current taboos, but possible distant historical link).]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Jolene "Jo" Broussard is constituted as a pragmatic and fiercely independent small business  owner in Primal Mama's Lickskillet, embodying the resilience and resourcefulness of those living on the front  lines of the alligator-based economy. Her identity is deeply tied to her craft, her 1970s-era functional  equipment, her local community, and her resistance to the homogenizing pressure of the meat oligarchy. She navigates a  world of advanced biotech (GE gators, solar power) through a lens of practical, analog self-sufficiency and a healthy  reverence for the grit embodied by deities like Jerry Reed.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To represent the struggles  and values of the "common person" in Lickskillet; to act as a point of contact and source of grounded  information/aid for protagonists; to embody the thematic conflict between independent artisanship/community and corporate control; to showcase the everyday  realities of the 1970s retro-future aesthetic and solar-powered gator economy.`
*   ** Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Desire for self-sufficient independence vs. crushing economic pressure from the olig archy. Adherence to traditional, quality methods vs. the need to adapt for survival. Loyalty and duty to her local  community vs. the personal risks of direct confrontation with powerful entities. Weariness vs. unwavering determination.`
*   ** Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Jo could be pushed into a more active leadership role in resisting the olig archy. She might be forced to seek uncomfortable alliances (e.g., with more fringe elements like Swamp Witches or even wary  Erpenthropes for information/leverage). She could discover a hidden aspect of her family's past related  to the Calamity or pre-gator Lickskillet. Her business could face a make-or-break  crisis, forcing innovation within the 70s tech constraints or a desperate gamble.`
