# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III .B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Text ually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal  Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them ** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition **.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating  multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions  are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*( Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical  Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `-  Appearance_General: [Human Form: Appears as an elderly woman of indeterminate advanced age (consistent with Erpenth rope near-immortality), with rich, dark skin deeply lined like ancient riverbeds. Possesses a strong,  upright posture that belies her apparent age. Alligator Beast Man Form: A formidable, dark-scaled bipedal alligator , larger than most GE gators, retaining a spark of profound intelligence in her reptilian eyes.]` # Auth: [ Primal Mama Codex: Erpenthrope Transformation; This Entry]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [ Human Form: Striking, intelligent eyes, the color of dark amber, often holding a knowing, slightly amused glint. Her  hair is a thick mane of silver-grey locs, often adorned with small, polished alligator scutes, iridescent beetle  carapaces, or carved pieces of petrified wood. High cheekbones and a broad, expressive mouth.]` # Auth : [This Entry]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [Human Form: A series of faded  ritual scars in geometric patterns on her forearms and collarbone, hinting at ancient practices. Alligator Form: Unique, almost  hieroglyphic-like scale patterns along her spine.]` # Auth: [This Entry]
    *   `- Typical Att ire: [Human Form: Practical, durable clothing made from woven plant fibers, treated hides (non-cattle, likely  gator or other swamp creatures), and repurposed textiles, often in earthy tones of deep greens, browns, and ochres . Items sometimes feature subtle 1970s-esque geometric patterns or color accents (e.g., a faded orange trim  on a tunic), suggesting a long observation and adaptation of human aesthetics rather than adherence to fashion. Wears sturdy, waterproof  swamp boots. Often carries a woven satchel.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex: 197 0s Tech Aesthetic; This Entry]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Human Form: Deep,  resonant, and calm, with a slight, unplaceable accent that feels older than current regional dialects. Speaks thoughtfully,  often in parables or nature-based metaphors. Capable of a powerful, commanding tone when necessary. Her Alligator Form communicates  through powerful hisses, growls, and surprisingly nuanced body language, understood by other Erpenthropes and some attuned  individuals.]` # Auth: [This Entry]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Human Form : Deliberate, graceful movements; a keen, constant observer of her surroundings. Has a habit of lightly touching plants  or natural objects as she passes. Alligator Form: A powerful, surprisingly agile stride.]` # Auth: [This Entry] 
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Human Form: Faint scent of damp earth, river  mud, sweetgrass, and a hint of medicinal herbs or exotic swamp incense.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex:  Bayou-infused miasma; This Entry]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/weight in  human form; specific details of her Alligator Beast Man form beyond 'formidable' and 'dark-scaled'; precise nature  of all adornments.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**

    *    `- Skill: [Herbalism & Ritualistic Practices (Advanced): Knowledge of medicinal and psychoactive swamp plants, ability to  perform rituals for communion with nature spirits or possibly ghost interaction (distinct from, but perhaps overlapping with, Swamp Witch methods).] ` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex: Spectral Interaction, Swamp Witch Lore (as comparative context); This Entry]
     *   `- Skill: [Oral Storytelling & Lore Keeping (Master): Custodian of ancient Erpenthrope  history and pre-calamity knowledge fragments.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex: Erpenthrope Knowledge  (Truth Seekers); This Entry]
    *   `- Ability (Unique): [Near-Immortality (Er penthrope Trait): Ageless, highly resistant to conventional harm, exceptionally long-lived.]` # Auth: [Pr imal Mama Codex: Erpenthropic Transformation]
    *   `- Ability (Unique): [Profound Empath ic Connection to Alligators & Swamp Ecology: Can sense the 'health' of the swamp and the emotional state of all igators to a degree far beyond normal perception.]` # Auth: [This Entry, derived from Erpenthrope nature] 
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Human form, while resilient, is still that of an elder; direct physical confrontation  in this form is avoided. Transformation requires significant energy and is not undertaken lightly.]` # Auth: [This Entry]
     *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [While possessing vast historical knowledge, she may lack specifics on newest GE alligator strains or intricate Beet riot politics if she remains isolated. Her understanding of the 1970s aesthetic is observational, not technical.] ` # Auth: [This Entry]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Deeply distrustful of outsiders, especially  those from Beetriot or representing the meat oligarchy. Unlikely to engage with Automaton/LLM users due to a  preference for organic intelligence/wisdom and potential aversion to their "stain."]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex : Automaton/LLM User Stigma; This Entry]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Specific  combat capabilities in Alligator form beyond 'formidable'; exact limits of her ritual magic; proficiency with any 1970 s-aesthetic technology.]`

     *   `- Key Belief: [The biological calamity was a consequence of imbalance, and true survival/wisdom lies in respecting  the natural (albeit mutated) order. Believes the current human power structures (Beetriot, oligarchy) are repeating  old mistakes. Sees the deified celebrities as a peculiar, fleeting human coping mechanism.]` # Auth: [This Entry]
     *   `- Internal Conflict: [The Erpenthrope drive to seek/preserve Truth vs. the immense danger of revealing it  in a world built on convenient lies and propaganda (e.g., the cattle taboo's true origins, the calamity 's nature). Her protective instincts vs. the occasional need to intervene or guide.]` # Auth: [This Entry]
     *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Possesses authenticated, vivid memories stretching back centuries, including clear recollections of the pre- calamity world, the event itself, and the subsequent societal shifts.

    *   `- Primary Affiliation: [Erpenthropes  (as a distinct, perhaps reclusive, group).]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex: Erpenthropes] 
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: [Informal, cautious alliances with specific, trusted individuals in Lickskillet or  independent swamp communities who respect the old ways. Possible wary respect/distance with certain Swamp Witches, recognizing different paths to similar power/ knowledge.]` # Auth: [This Entry]

Her existence is debated , but stories of her interventions or sightings persist.]` # Auth: [This Entry]
    *   `- Reputation (Er penthropes): [Authenticated as highly revered, a living ancestor, a primary source of their "Truths" and traditions .]` # Auth: [This Entry]
    *   `- Reputation (Meat Oligarchy/Beetriot Elite ): [If known at all, likely categorized as a dangerous poacher, a subversive element, or a primitive superstition. Any  Erpenthrope might be seen as a threat to the GE alligator industry if their abilities are misunderstood as competition or a  source of 'wild' genetic material.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex: Meat Oligarchy Friction; This Entry] 
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via narrative potential as a guardian of ancient wisdom and  natural balance. Her actions, while potentially conflicting with human laws (e.g., "poaching" if she protects  wild gators from unsustainable harvest, or her views on cattle), are rooted in a deeper, ecological morality. She values truth over  societal comfort.]` # Auth: [This Entry]

The  unfolding of the Biological Calamity (perhaps not its ultimate cause, but its immediate effects and the human reactions). 3.  The true reasons behind the cattle consumption taboo (biochemical incompatibility combined with elite manipulation/propaganda). 4. The early  development and societal adoption of GE alligators and solar power. 5. The historical context for the 1970 s aesthetic becoming dominant.]` # Auth: [This Entry, derived from near-immortality and Truth Seeker role ]
    *   `- Inherited Items/Knowledge:** [Authenticated to possess ancient Erpenthrope lore, rituals , and potentially physical artifacts (e.g., stone tablets, carved bones) that predate the calamity, passed down through generations  or collected over her long life. This knowledge includes "truths" about the world that contradict official narratives.]` # Auth: [This  Entry]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Specific details of her life in the pre-cal amity world; her personal role during the calamity itself; the exact origins of Erpenthropes (which she may or may  not fully know).]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity,  internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Mawu  "Mama" Gator is constituted as a living embodiment of Primal Mama's ancient, spiritual, and ecological soul,  a bridge between the world-before-calamity and the retro-futuristic present. Her Erpenthrope nature  grants her near-immortality and a deep connection to the Truth, placing her in direct opposition to the superficialities  and propaganda of mainstream society (e.g., celebrity worship, cattle taboo as purely cultural). Her African-coded features and  matriarchal bearing further root her in a primal, foundational wisdom. She is the swamp's memory and its fierce  protector, a figure of immense power and profound weariness, operating according to natural laws that supersede human constructs.`
*    **Primary Narrative Function:** `Serves as a potential mentor, a source of forbidden knowledge/truth, a moral compass aligned  with the natural world, and a guardian of ancient secrets. Can act as a catalyst for other characters' quests for understanding, or  an antagonist to those who would exploit the swamp or perpetuate harmful falsehoods. Represents a challenge to the established order of Primal Mama,  not through overt rebellion, but through the sheer weight of her existence and knowledge.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From  Bundle):** `The burden of truth vs. the danger of its revelation; the desire to guide vs. the instinct  for self-preservation and secrecy; her ancient connection to the natural cycle vs. the increasingly artificial and controlled world built  by humans; weariness from centuries of observation vs. the enduring spark of hope/duty to protect.`
*    **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Deciding to share more of her knowledge, potentially triggering significant societal  upheaval. Being forced to directly confront threats to the swamp or other Erpenthropes. Guiding a protagonist towards  a crucial understanding of the world's true nature. Her reaction to individuals who manage to earn her trust despite her ingrained  caution (e.g., an LLM user who genuinely seeks truth despite the stigma). The rediscovery or revelation of further  aspects of Erpenthrope origins or abilities.`
