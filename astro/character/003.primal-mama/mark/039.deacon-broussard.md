## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama  heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them ** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition **.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating  multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle .*

*   **Core Essence:** `Deacon "Bones" Broussard is constituted as the embodiment of L ickskillet's dying independent spirit, a skilled artisan crushed by the inexorable advance of the Meat Oligarchy. His African  features place him visibly within the diverse tapestry of Primal Mama's swamp communities. His identity is defined by what he has  *lost* – his business, his status, his livelihood – and the resilient, if bitter, spirit that endures. He  is a living testament to the "friction" mentioned in the Primal Mama Coherence Protocol, a direct casualty of the deont ic power wielded by the elite. His adherence to the 1970s aesthetic is not a choice but the  ingrained reality of his environment and former trade.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a potent symbol of the socio -economic oppression within Primal Mama; to provide a voice for the disenfranchised of Lickskillet; to act  as a potential source of crucial information or reluctant assistance to protagonists opposing the Oligarchy; to ground the more fantastical elements of Pr imal Mama in harsh, human-level reality.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Pride  in his heritage/craft vs. the shame of his current poverty; The desire for justice/retribution vs. the overwhelming power  of the Oligarchy and the instinct for self-preservation; Nostalgia for a romanticized past vs. the bitter  reality of the present.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be galvanized into action by a  new threat or opportunity; might find a way to pass on his lost skills/knowledge; could become a reluctant leader or  figurehead for a struggling community; or could succumb entirely to despair. His interaction with characters who possess more agency (e.g ., Erpenthropes, determined investigators) could be transformative.`
