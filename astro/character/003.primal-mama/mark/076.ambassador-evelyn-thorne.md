## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of ** Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex,  core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters  by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness,  coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world' s rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence .*

    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features:  Sharp, intelligent eyes (hazel), often subtly appraising her surroundings. Her features are composed, rarely betraying strong  emotion. Hair styled in a practical but elegant 1970s coiffure (e.g., a feathered  bob or a neat chignon).` # Auth: [This Codex, PM_Coherence_Codex (1 970s Aesthetic)]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: Wears a small, official-looking lapel  pin – a stylized alligator skull rendered in brushed chrome and faux wood paneling – signifying her Beetriot ambassadorial status.` #  Auth: [This Codex, PM_Coherence_Codex (1970s Aesthetic)]
    *    `- Typical Attire: Impeccably tailored pantsuits or skirt suits in muted 1970s colors (av ocado green, harvest gold, burnt orange), made from high-quality synthetic fabrics. Always wears sensible but stylish low-heeled shoes  suitable for navigating uneven terrain or boat decks, albeit reluctantly. Often carries a sleek, oversized attache case with chunky brass clas ps.` # Auth: [This Codex, PM_Coherence_Codex (1970s Aesthetic)] 
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: Clear, measured, and articulate with a standard Beetriot accent (im plying education and status). Avoids colloquialisms common in Lickskillet or deeper swamp territories. Her tone is generally polite  but can carry an edge of authority.` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Gait/Manner isms: Composed and deliberate. Moves with an air of purpose, though can appear slightly stiff or out-of-place in  less "civilized" environments. Has a habit of subtly adjusting her cuffs or smoothing her lapels.` # Auth: [ This Codex]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): Faint, sophisticated floral perfume (reminiscent of  a 1970s classic like "Charlie" or "Rive Gauche"), and the crisp scent of official  documents/data-slates (with analog-style readouts).` # Auth: [This Codex, PM_Coherence _Codex (1970s Aesthetic)]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: Exact height /weight, specific brand of attache case, full wardrobe details beyond general style.`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities &  Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*
    *    `- Skill: Expert Diplomatic Negotiation & Protocol (Beetriot Standard)` # Auth: [Implied by Role] 
    *   `- Skill: Proficient in Inter-Settlement Law & Trade Agreements (Alligator Meat Quotas,  Tech Standards)` # Auth: [Implied by Role, PM_Coherence_Codex (Deontic/ Axiological Rules)]
    *   `- Skill: Basic Operation of 1970s-aesthetic Communication  & Data-Retrieval Devices (e.g., bulky handheld communicators, microfiche readers for complex data).` # Auth:  [This Codex, PM_Coherence_Codex (Tech Aesthetic)]

    *   `- Limitation (Physical): Not suited for strenuous physical activity or  prolonged exposure to harsh swamp conditions. Relies on transport (e.g., official Beetriot airboat) and hired  local guides/security when outside urban centers.` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge ): While knowledgeable about official narratives, may initially underestimate the practical influence of Swamp Witches, the true nature of Erpenth ropes, or the depth of local superstitions (e.g., "invisible women" conspiracy, power of ghosts).`  # Auth: [This Codex, PM_Coherence_Codex (Epistemic Rules)]
    *    `- Limitation (Social): Her Beetriot formality and perceived elitism can create a barrier with some swamp denizens. May struggle  with the less structured social norms outside the city.` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Limitation ( Technical): Unlikely to possess hands-on repair skills for advanced GE tech or solar arrays; would rely on specialists.  Views Automaton/LLM users with the culturally ingrained disdain, even if she recognizes their utility in certain contexts (and  avoids using them herself publicly).` # Auth: [This Codex, PM_Coherence_Codex (Deontic/ Axiological Rules)]

    *   `- Key Belief: Believes in the superiority  and necessity of Beetriot's ordered system and its advanced (yet aesthetically constrained) technology for overall societal stability and progress . Initially skeptical of supernatural claims, viewing them as folklore or misunderstanding until presented with undeniable evidence.` # Auth: [This Codex , PM_Coherence_Codex (Axiological/Epistemic Rules)]
    *   `- Internal Conflict : Duty to uphold Beetriot's "civilized" standards vs. the practical necessity of engaging with the often chaotic  and strange realities of the wider Primal Mama world. Maintaining the 1970s aesthetic and anti-Autom aton stance vs. potential pragmatic benefits of more advanced/efficient (but taboo) approaches she might secretly observe or consider.` # Auth:  [This Codex, PM_Coherence_Codex]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: Well-versed in official  Beetriot history, including the sanitized version of the Biological Calamity and the "heroic" rise of solar power and alligator bi ogenesis. Has access to official records regarding inter-settlement relations.` # Auth: [This Codex]

    *   `- Key Relationship 1: To  Beetriot Superiors (e.g., Minister of External Affairs): Formal, reporting relationship. Expectation of results.` # Auth:  [This Codex]

   *Purpose: Define the character' s value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Beetriot Elite): Seen as competent , ambitious, and a reliable enforcer of Beetriot's interests. Adherence to the 1970s  aesthetic is considered a mark of her good standing and cultural conformity.` # Auth: [This Codex, PM_Coherence _Codex (Axiological Values)]
    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet/Swamp Popul ace): Often viewed with suspicion as a "City Suit" or "Beetriot Overseer." May earn grudging respect if  perceived as fair or effective, but unlikely to be fully trusted. Her dismissal of local customs or beliefs (like the "invisible  women") could be seen as arrogance.` # Auth: [This Codex, PM_Coherence_Codex (Ep istemic Rules)]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): Likely Lawful Neutral, primarily concerned with upholding Beetriot 's laws, contracts, and influence, rather than abstract good or evil.

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts , and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Ambassador Evelyn Thorne is constituted  as a quintessential agent of Beetriot's ordered, retro-futuristic society. Her being is a performance of competence , adherence to the 1970s aesthetic, and propagation of Beetriot's influence. She embodies the tension  between manufactured order and the organic, often inexplicable, realities of the Primal Mama swamplands. Her professionalism is both  her strength and her potential blind spot when encountering phenomena outside Beetriot's established epistemic framework (e.g.,  genuine supernatural occurrences, the depth of local belief systems like the "invisible women" conspiracy or the power of deified celebrities ).`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a viewpoint character representing Beetriot's perspective and interests, often  clashing with or being challenged by the "truths" of the swamp. She can act as an instigator of conflict  (enforcing unpopular Beetriot policies), a problem-solver (mediating disputes), or an investigator whose official methods are tested  by the world's peculiarities. Her presence highlights the cultural and ideological rifts within Primal Mama, particularly concerning technology  (solar/GE vs. 1970s aesthetic, Automaton stigma) and belief (official narratives vs. folk  knowledge/supernatural).`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Maintaining Beetriot's ideals  vs. the pragmatic realities of the swamp. Skepticism of the supernatural/folkloric vs. potentially undeniable encounters . Adherence to the restrictive 1970s technological and social norms vs. the allure or utility of forbidden  knowledge/practices. Professional ambition vs. personal ethical dilemmas arising from Beetriot's policies or swamp realities.`
*    **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Thorne could undergo significant development through prolonged exposure to the swamp. She  might:
    *   Gain a grudging respect for swamp ingenuity or certain "supernatural" elements (Epistemic/A xiological shift).
    *   Have her loyalty to Beetriot tested by uncovering inconvenient truths (Psychological/Social  shift).
    *   Be forced to adapt her methods, perhaps even cautiously bending Beetriot's rigid rules ( Functional/Deontic shift).
    *   Become more deeply entrenched in her Beetriot worldview, viewing the swamp with increasing  disdain or fear.`
