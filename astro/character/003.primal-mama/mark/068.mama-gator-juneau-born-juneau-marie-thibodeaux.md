## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of  **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole žel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative  source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

* Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity  arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties  constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory  Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General : [Sturdy, weathered human female, appears late 50s but moves with the vigor of someone younger. Sun -leathery skin from decades in the swamp.]` # Auth: [PM_Codex_0.1 -  Implied Lickskillet lifestyle]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Sharp, assessing hazel eyes; a  network of fine lines around them. Strong, calloused hands. Jaw often set with determination. Hair, once dark brown , now mostly silver, usually tied back in a practical bun or braid.]` # Auth: [Implied by archetype  and environment]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [Faded, thin scar running along her left  forearm from a juvenile gator mishap decades ago. A single alligator tooth, polished smooth, worn on a leather thong around her neck .]` # Auth: [Plausible for her profession]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Practical , durable clothing adhering to a subtle 1970s rural aesthetic: faded denim overalls over a plaid work shirt, or  sturdy canvas pants and a simple knit top. Always wears knee-high, waterproof swamp boots. Often a wide-brim med, woven river-grass hat, patched with what looks like duct tape with a wood-grain pattern.]` # Auth: [ PM_Codex_0.1 - Technological Aesthetic Constraint; Lickskillet environment]
    *   `- Voice /Speech Pattern: [Warm but firm contralto with a pronounced Lickskillet bayou drawl. Speaks plainly  and directly, often using colorful, swamp-derived metaphors. Can be surprisingly soft-spoken until angered.]` # Auth : [Implied regional dialect]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Economical, sure-footed movements,  even on unstable ground. Habit of scanning the waterline. Wipes hands on her overalls. When thinking, she might tap  the gator tooth necklace.]` # Auth: [Implied by profession and environment]
    *   `- Associated  Scent (If Any): [Faint, earthy smell of swamp water, alligator musk, and smoked meat, with  an occasional hint of solar panel cleaning fluid or 1970s-style degreaser.]` # Auth: [ PM_Codex_0.1 - Alligator meat processing, Solar dominance]
    *   `# Physical  Undersaturation: [Exact height/weight, specific brand of her preferred (likely locally made or heavily modified) boots,  childhood illnesses.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character  *can* and *cannot* do.*
    *   `- Skill: [Expert Alligator Husbandry (GE  Solar Gators): Deep, practical knowledge of their diet (beyond solar), breeding cycles, health, solar charging requirements, and humane  harvesting/processing techniques.]` # Auth: [PM_Codex_0.1 - Alligator Biogenesis, All igator Meat]
    *   `- Skill: [Proficient Mechanic (1970s Analog Tech): Ade pt at repairing and maintaining her farm’s solar power arrays, watercraft engines (likely airboats or shallow-draft skiffs ), and butchering equipment, all within the 1970s aesthetic using chunky, repairable components.]`  # Auth: [PM_Codex_0.1 - Solar Dominance, Technological Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Skill : [Proficient Marksmanship (Hunting Rifle & Shotgun): Owns and maintains firearms for protection and occasional (non -alligator) swamp game hunting, reflecting local gun culture.]` # Auth: [PM_Codex_0.1 -  Gun Ownership (Regional)]

    *   `- Limitation  (Knowledge): [Limited understanding of the advanced genetic engineering principles behind the gators beyond "what works."

    *   `- Limitation (Social /Political): [Little influence outside Lickskillet; distrustful of Beetriot bureaucracy and has no desire to engage with it . Avoids Automaton/LLM use, relying on her own ledgers and community word-of-mouth,  which may put her at a disadvantage against more 'modernized' (within 70s tech) oligarch operations.]` # Auth : [PM_Codex_0.1 - Automaton/LLM User Stigma, Axiological: Autonomy vs Automation ]

    *   `- Internal Conflict: [Desire to preserve her traditional methods vs. the economic necessity  to adapt (within 70s tech limits) to compete. Pride in her independence vs. the loneliness and vulnerability  of her position.]` # Auth: [Plausible character tension]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [ Vivid memories of Lickskillet before the oligarchy became so dominant. Knowledge passed down from her parents about living  in the swamp post-Calamity. No direct memory of pre-Calamity, but holds onto stories.] ` # Auth: [Plausible for her age and location]
    *   `# Psychological Undersaturation:  [Specific views on the deified celebrities (likely sees them as distant figures, less relevant to daily survival than local spirits/ lore, if any), detailed opinions on Erpenthropes (might view them with wary respect or simple pragmatism if  encountered), depth of belief in "invisible women" conspiracy (could be a low-level grumble or a more active  suspicion).]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity,  internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Mama Gator June au is constituted as the resilient heart of Lickskillet's fading independence. Her identity is forged from a lifetime in  the Primal Mama swamplands, mastering GE alligator husbandry and 1970s analog technology through sheer necessity and grit . She embodies the Axiological tension between cherished Autonomy and the encroaching, impersonal power of the Meat Oligarchy.  Her Functional skills are intrinsically tied to her Physical environment and the world's specific Technological Aesthetic. Her Psychological makeup (stubborn,  pragmatic, fiercely independent) is a direct result of her Social position as a small operator fighting for survival.`
*   ** Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a key representative of the "mom-and-pop" sector struggling against the olig archy, providing a grounded, local perspective on the Primal Mama world. She can act as a mentor, a source of crucial  local knowledge, a symbol of resistance, or a tragic figure illustrating the costs of the oligarchy's dominance. She  grounds the more bizarre elements of the world in everyday struggle.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):**  `Tradition vs. Pragmatic Adaptation (within 70s tech). Independence vs. Vulnerability. Community Obl igation vs. Self-Preservation. Suspicion of "New" (even 70s-style advanced) vs. Need  to Utilize Tools for Survival.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Juneau could be pushed  to: organize a local resistance/cooperative (Social/Relational change); be forced to make a deal with an  unlikely ally (e.g., a specific Erpenthrope, a more ethical Beetriot contact, or even a  rival small operator); reluctantly adopt a new piece of 1970s-style tech that gives her an edge ( Functional change); or face the loss of her farm, forcing a major Psychological and Social shift.`
