## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed  definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole žel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **rich ness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the  world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [e.g., High cheekbones, a broad, kind nose , and full lips often set in a thoughtful expression or a warm smile.

    *   `- Typical Attire: [e .g., Practical, durable clothing suited to the swamp environment and Lickskillet's functional aesthetic. Often wears sturdy , wide-legged trousers made from tough, woven plant fibers dyed in ochre or forest green, a simple, long-sleeved  tunic, and a vest with many pockets, all reflecting the 1970s utilitarian design language. Items are well -maintained but clearly well-used.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama World Codex v0.1 -  Tech Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [e.g., A warm, contralto voice that  can be soothing or firm as needed. Speaks with a clear, deliberate cadence, often using vivid metaphors drawn from swamp ecology  and local folklore. Her laughter is full and infectious.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *    `- Gait/Mannerisms: [e.g., Moves with a purposeful, unhurried grace. Has a habit  of tapping her chin when thinking, and her hands are expressive when she speaks, often gesturing to emphasize a point with tools  or components if she's working.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]

    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [Her  views on the deified celebrities (likely pragmatic, perhaps seeing their stories as useful parables rather than literal divinity); her  specific stance on the "Invisible Women" conspiracy (might see it as misdirection from real oppressors like the oligarchy).]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Mama Zola is constituted as the resilient, wise heart of Lickskillet, a pragmatic  champion for the common folk of Primal Mama's bayous. Her identity is forged from a deep connection to her community , mastery over the world's ubiquitous 1970s technology (especially solar), and an unwavering commitment to justice  against the encroachments of the meat oligarchy. She embodies the virtues of practical ingenuity, communal strength, and the preservation  of local autonomy, standing in stark contrast to the impersonal power of Beetriot and the mystifying abilities of Erpenthropes  or high-level Swamp Witches. Her understanding of the delicate balance of the swamp, including its more spectral elements, is  practical rather than mystical.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a moral compass and a catalyst for resistance  in Lickskillet. She can be a key ally for protagonists, a source of crucial local knowledge and technological aid , and a voice for the oppressed. She embodies the theme of human resilience and ingenuity in the face of overwhelming systemic and  environmental challenges, and represents the struggle against corporate feudalism within Primal Mama's unique setting.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts  (From Bundle):** `The weight of her community's reliance on her vs. her own aging and limited resources.  The ethical dilemmas of how far to push resistance against a powerful foe (Oligarchy). Balancing the preservation of tradition and  local knowledge with the need for practical innovation to survive. Trusting outsiders vs. protecting her community's insular ways .`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be forced to make increasingly difficult choices regarding  the level of confrontation with the Oligarchy. Might reluctantly engage more deeply with the supernatural aspects of the swamp (e.g., seeking  aid from more powerful Witches or even Erpenthropes if desperate). Could mentor a new generation of leaders/ innovators. Her understanding of the "Invisible Women" conspiracy could evolve, perhaps uncovering a local angle or debunking it to  focus people on tangible threats.`
