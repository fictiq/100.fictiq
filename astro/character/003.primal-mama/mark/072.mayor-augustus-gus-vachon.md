## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons ** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters ** ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives).  They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating  their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential  tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember  **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Broad , expressive face, often a practiced, reassuring smile that doesn't reach his cold, calculating eyes. Perfectly coiffed,  dark hair (rumored to be dyed) in a style popular in the late 1970s. Prom inent jaw.]` # Auth: [Narrative Description]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [W ears a large, ostentatious gold ring shaped like a stylized alligator head devouring a miniature, jeweled longhorn steer  – a personal symbol of his power over both key economic/cultural symbols.]` # Auth: [Visual Concept, Narrative Description]
     *   `- Typical Attire: [Impeccable 1970s-style business suits ( polyester blends, earth tones, sometimes pinstripes or subtle patterns), wide patterned ties. Always appears 'on display '. Off-duty, favors high-end leisure suits and open-necked shirts, still within the 70s aesthetic.] ` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Codex (Tech Aesthetic), Visual Guide]
    *   `- Voice/Speech  Pattern: [Deep, resonant baritone with a carefully cultivated folksy but authoritative Southern drawl. Masterful orator, capable of rousing  speeches and quiet intimidation. Speech is peppered with folksy aphorisms and references to the Deified Celebrities.] ` # Auth: [Dialogue Direction, Primal Mama Coherence Codex (Deified Celebrities)]
    *    `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Confident, almost swaggering gait. Uses broad, expansive hand gestures when speaking publicly . Has a habit of clasping his hands behind his back when observing or contemplating. Can switch from avuncular charm  to icy menace in an instant.]` # Auth: [Action Description]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If  Any): [Expensive, slightly overpowering 1970s-era men's cologne (e.g.,  a spicy musk), fine tobacco (from rare, pre-calamity styled cigars smoked in private).]` # Auth : [Sensory Palette]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/weight, specific details of private  living space beyond adherence to 70s aesthetic, casual clothing preferences.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated  Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*

Dismissive of knowledge that doesn't fit his worldview or serve  his power.]` # Auth: [Dialogue revealing biases, Primal Mama Coherence Codex (Epistemic)]
    *    `- Limitation (Social/Technological): [Genuine disdain for and suspicion of Automatons/LLMs, publicly championing " honest human labor" in line with the cultural stigma, though he may secretly use heavily disguised, specialized analog computing or data  analysis for his own ends, framed within the 70s aesthetic.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Co herence Codex (Deontic - Automaton Stigma, Tech Aesthetic)]

    *   `- Key Belief: [The masses are fickle and require a strong, unwavering hand.

Any deviation is a step towards another Calamity.]` # Auth: [Speeches, Policy Decisions, Primal Mama Co herence Codex (Axiological/Tech Aesthetic)]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [Desire for adulation vs . inherent distrust of everyone.

        *   *Description:* `[He is subject to the  world's laws (e.g., he cannot eat cattle flesh without consequence), but he is the primary enforcer and  interpreter of many of them, especially the Deontic (legal) and Axiological (value) ones.]`

    *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin:  [Authenticated to have risen to power in Beetriot in the decades following the Biological Calamity, likely through shrewd political maneuvering and ruth lessly exploiting the chaos and subsequent restructuring of society around alligator meat and the cattle taboo.]` # Auth: [Implied by  age and Primal Mama Coherence Codex (History)]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from  the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Mayor Augustus "Gus" Vachon is constituted  as the embodiment of Primal Mama's retro-futuristic tyranny, a charismatic but ruthless autocrat ruling Beetriot.  He is defined by his obsession with control, which he maintains by masterfully manipulating the world's unique Deontic (cattle  laws, Automaton stigma), Axiological (1970s aesthetic, celebrity worship), and Epistemic (propaganda,  "invisible women" conspiracy) modalities. His power is built upon the foundation of GE solar gators and the suppression of any  deviation from his 1970s-enforced "Primal Order." He is a product of the post-calam ity world who has shaped its dominant power structures to his benefit.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `Primary Ant agonist. Represents the oppressive societal forces, corruption, and abuse of power within Primal Mama. He is the gatekeeper of Beet riot's resources and the enforcer of its rigid, anachronistic cultural norms. His actions drive conflict for protagonists  seeking freedom, truth (Erpenthropes), or equitable survival (Lickskillet residents).`
*   **Key  Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Maintaining a facade of benevolent 1970s cool vs. his deep-seated paranoia  and ruthless methods. The desire for total control vs. the inherent wildness of the swamp, Erpenthropes , and magic. Public reverence for "human ingenuity" vs. potential secret reliance on forbidden or advanced (but disguised) information  systems.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `His grip on power could be challenged by  uncovering truths about the Calamity or his own past (Historical/Epistemic shift). His reliance on the 1 970s aesthetic could become a vulnerability if new, uncontrollable tech emerges. Alliances might shift if the meat oligarchy  sees him as a liability. His paranoia could escalate, leading to more erratic and self-destructive actions (Psychological change ).`
