## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Text ually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Remi "Swamp-Whis per" Dubois is constituted as a man deeply rooted in the Primal Mama swamp, embodying the resilience and traditional skills of  Lickskillet's independent alligator processors. His identity is defined by his Functional capabilities (swamp expertise, old -tech maintenance) and his Psychological makeup (pride, familial devotion, wary resilience). He is a direct victim of the world 's authenticated Deontic reality (the "friction" from the Meat Processor Oligarchy) and its Axiological disparities  (Lickskillet's values vs. Beetriot's power). His struggle highlights the tension between local autonomy  and corporate dominance within the unique retro-futuristic, bayou-infused setting.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:**  `To embody the human cost of the Meat Oligarchy's power; to serve as a relatable viewpoint into the struggles of L ickskillet's populace; to act as a potential catalyst for resistance or a tragic figure illustrating the consequences of unchecked  corporate greed within Primal Mama. He provides a grounded, human perspective on the world's more bizarre elements.`
*   ** Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Maintaining independence vs. Succumbing to economic necessity; Trusting in community vs . The overwhelming power of the oligarchy; Holding onto hope for his children's future vs. The encroaching despair  of his present circumstances; Adherence to traditional, sustainable practices vs. The BGC's exploitative efficiency.`
*    **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be pushed to seek desperate alliances (e.g., with marginalized  figures like Swamp Witches, or even an unlikely Erpenthrope); could become a reluctant leader of local resistance;  could be tragically broken, serving as a warning; or could find an unexpected way to leverage his unique skills against the B GC. His relationship with the encroaching 1970s-style advanced technology of the BGC versus his own aging  gear is a key tension point.`
