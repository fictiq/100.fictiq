# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica  III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama  heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them ** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition **.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating  multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Authent icated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.) *

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence .*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Human female, early 40s, impeccably groomed with  a sharp, intelligent face. Maintains a professional, somewhat rigid posture.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *    `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Cool blue eyes that observe everything with polite scrutiny; carefully styled dark hair, often in a practical  but elegant updo compliant with 1970s fashion (e.g., a smooth chignon or a feathered  Farrah Fawcett-esque cut if more 'relaxed'). Lips often curved in a practiced, neutral smile.]` # Auth: [This  Codex]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [None visible; projects an image of unblemished Beet riot sophistication.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Tailored pants uits in muted earth tones or bold 1970s colors like ochre or avocado green, sharp-coll ared blouses, platform-heeled boots or shoes. All items, while high-quality, strictly adhere to the late 19 70s aesthetic. May wear subtle jewelry, like a chunky gold-toned necklace or geometric earrings, again, era -specific.]` # Auth: [This Codex / Primal Mama - Tech Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Voice /Speech Pattern: [Clear, measured alto voice with a precise Beetriot accent. Articulate and uses formal language,  even in casual settings. Rarely uses slang, unless strategically to build rapport, often with mild awkwardness.]` # Auth: [ This Codex]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Deliberate, confident gait. Subtle hand  gestures to emphasize points. Habit of lightly tapping a pen (1970s design, of course) against her dat apad when considering a difficult point. Can project an air of slight impatience when dealing with perceived inefficiency.]` # Auth: [This Codex ]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Faint, expensive-smelling synthetic floral perfume  (a 1970s classic like 'Charlie' or a bespoke equivalent), overlaying the scent of recycled  air from Beetriot environments.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation:  [Exact height/weight, preferred casual wear (if she ever truly relaxes), private anxieties manifested physically beyond subtle impatience.]`

** 2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and  *cannot* do.*
    *   `- Skill: [Expert Negotiation & Diplomacy (Core Skill)]` # Auth: [Her  Role/Background]
    *   `- Skill: [Proficient Public Speaking & Persuasion (within Beetriot norms )]` # Auth: [Her Role]
    *   `- Skill: [Advanced Cultural Analysis (Specializing in Beet riot-Swampland socio-economics)]` # Auth: [Her Role]
    *   `- Skill: [ Operation of Beetriot-standard 1970s-aesthetic communication & data-retrieval technology (e.g ., chunky datapad with analog-style readouts, secure comm-links with rotary-style interfaces for channel selection).]` #  Auth: [This Codex / Primal Mama - Tech Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Ability (Situational): [Access  to Beetriot governmental resources & information channels (within limits of her clearance and the 1970s tech constraints ).]` # Auth: [Her Role]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Limited practical understanding of deep  swamp survival, alligator husbandry, or the nuances of Erpenthrope/Swamp Witch culture beyond official Beetriot briefings  (which may be biased or incomplete).]` # Auth: [Primal Mama - Epistemic Modalities / Her Background ]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Often perceived as an outsider in non-Beetriot communities; struggles  with the "stain on reputation" if forced to visibly rely on LLM-derived data or Automaton-assisted  analysis, preferring human aides for such tasks in public.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama - Deontic Mod alities / Her Background]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Standard human physical capabilities; not trained for combat . Over-reliance on Beetriot conveniences means she's ill-suited to extreme physical hardship or prolonged exposure to raw  swamp conditions.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Limitation (Technical): [Bound by the  1970s aesthetic for all her gear; cannot simply use more efficient, differently-styled tech even if available. Repair  of her specialized Beetriot tech in remote areas would be a significant challenge.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama - Tech Aesthetic  Constraint]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Specific languages spoken beyond standard Primal Mama dialect;  proficiency in any personal defense; artistic or hobbyist skills.]`

**3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**

    *   `-  Dominant Emotion (Projected): [Calm Composure / Professional Detachment]` # Auth: [Her Role]
    *    `- Dominant Emotion (Private): [Occasional Frustration (with swamp inefficiencies or perceived irrationality); Underlying Stress  (of maintaining Beetriot standards in alien environments)]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Key  Motivator: [Successfully executing Beetriot's diplomatic agenda; personal career advancement within the Beetriot hierarchy; maintaining order and  (Beetriot's version of) civilized discourse.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Key Belief : [Believes in the efficacy of structured negotiation and rational discourse (Beetriot model) to solve problems. Believes Beet riot's societal model, including its embrace of solar power and regulated GE, is fundamentally superior, even if adaptable.]` # Auth : [This Codex / Primal Mama Axiological/Epistemic notes]
    *   `- Key Belief: [Views  the deified celebrities (Reynolds, Reed, Parsons) with a kind of detached cultural acknowledgment; understands their importance to others  but doesn't personally subscribe to the "divinity," seeing it more as a sociological phenomenon or useful cultural shorthand.]` # Auth : [Primal Mama - Axiological/Epistemic]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [Adherence to Beet riot protocols & aesthetics vs. the practical, often messy, realities of the swamplands; desire for efficient outcomes vs. the social  stigma of Automaton/LLM use; professional duty to represent Beetriot's interests vs. any dawning empathy for the  communities she interacts with.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Clear  recall of Beetriot political theory, diplomatic protocols, and approved historical narratives about the Calamity and the rise of the alligator  economy. Memories of the swamp are more recent, filtered through official reports and her own, sometimes jarring, direct experiences.]` #  Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `# Psychological Undersaturation: [Deep personal fears beyond career failure ; specific childhood influences; her genuine private opinions on the deified celebrities or the "invisible women" conspiracy beyond professional dismissal .]`

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):**

    *   `- Official Role: [Accredited Ambassador of  the Beetriot Municipal Conglomerate.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Social Status: [High  status within Beetriot; viewed as an influential but potentially demanding outsider in communities like Lickskillet. Her status can  open doors or create resentment.]` # Auth: [This Codex / Primal Mama - Deontic/Axiological]
     *   `- Primary Affiliation: [Beetriot Diplomatic Corps (Loyal, career-focused member).]` # Auth : [Her Role]
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: [Transactional relationships with local leaders in assigned territories (e.g ., Mayor of Lickskillet, representatives of mom-and-pop alligator processors, perhaps even cautious feelers towards  meat oligarchy figures if mandated).]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Key Relationship 1: [ To her direct superior in Beetriot (e.g., Minister of External Affairs): Formal, driven by reporting and achieving mandated  objectives.]` # Auth: [Implied by Role]
    *   `- Key Relationship 2: [To  a local counterpart in her assigned region (e.g., Mayor of Lickskillet): Professional, potentially strained by cultural differences and  competing interests. She might view them as parochial, they might view her as arrogant.]` # Auth: [This Codex ]
    *   `- Key Relationship 3: [To her personal aide/assistant (human, to avoid LL M stigma): Reliant on them for logistical support and as a buffer/sounding board, likely a junior Beetriot function ary.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama - Deontic Modalities]
    *   `- Species/ Type: [Human (Beetriot Strain - implies urban upbringing, specific cultural conditioning).]` # Auth: [This Codex] 
    *   `# Social Undersaturation: [Family ties in Beetriot; personal friendships; clandestine contacts if  any; precise level of influence with the meat oligarchies.]`

        *   *Limits:* `N/A`
        *   *Authentication:* `Default  human status within Primal Mama ruleset.`
    *   `# Note: Ambassador Holloway is defined by her socio -political role and conditioning, not by supernatural traits. Her interactions with such elements would be as a mundane human confronting the exceptional .`

   *Purpose: Define the character's value  status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Beetriot Elite): [Valued as a competent , reliable, and discreet diplomatic asset. Seen as upholding Beetriot's image and interests abroad.]` # Auth: [Impl ied by Role & Ambition]
    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet/Swamp Communities): [View ed with a mix of suspicion, curiosity, and potential opportunity. Seen as 'The Woman from Beetriot' – an embodiment  of distant power, wealth, and potentially unwelcome interference or, conversely, a source of aid/trade. Her adherence to the 1 970s aesthetic might be seen as 'fancy' or 'oddly old-fashioned' depending on local interpretation.] ` # Auth: [This Codex / Primal Mama societal divisions]
    *   `- Reputation (Meat Oligarchies ): [Likely seen as a pawn, a potential tool, or a bureaucratic obstacle to be managed or influenced, depending on Beet riot's current policies towards them.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama - Deontic Modalities]
    *    `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated as operating from a position of lawful, ordered pragmatism as defined by Beetriot . Her 'good' is Beetriot's stability and prosperity. Whether this aligns with a broader 'good' is a  source of narrative tension.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation : [Her reputation among Erpenthropes or Swamp Witches (likely non-existent or dismissive, unless her  duties directly intersect with them); public opinion within Beetriot beyond official circles.]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past  Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.*
    *    `- Origin: [Born and educated in Beetriot, post-Calamity generation. Likely from a family with connections  to the city's administrative or technological elite. Selected for the Diplomatic Corps based on aptitude for languages, cultural studies , and adherence to Beetriot ideals within the 1970s aesthetic framework.]` # Auth: [This  Codex]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection: [Successfully negotiated a minor trade agreement between Beetriot and a  remote solar-tech cooperative, showcasing her ability to work within the 1970s tech constraint while achieving results. This  success likely propelled her to more challenging assignments.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Inherited Items/Traits : [Inherited a strong belief in the "Solar Dominance" narrative and the critical importance of alligator-based protein for  societal stability, as per standard Beetriot education. Possesses a set of official Beetriot diplomatic credentials and communication devices,  all in perfect 1970s style.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama - Alethic/ Epistemic Modalities]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Ambassador Vivian Holloway is constituted as a quintessential  product of Beetriot's highly structured, technologically sophisticated (within its 1970s aesthetic) and culturally  dominant society. She is an agent of its order and interests, equipped with sharp intellect and diplomatic skills, but constrained by her  ingrained cultural perspectives and the peculiar limitations of her world (e.g., LLM stigma, aesthetic mandates). Her being  is a testament to Primal Mama's unique blend of retro-futurism and societal adaptation.`
*   **Primary Narrative  Function:** `To serve as a viewpoint into the culture and politics of Beetriot; to act as a catalyst for conflict or  cooperation between Beetriot and other factions (e.g., Lickskillet, mom-and-pop gator  farmers, potentially even the meat oligarchies). She can embody themes of cultural misunderstanding, the limits of diplomacy in a  strange world, and the potential for personal change when confronted with radically different ways of life. She can also highlight the pervasive  influence of the 1970s aesthetic and the peculiar social norms of Primal Mama.`
*   ** Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):**
    *   `Beetriot Idealism vs. Swamp Realism: Her  training and belief in ordered negotiation clash with the often chaotic, superstitious, or brutally pragmatic nature of life outside the city.` 
    *   `Aesthetic Purity vs. Functional Need: The pressure to maintain the 1970s aesthetic in  all her gear and presentation, even when more practical (but stylistically divergent) solutions might be available or sensible.`
    *    `Professional Ambition vs. Ethical Compromise: Navigating the demands of Beetriot's agenda which may require her to overlook  local injustices or align with unsavory elements (like the meat oligarchies).`
    *   `Fear of Stigma vs . Necessity of Information: Her potential need for LLM/Automaton-derived data for complex analyses versus the social " stain" it carries, forcing reliance on human intermediaries or covert use.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle ):**
    *   `Could develop genuine empathy and understanding for non-Beetriot cultures, potentially leading to a crisis of  loyalty (Social/Psychological change).`
    *   `May be forced to adapt her methods, embracing more pragmatic or  even "swamp-wise" approaches to achieve her goals (Functional/Psychological change).`
    *    `Her encounters with the more bizarre elements of Primal Mama (Erpenthropes, ghosts, vampire bunnies) could  challenge her rational Beetriot worldview (Epistemic/Psychological change).`
    *   `Might rise within  Beetriot's hierarchy, or suffer a fall from grace depending on her successes and failures (Social/Axiological change). `
    *   `Could become a key figure in exposing or confronting the "invisible women" conspiracy, or fall  prey to it herself (Epistemic/Social change).`
