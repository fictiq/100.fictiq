## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm . Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by  the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

* Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity  arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the  specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties ( Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence within Primal Mama.*
     *   `- Appearance_General: [Human male, appears late 50s/early 60s, weathered  face from sun and swamp air, wiry build but with a stoop of someone who carries burdens or spends much time in contemplation .]` # Auth: [This Entry]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Kind, clear blue  eyes that hold a deep weariness but also a spark of conviction. Thinning grey hair, often damp from humidity. Pron ounced Adam's apple.]` # Auth: [This Entry]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [ Calloused hands, not just from prayer books but from mending things around his small chapel in Lickskillet. A  faint, old scar across his chin from a 'misunderstanding' in his younger, more fiery days.]` # Auth: [This  Entry]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Simple, often mended, button-up shirt (perhaps  a faded plaid or solid earth tone), durable denim or canvas trousers tucked into practical swamp boots. For services, he dons  a slightly threadbare but clean, dark brown polyester suit jacket that screams late 1970s thrift store.]` #  Auth: [This Entry / Primal Mama Codex: 1970s Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Voice/ Speech Pattern: [Warm, resonant baritone with a distinct, unhurried bayou drawl. Speech is plain , direct, often quoting scripture (or what passes for it post-Calamity) or folksy wisdom. Cap able of rising to fervent passion during sermons delivered through a chunky, microphone with a coiled cord.]` # Auth: [This Entry  / Primal Mama Codex: 1970s Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Gait/Manner isms: [Slow, deliberate walk. Often clasps his hands. Has a habit of looking up at the sky ( or the thick canopy) as if seeking guidance or sighing at the state of the world. Will polish his glasses ( if he wears them, TBD) with a handkerchief.]` # Auth: [This Entry]
    *    `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Faint smell of damp earth, old books, and perhaps a hint of the  cheap, woody incense he burns in his chapel to combat the swamp's miasma.]` # Auth: [This  Entry]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/weight, specific brand of boots, presence /absence of eyeglasses regularly.]`

   *Purpose:  Define what Pastor Jeb *can* and *cannot* do within Primal Mama's rules.*

    *    `- Skill: [Community Counseling & Mediation (Offers solace and guidance to his small flock, often dealing with fear of  the swamp, grief, or social friction not involving meat oligarchs directly).]` # Auth: [This Entry]
    *    `- Skill: [Basic Herbalism/Folk Medicine (Learned from swamp dwellers, for minor ailments when ' town' remedies are scarce or mistrusted).]` # Auth: [This Entry]
    *   `- Skill: [ Rudimentary Repair of 1970s-era Solar Tech (Can keep his chapel's lights and PA  system functional with salvaged parts and prayer).]` # Auth: [This Entry / Primal Mama Codex: Solar Dominance , 1970s Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Ability (Unique): [None supernatural. His  'power' is derived from faith and conviction, which can inspire resilience in others but adheres to Primal Mama's  natural laws.]` # Auth: [This Entry / Primal Mama Codex]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Limited  understanding of advanced GE bio-engineering (beyond "God's creatures, tampered with"). Skeptical of and  largely ignorant about the inner workings of Beetriot's elite or the full extent of the meat oligarchy's power.]` #  Auth: [This Entry]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Not a fighter; relies on words and faith . Subject to the frailties of age and the harsh swamp environment.]` # Auth: [This Entry]
     *   `- Limitation (Social/Influence): [His influence is largely confined to his small congregation in Lickskillet. Viewed  as anachronistic or harmless by most outsiders. No sway with meat oligarchs or Beetriot elites.]` # Auth : [This Entry / Primal Mama Codex: Deontic/Axiological Rules]
    *   `- Limitation (Resources ): [His chapel, "The Last Light Chapel," operates on meagre donations (often bartered goods like gator jerky or  useful scrap). Struggles to acquire 'modern' 1970s tech components.]` # Auth: [This Entry ]

    *   `- Internal Conflict: [His love for his community vs. his condemnation of their embrace  of celebrity deities or 'superstitions'; his desire for a simpler faith vs. the overwhelming, complex spiritual miasma of Primal  Mama; weariness vs. the call to duty.]` # Auth: [This Entry]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize  the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:**  `Pastor Jebediah Stone is constituted as a relic of an older faith, a man of sincere Christian conviction (as it  has survived and been interpreted in post-Calamity Primal Mama) striving to offer spiritual guidance in a world dominated  by bizarre new deities, pervasive swamp magic, and retro-futuristic anxieties. His existence is a quiet but persistent challenge  to Primal Mama's dominant axiological and epistemic norms. He finds meaning in his steadfastness, his service  to a small flock, and his belief in a divine order that transcends the tangible, solar-powered, alligator-fueled  reality around him. His understanding of God, sin, and salvation is filtered through the lens of the Biological Calamity,  the 1970s aesthetic that defines "proper" things, and the ever-present spiritual miasma of  the bayou.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `[Moral counterpoint to the prevailing Primal Mama culture;  spiritual guide for characters seeking alternatives to celebrity worship or swamp magic; source of conflict when his beliefs clash with others'; potential provider  of forgotten lore or a different perspective on the Calamity; symbol of enduring human need for faith and meaning even in the strang est of worlds.]`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `[Faith vs. Despair at  the state of the world; Duty to preach Truth vs. Prudence in a world hostile to his message; Compassion for individuals  vs. Condemnation of their beliefs/practices (e.g., celebrity worship, witchcraft); Adherence to tradition  vs. Need to adapt to survive in Primal Mama.]`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle): ** `[Could discover texts or relics that recontextualize his faith for Primal Mama; might be forced into  an uneasy alliance with 'unholy' elements (e.g., a Swamp Witch, an Erpenthrope) for  a greater good; his faith could be severely tested by a direct confrontation with the 'divine' power of a celebrity god 's manifestations or the deeper truths of the Calamity; could inspire a revival or bemartyred for his beliefs.]`
