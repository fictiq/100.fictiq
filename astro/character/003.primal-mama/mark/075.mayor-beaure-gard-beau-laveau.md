## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm . Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by  the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition** .*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose  complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific,  validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory  Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General : [e.g., Human male, late 50s but meticulously maintained. Stocky, imposing build,  often looks like he's about to burst out of his expensive, tailored suits. Hairpiece impeccably coiffed  in a 1970s power style.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Visual Style inferred  from 70s Aesthetic]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [e.g., Ruddy complexion , fleshy face with small, shrewd eyes. A smile that rarely reaches his eyes, often more a baring of teeth.  Prominent gold rings on several fingers.]` # Auth: [Visual Concept]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks:  [e.g., A faint, almost invisible scar along his jawline, rumored to be from "early business negotiations ." Wears a solid gold alligator tooth pendant.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Alligator Meat economy ]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [e.g., Custom-tailored leisure suits in shades of brown , mustard, or avocado green, always with a wide, patterned tie. Polished alligator-skin boots (non-GE , "vintage pre-calamity" if he can get them, or highest-grade GE otherwise, a subtle  display of dominance over the primary resource). Often seen with a chunky, gold-plated "communicator" (styled like a 7 0s CB radio handset) that connects to his private network.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex -  1970s Tech Aesthetic & Alligator Meat Economy]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [e.g ., Smooth, honeyed baritone with a pronounced, folksy Southern drawl when public-facing, which can turn  sharp and menacing in private. Master of the backhanded compliment and veiled threat.]` # Auth: [Dialogue Concept]
    *    `- Gait/Mannerisms: [e.g., Confident, slightly swaggering gait. Expansive gestures . Habit of patting people on the back a little too hard. Constantly adjusting his tie or shooting his cuffs.]` #  Auth: [Action Description]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [e.g., Expensive , slightly overpowering 1970s-style cologne, cigar smoke (even if not actively smoking), and the  faint, underlying metallic tang of Beetriot industry.]` # Auth: [Sensory Palette]
    *   `#  Physical Undersaturation: [e.g., Exact height/weight; specific brand of hairpiece; details of his private  security force's appearance.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**

    *   `- Skill: [e.g.,  Masterful Oratory & Public Manipulation (Charisma)]` # Auth: [Demonstrated in public addresses within Beetriot]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Mayor Beau Laveau is constituted  as the personification of Primal Mama's urban decay and corrupt power, a tyrant ruling Beetriot through a carefully  crafted 1970s charismatic facade that masks profound greed, paranoia, and ruthlessness. He controls the city' s economic lifeblood (alligator meat processing, solar power distribution) and maintains his grip via propaganda, a loyal security  force, and the exploitation of the Deontic (cattle laws, Automaton stigma) and Axiological (70s aesthetic , perhaps even manipulating reverence for deified celebrities) systems of the world. His ownership of priceless artifact cattle is the ultimate symbol of his  decadent power.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `Antagonist. Represents systemic oppression and corruption. He is the  face of the forces seeking to control and exploit the world's resources and people, particularly those in Lickskillet and the  independent swamp communities. He serves as a major obstacle to any protagonists seeking freedom, truth (especially Erpenthropes), or equitable  existence.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Maintaining his populist image vs. his despotic actions . Fear of exposure of his clandestine activities (e.g., LLM use). Paranoia about losing control to rivals , swamp elements, or popular uprising. The psychological dissonance of demanding adherence to a 1970s aesthetic while  secretly desiring ever more advanced (hidden) tools of control.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** ` His downfall through exposure or rebellion. Escalation of his tyranny in response to threats. Being outmaneuvered by Er penthropes' pursuit of truth or Swamp Witches' esoteric power. His paranoia leading to self-destructive decisions . A potential (though unlikely) shift if faced with a threat great enough to require uneasy alliances.`
