# Story World Codex: Fictional Person Constitution Protocol
 # Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

 **World:** Primal Mama
**Codex Version:** 0.2 - Character Constitution (Wade Johnson)
**Last  Updated:** [Current Date]

## Introduction : Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters , significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by  the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no  independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties  across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle **, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence .*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Human male, mid-40s, with pronounced African features:  dark skin, broad nose, full lips. Once powerfully built from manual labor in alligator processing, now gaunt and wir y, carrying the weight of loss.]` # Auth: [Narrative Design]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features : [Tightly coiled black hair, heavily flecked with grey, often unkempt. Deep-set, tired  eyes that constantly scan his surroundings with a mix of fear and resentment. Prominent brow, often furrowed.]` # Auth:  [Narrative Design]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [A faded, jagged scar running from  his left temple down his cheek – an old gator-handling injury. Hands are calloused and scarred but tremble slightly. Several  missing teeth, a result of a "persuasion" tactic by oligarchy enforcers.]` # Auth: [Back story Element, Primal Mama Coherence - Oligarchy]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Worn, patched- up denim overalls over a faded, oil-stained thermal shirt (classic 1970s workwear aesthetic). Heavy , cracked swamp boots.

    *   `- Voice/ Speech Pattern: [Deep, resonant voice, now often raspy and low, tinged with a Lickskillet regional  drawl. Speaks slowly, deliberately, as if words are too heavy. Prone to muttering under his breath.]`  # Auth: [Dialogue Direction / Primal Mama Coherence - Lickskillet]
    *   `- Gait/M annerisms: [A noticeable limp, favoring his right leg (another "reminder" from oligarchy enforcers). Moves  with a hunted, cautious air. Flinches at loud noises or sudden movements. Wrings his hands or rubs his  temples when agitated.]` # Auth: [Backstory Element, Action Description]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Wade "Gatorbait" Johnson is constituted as a man systematically broken by the brutal socio -economic realities of Primal Mama, specifically the unchecked power of the Meat Oligarchy. His identity is forged in loss , injustice, and the corrosive effects of fear and resentment. His physical and psychological scars are direct authentications of his victim hood. His belief in the "invisible women" conspiracy is a desperate attempt to make sense of a world where mundane greed  inflicts catastrophic suffering, showcasing the epistemic fragility of the oppressed.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To  embody the human cost of the Oligarchy's dominance in Lickskillet; to serve as a potent example of the 'friction ' they cause for mom-and-pop operations; a potential (if reluctant or damaged) source of information or catalyst  for action for protagonists opposing the status quo; to illustrate the spread and psychological appeal of conspiracy theories among the dispossessed.` 
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The burning desire for retribution vs. the paralyzing fear of the  Oligarchy's power; The memory of his former pride and independence vs. the shame of his current state; The  rational understanding of his oppressors vs. the seductive narrative of the "invisible women" conspiracy; The instinct to trust potential  allies vs. ingrained paranoia.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be pushed to a  desperate act of rebellion (Social/Functional change); Could find a new, albeit grim, purpose in exposing the Oligarchy (Psych ological/Social change); Could succumb entirely to paranoia and conspiracy (Psychological change); Could be "rescued" or  offered a path to small vengeance by more powerful actors (e.g., Erpenthropes, protagonists), altering  his Social and Functional properties.`
