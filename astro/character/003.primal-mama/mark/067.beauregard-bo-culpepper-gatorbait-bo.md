# Based on Doležel's Heter ocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm . Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by  the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition** .*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity  arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

 ### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from  the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Bo "Gatorbait" Culpepper is constituted as a quintessential  Lickskillet survivor, embodying the gritty resilience, ingrained suspicion, and fierce independence of those living on the fringes of  Primal Mama's strange society. His existence is a constant struggle against the encroaching meat oligarchy, powered by jury -rigged 1970s solar tech and a deep-seated belief in self-reliance, local traditions  (including celebrity reverence and conspiracy theories), and the absolute taboo of cattle consumption. He is a man defined by his environment:  the swamp, the GE alligators he processes, and the socio-economic pressures of a world rebuilt on bizarre foundations.` 
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a viewpoint character for life in Lickskillet, illustrating  the daily realities and struggles of independent operators. He can act as a source of local knowledge, a reluctant ally or obstacle for protagonists,  and a tangible representation of the "friction" caused by the meat oligarchy. His adherence to the 197 0s aesthetic and local beliefs grounds these world elements in a lived experience.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle): ** `Stubborn Pride vs. Practical Need for Survival (e.g., dealing with oligarchy); Traditional Methods vs. Pressure  to Modernize (within 1970s tech limits); Suspicion of Outsiders vs. Potential Need for Help ; Folk Beliefs/Conspiracies vs. Harsh Realities.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):**  `Bo could be pushed to the brink by the oligarchy, forcing him to either make a desperate stand (perhaps rallying  other small operators), seek unconventional allies (even those he distrusts, like someone with 'stigma' tech or even  contact with fringe elements like Witches/Erpenthropes if desperate enough), or be forced to sell out/ adapt in a way that compromises his core values. Discovery of information that challenges his conspiracy beliefs or offers a true path to  resistance could also drive change.`
