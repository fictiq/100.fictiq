# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character  as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed  definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole žel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the  **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heter ocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character 's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Human male, mid-40s, with pronounced  African features – broad nose, full lips, dark skin tone. Appears older than his years due to hardship; lean, almost  gaunt frame.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Deep -set, weary brown eyes that often carry a haunted look. Tight, curly black hair, greying significantly at the temples and  in his short, unkempt beard.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinct ive Marks: [A faded, poorly healed scar across the back of his left hand, a memento from a struggling  gator on his old farm. Calloused hands, though softer now from disuse.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
     *   `- Typical Attire: [Worn, patched-up denim overalls over a threadbare, faded plaid  work shirt (1970s style). Scuffed, nearly soleless work boots. Often carries a grimy, wide -brimmed straw hat against the swamp sun.]` # Auth: [This Codex - Visual Palette consistent with L ickskillet & 1970s aesthetic]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Soft -spoken, with a slight, lingering tremor. Speech is often hesitant, punctuated by sighs. Possesses a deep bar itone that rarely finds its full volume anymore. Hints of a once-proud, more confident cadence.]` # Auth:  [This Codex]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Slightly stooped posture, as  if carrying a heavy weight. Moves slowly, deliberately. Tends to avoid direct eye contact, especially with figures of authority or perceived  wealth. Fidgets with the brim of his hat when nervous.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
     *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Faint, lingering smell of swamp mud, stale sweat, and the ghost  of alligator musk from his past life.]` # Auth: [This Codex - Sensory Palette of Lickskillet] 
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/weight, specific details of non-work clothing ( if any), precise nature of any non-scar injuries from past.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations ):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*
    *    `- Skill (Past): [Once proficient in small-scale alligator husbandry – breeding, feeding (pre-solar GE dominance ), and ethical harvesting. Knew basic swamp navigation by flatboat.]` # Auth: [Backstory based on Pr imal Mama economy]
    *   `- Skill (Past): [Competent in butchering and primary processing of alligator  meat with older, 1970s-style analog machinery.]` # Auth: [Backstory based on Primal  Mama tech aesthetic]
    *   `- Skill (Lingering): [Basic repair of simple, analog 1970 s-era mechanical devices (a holdover from maintaining his own equipment).]` # Auth: [Backstory, Primal  Mama Tech Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Weakened by poor nutrition and prolonged stress;  not suited for heavy manual labor anymore. Suffers from recurring swamp-fevers.]` # Auth: [Victim status  impact]
    *   `- Limitation (Economic): [Penniless. No assets after his small farm/processing unit  was 'acquired' by agents of a meat oligarchy member. Effectively blacklisted from formal work in the gator industry in  Lickskillet.]` # Auth: [Deontic rules (Oligarchy Power), Victim status]
     *   `- Limitation (Social): [Carries the unspoken stigma of failure in Lickskillet; some whisper he tried  to cut corners or use 'unproven methods' (possibly a misunderstood attempt at efficiency that was twisted by competitors). Marginal ized, lacks influential contacts.]` # Auth: [Social dynamics, Axiological implications]
    *   `- Limitation ( Knowledge): [Unaware of the true extent of the meat oligarchy's power or inner workings. Limited knowledge of anything  outside Lickskillet or basic swamp survival. No formal education in GE or advanced solar tech.]` # Auth: [Ep istemic limits of his social sphere]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Specifics of his ' unproven methods', ability to use firearms (though gun ownership is common outside Beetriot, his current state might preclude it), literacy  level.]`

    *   `- Core Trait: [Resignation / Deep-seated Wear iness]` # Auth: [Physical description, mannerisms]

    *   `- Key Belief: [Believes the 'little guy' has no chance  against the powerful; that the system is rigged by entities like the meat oligarchy.]` # Auth: [Result of his experiences ]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [The desire to fight back or speak out vs. the paralyzing fear of further  retribution and the crushing weight of his current powerlessness. Pride in past work vs. shame of current state.]` # Auth : [Plausible conflict for a victim]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Vivid,  often painful, memories of his thriving farm, the smell of his own processing unit, the faces of the men who strong -armed him out. Fragmented, idealized memories of 'better times' before the calamity was fully normalized.]` # Auth : [Backstory elements]

    *   `- Key Relationship 2 (Antagonistic): [Indirectly, to the  regional Meat Oligarchy (specifically, "Slaughterman" Silas's enterprise) – they are the authenticated cause of his ruin , though they likely don't know his name.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama world structure, Deontic  rules]
    *   `- Species/Type: [Human (Baseline, post-Calamity survivor stock)]` # Auth : [Default]

**5 . Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
     *   `[None Authenticated. Jabari operates entirely under the general physical, biological, and societal laws of Primal Mama . His victimhood stems from the application of these laws (economic, social) by more powerful entities, not from any unique  personal modality.]`

    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [Reputation among Swamp  Witches or Erpenthropes (likely none); how the local deified celebrity cultists view his plight ( if at all).]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the  character's known origins and connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as born and raised in the  outskirts of Lickskillet, family were small-time swamp fishers/trappers before the alligator boom.]` # Auth : [Plausible Lickskillet background]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection: [The "L ickskillet Consolidation" – an unacknowledged period a few years prior where larger meat processing interests, backed by olig archy capital, aggressively bought out or forced out smaller independent alligator farms and processors like Jabari's. His ruin is  directly tied to this event.]` # Auth: [Worldbuilding detail for Primal Mama history]
    *   `- Inherited  Items:** [A rusty, non-functional single-shot shotgun (1970s hunting rifle style) his  father owned – a symbol of lost independence and the 'right to self-provide' (Axiological value: Firearms  outside Beetriot). A tattered photograph of his old farm, kept hidden.]` # Auth: [Thematic resonance ]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Specifics of his family history pre-calamity ; details of his attempts to resist the buyout; names of specific individuals who orchestrated his downfall beyond 'agents of the oligarchy '.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Jabari Washington is constituted as a  casualty of Primal Mama's brutal economic realities, specifically the unchecked power of the meat oligarchy in Lickskillet . His identity is shaped by the loss of his livelihood, his skills (alligator farming/processing via 197 0s tech) rendered useless by overwhelming force. He embodies the despair and resignation of those crushed by the system, a living  ghost of Lickskillet's dying independent spirit. His African features ground him visually, while his story reflects a  universal struggle against systemic oppression within Primal Mama's unique bayou-infused, retro-futuristic setting.`
*   ** Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a potent example of the meat oligarchy's detrimental impact on ordinary people; to provide  a ground-level perspective on life in Lickskillet for those outside the power structures; to potentially act as a catalyst or  informant for a protagonist investigating the oligarchy or seeking justice; to embody the theme of lost autonomy and the human cost of unchecked  "progress" or greed.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The crushing weight of Des pair vs. flickering embers of past Pride and a desire for Dignity; Fear of retribution vs. a suppressed longing for Justice  or acknowledgment of his Wrongful Loss; Responsibility for family (implied) vs. utter Inability to provide.`
*   ** Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be spurred to action by a sympathetic outsider or a desperate situation; could find a  new, albeit minor, purpose; could share crucial information about the oligarchy's past methods; or could tragically succumb entirely  to his despair, serving as a grim warning. His knowledge of old Lickskillet ways might become unexpectedly relevant.`
