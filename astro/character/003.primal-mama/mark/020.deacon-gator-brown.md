# Based on Doležel's Heter ocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

**World:** Primal Mama

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

    *   `- Typical  Attire: [Durable, patched-up denim work shirt (often sleeveless, 1970s cut ) or a simple, dark-colored cotton shirt.

    *   `- Inherited Items/Knowledge: [Possesses generations  of swamp wisdom passed down orally, now filtered through his long Erpenthrope life. May carry an old,  1970s-era photograph or memento of a lost loved one that fuels his protective instincts.]` #  Auth: [Character Props, Dialogue]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Deacon "Gator" Brown is constituted as an Erpenthrope deeply woven into the fabric of  Primal Mama's swamp communities. He is a fusion of ancient power and grassroots leadership, a near-immortal being  whose existence is dedicated to the mortal "little folk." His identity is forged in the crucible of resisting the oppressive meat oligarchy, fueled  by a profound sense of justice, a truth-seeking Erpenthrope nature, and a deep love for his people and their  1970s-infused, solar-reliant way of life. He embodies the resilience of the swamp and the enduring  spirit of those who live in harmony with it, against forces that would exploit it.`

Serves as a moral compass,  a source of wisdom and hope for the oppressed. Embodies the themes of community, justice, resilience, and the complex  relationship between humanity, nature, and strange powers in Primal Mama.

    *   `Reconciling his inherent distrust of overarching authority with the necessity of organized resistance.`
