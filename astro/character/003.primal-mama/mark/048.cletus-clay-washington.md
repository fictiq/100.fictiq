## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

 *This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heter ocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them ** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition **.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating  multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize  the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:**  `Cletus "Clay" Washington is constituted as a living testament to the devastating intersection of unchecked corporate power (Meat  Oligarchy) and weaponized societal paranoia (the "Invisible Women" conspiracy) within Primal Mama. His identity is forged  in loss: lost livelihood (Functional), lost reputation (Axiological), lost social standing (Social), and lost hope  (Psychological). He is a man whose skills and adherence to the world's accepted technological norms (70s aesthetic , solar power) were twisted into evidence of unnatural influence. His existence demonstrates the fragility of truth and security for the common individual  in Lickskillet.*
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To embody the human cost of Primal Mama's  socio-economic and epistemic dysfunctions. Serves as a cautionary tale, a potential source of information (if trust  can be gained) about the oligarchy's methods and the conspiracy's real-world impact. His plight can  motivate other characters or highlight the stakes of challenging the established order. He could also, if pushed far enough or offered a sli ver of hope, become a catalyst for localized resistance or truth-seeking.*
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):**  `The desire for justice/truth vs. the paralyzing fear of further harm. The memory of his former, capable self vs . his current broken state. The instinct to warn or help others vs. the learned behavior of isolation for survival. The bitterness  towards his community vs. a residual longing for acceptance.*
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Finding  a trustworthy ally who sees his true character (Social/Relational change). Slowly overcoming his fear to share crucial information ( Psychological/Functional change). Discovering concrete evidence of how he was framed (Epistemic shift). Finding a new , albeit small, purpose that reclaims a fraction of his dignity (Psychological/Axiological change). Becoming a reluctant  symbol or voice for other victims.*
