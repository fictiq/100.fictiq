## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of ** Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex,  core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters  by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness,  coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world' s rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity,  internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Agnes "Mama  Gator" Beauregard is constituted as the tenacious heart of Lickskillet's traditional alligator processing economy. She is a  pragmatic, fiercely independent woman whose identity is interwoven with her craft, her 1970s-aesthetic business, and her  bayou community. Her Functional expertise in alligator butchery and small-scale business is constantly tested by the Economic limitations imposed  by the meat oligarchy. Psychologically, she embodies resilience and a deep-seated belief in "honest work," drawing  on a culturally ingrained reverence for Southern ideals (as filtered through the celebrity deities) and a distrust of impersonal corporate power and advanced , "soulless" tech like Automatons. Her Social position as a respected local leader provides a counterpoint to  the faceless oligarchy.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To represent the "mom-and-pop" sector of  Primal Mama's core economy; to embody the spirit and struggles of Lickskillet; to act as a source  of local knowledge, quests, or aid for protagonists; to highlight the socio-economic "friction" created by the meat olig archy and the tension between tradition and external pressures.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Maintaining independence vs . economic survival pressures from the oligarchy; Upholding traditional methods vs. the need to adapt (within 70s tech  limits) to remain viable; Loyalty to community vs. personal weariness/desire for a simpler life (potential).`
*    **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could become a focal point for local resistance against the oligarchy ( Social/Relational change); Might be forced to make a difficult alliance or adopt a risky new (but still 70s -tech) processing method (Functional/Economic change); Could pass on her knowledge/business to a new generation (Historical /Legacy change).`
