## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed  definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole žel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the ** richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and  the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Human male, late  50s, lean and weathered from swamp life, with a wiry strength.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama  World Context]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Deep-set, earnest eyes that seem to hold both profound  faith and deep sorrow. A salt-and-pepper, neatly trimmed beard, conforming to a slightly 1970 s style. Sunken cheeks.]` # Auth: [Visual Concept]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks:  [A small, faded scar in the shape of a gator bite on his left forearm, received years ago. W ears a handcrafted gator-tooth cross, polished smooth, on a leather thong – its points dulled.]` # Auth:  [Backstory Detail, Visual Detail]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Simple, durable clothing in earthy  tones, often denim or canvas, with a slightly retro cut (e.g., wide-collared work shirt, slightly flared  tough-spun trousers). Always wears sturdy, waterproof boots. Possesses a single, well-kept but visibly mended polyester  leisure suit (muted brown with orange stitching) for "high holy days" or significant services.]` # Auth: [Pr imal Mama 1970s Aesthetic, World Context]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [A  warm, resonant baritone with a distinct Cajun/Southern drawl. Speech is measured, often incorporating parables drawn from both  traditional scripture and swamp life. Can rise to impassioned oratory during sermons.]` # Auth: [Regional Influence, Role ]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Steady, deliberate gait, comfortable on uneven swamp ground. Often  clasps his hands or gestures emphatically when speaking of his faith. A habit of looking upwards slightly when in deep thought or  prayer.]` # Auth: [Character Concept]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [F aint smell of swamp water, sweetgrass, and old hymn books (papyrus-analog and magnetic tape reels).]`  # Auth: [Sensory Palette - Primal Mama]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [ Exact height/weight, specific brand of boots, childhood illnesses.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations ):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*
    *    `- Skill: [Oratory & Preaching (Masterful – able to inspire, comfort, and gently admonish his  small flock with reinterpreted scripture and local parables)]` # Auth: [Role Definition]
    *   `- Skill:  [Knowledge of "The Good Book" (a post-Calamity compilation of surviving Christian texts and locally relevant oral  traditions/interpretations, stored on data-cassettes and hand-scribed scrolls)]` # Auth: [Character Concept , Epistemic Rules of Primal Mama]
    *   `- Skill: [Basic Ritual Magic (Christianized  – performing blessings, consecrations, and simple "warding" rituals against malevolent spirits or "unclean influences"  using holy water (filtered swamp water), solar-charged salt, and specific verses. Distinct from Swamp Witch magic.)]` # Auth:  [Primal Mama Spectral Interaction, Christian Tradition Adaptation]
    *   `- Skill: [Small Congregation Leadership & Pastoral Care ( mediating disputes, offering counsel, organizing community support within Lickskillet or similar settlements)]` # Auth: [Role Definition ]
    *   `- Skill: [Basic Swamp Survival & Small Watercraft Piloting (necessary for his ministry in the  bayous)]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Environment]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Limited  understanding of advanced GE technology or Beetriot high society. His theology struggles to fully encompass Erpenthrope nature beyond " mysterious creations." Views Automaton/LLM use with theological suspicion ("idols of false intellect").]` # Auth: [Social  Position, World Axiology]
    *   `- Limitation (Resources): [Operates with very few material resources, relying  on the support of his congregation (often paid in gator jerky, repaired tools, or solar battery recharges).]` # Auth:  [Social Context]
    *   `- Limitation (Influence): [Little to no influence over the meat oligarchy or Beet riot authorities; his authority is purely local and spiritual.]` # Auth: [World Power Dynamics]
    *   `#  Functional Undersaturation: [Ability to repair complex 1970s tech, proficiency in firearms (though likely  owns a simple shotgun for protection as per local norms).]`

**3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's textually constituted inner life.*
    *   `- Core Trait: [ Unshakeable (though often tested) Faith in a benevolent, if inscrutable, Creator God who works through the Primal Mama world 's strange ways.]` # Auth: [Character Concept]
    *   `- Core Trait: [Deep  Compassion & Empathy (for his flock and even those outside it, understanding their struggles in a harsh world).]` # Auth:  [Role, Actions]
    *   `- Core Trait: [Pragmatic Adaptability (Willing to  reinterpret doctrine to find meaning and guidance in the post-Calamity reality).]` # Auth: [Survival in Primal Mama] 
    *   `- Dominant Emotion: [A resilient Hope, tinged with a profound understanding of suffering and loss .]` # Auth: [Narrative Tone for Character]
    *   `- Key Motivator: [To guide  his flock towards "The Light" (as he understands it, often solar-themed), provide solace, and maintain a moral  compass in a chaotic world. To understand God's plan post-Calamity.]` # Auth: [Role , Stated Beliefs]
    *   `- Key Belief: [The Biological Calamity was a divine act , a "Great Flood" or "Purging Fire," necessitating a New Covenant. Alligator meat is God's new  Manna. Cattle flesh is a "Forbidden Fruit," its consumption a grave sin leading to spiritual and physical corruption (align s with societal taboo).]` # Auth: [World Modalities Reinterpreted]
    *   `- Key Belief:  [The Deified Trio (Reynolds, Reed, Parsons) are not gods, but perhaps "Guiding Spirits" or "Post -Calamity Prophets" whose tales offer moral lessons, or even "Angels of the South" if interpreted char itably. He preaches caution against idolatry, emphasizing the One True God above all.]` # Auth: [Primal  Mama Axiology, Theological Adaptation]
    *   `- Key Belief: [Solar power is a direct blessing, "The Light of  the New World." Ghosts are real, and some are lost souls needing prayer, while others might be demonic influences requiring exorcism  (his rituals). Erpenthropes are a mystery, perhaps "Old Ones" or beings touched by a different  aspect of the divine, to be treated with cautious respect.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Modalities Reinterpreted]
     *   `- Internal Conflict: [Reconciling traditional Christian tenets of forgiveness and love with the harsh necessities of survival in Pr imal Mama. Grappling with the "truth" of Swamp Witch magic – demonic, or just another path the Creator allows ? Fear that his interpretations might be leading his flock astray.]` # Auth: [Narrative Potential]
    *    `- Subjective Memory Content: [Vivid memories of post-Calamity struggles, learning to survive in the swamp,  and the gradual formation of his adapted faith. Faded, almost dreamlike recollections of pre-Calamity religious texts  and practices, which he constantly tries to reconcile with the present.]` # Auth: [Character Backstory]
     *   `# Psychological Undersaturation: [Specific childhood experiences, personal vanity, opinions on specific 1970 s music genres beyond hymns.]`

    *Purpose: Define the character's place within the world's networks.*
    *   `- Official Role : [Pastor of "The First Solar Sanctified Chapel of the Resurrected Bayou" (or similar humble, locally named congregation ), likely in Lickskillet or a smaller outlying settlement.]` # Auth: [Character Concept]
    *   `- Social  Status: [Respected spiritual leader within his small community; viewed as an eccentric but harmless anachronism by outsiders or more  secular elements (e.g., some meat processors). Likely viewed with suspicion by adherents of the Celebrity Cults if his interpretations  are seen as challenging.]` # Auth: [World Social Dynamics]
    *   `- Primary Affiliation: [ His independent congregation. Loosely connected to a (hypothetical) small, scattered network of similar "Post-Calam ity Christian" groups.]` # Auth: [Character Concept]
    *   `- Key Relationship 1: [His  Flock (e.g., mom-and-pop gator farmers, swamp scavengers): Protective, guiding, deeply  connected.]` # Auth: [Role]
    *   `- Key Relationship 2: [Local Swamp Witch( es): Uneasy truce, mutual (grudging) respect for different kinds of spiritual power. He may see them as misguided  or even dabbling in darkness, but also recognizes their role in the swamp's ecosystem of belief.]` # Auth : [Primal Mama Entities]
    *   `- Key Relationship 3: [Meat Oligarchy Representatives (if encountered ): Distrustful. He might preach against their exploitative practices, framing it as "greed" and "leading  the flock astray from simple sustenance."]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Deontic Friction]
    *   `- Species/ Type: [Human (Baseline Primal Mama Strain)]` # Auth: [Default]
    *   `# Social  Undersaturation: [Specific names of all congregation members; precise relationship with Beetriot authorities (likely non-existent or  dismissive).]`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique  relationship to world laws.*
    *   `- Property ID: N/A`
        *   *Property:* ` [None authenticated beyond the typical human ability to learn and perform basic, culturally understood ritual magic for spectral interaction, which in  his case is filtered through a Christian lens.]`
        *   *Description:* `[Operates fully under general  Primal Mama world rules and modalities.]`
        *   *Limits:* `[N/A]`
        *    *Authentication:* `[Absence of evidence for unique modal exceptions.]`
    *   `# Note: Pastor  Zeke's "power" comes from faith, oratory, and community, not unique exceptions to world laws.`

**6.  Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's value status *within* Pr imal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Local Community/Lickskillet): [Authenticated as viewed as a  pillar of moral strength, a comforter, a wise (if somewhat old-fashioned) counsel. His chapel is a place  of sanctuary and community.]` # Auth: [Role and Actions]
    *   `- Reputation (Meat Oligarchy/ Outsiders): [Authenticated as potentially viewed as an oddity, a harmless fanatic, or (if he speaks out against them ) a minor agitator stirring up "simple folk" with outdated notions.]` # Auth: [World Power Dynamics]
     *   `- Reputation (Celebrity Deity Adherents): [Could be viewed with suspicion or as heretical if he  doesn't fully endorse the divinity of Reynolds, Reed, and Parsons. His nuanced "prophets/angels" view  might be tolerated by some, condemned by zealots.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Axiology]
    *    `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via narrative sympathy as genuinely striving for good, compassion, and truth  as he understands it, serving his community selflessly within the Primal Mama context. His reinterpretation of faith is a coping  mechanism and source of strength.]` # Auth: [Narrative Intent]
    *   `# Axiological Unders aturation: [Specific opinions of Erpenthropes about him; reputation among the "invisible women" conspiracy theorists.] `

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and  connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: [Likely born post-Calamity or was very  young during it. Authenticated as having learned "Old Faith" fragments from a predecessor or rediscovered texts (data-cassettes,  salvaged printouts) and adapted them.]` # Auth: [Character Concept, Primal Mama Timeline]
    *    `- Key Past Event Connection: [His ministry is a direct response to the Biological Calamity and the subsequent societal shifts.  He feels a divine calling to make sense of this changed world through the lens of his adapted faith.]` # Auth: [Character  Motivation]
    *   `- Inherited Items:** [Authenticated to possess a worn "Good Book" (as described in  Functional Properties), his gator-tooth cross (self-made after a pivotal event), and the charter for his chapel  (perhaps a hand-painted sign or a formal-looking document printed on a 1970s dot- matrix printer using gator-hide parchment analog).]` # Auth: [Character Details]
    *   `# Historical  Undersaturation: [Details of his specific lineage; identity of his mentor in the faith; the exact year his chapel was founded.] `

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Pastor Ezekiel Thorne is constituted as a beacon of  adapted faith in the spiritually eclectic and hazardous world of Primal Mama. His being is defined by the tension between inherited Christian  tradition and the stark, authenticated realities of his environment (GE gators, celebrity "saints," tangible ghosts, the cattle  taboo). His Functional knowledge (reinterpreted scripture, basic ritual) and Psychological drive (faith, compassion, pragmatism) are  geared towards shepherding a flock through a world where God's will seems expressed in solar power and alligator abundance. His  Social role as a local pastor places him in a unique position to comment on and interact with the world's core De ontic (cattle laws, oligarchy) and Axiological (celebrity worship, tech stigma) rules from a spiritual perspective , offering an alternative, albeit niche, system of belief.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `Moral compass for a  segment of the population; source of spiritual comfort and alternative interpretations of world events; potential voice of dissent against purely materialistic or hedon istic trends; can provide exposition on how "old world" beliefs have mutated or survived; represents humanity's enduring need for  faith and meaning-making even in bizarre circumstances.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Faith  vs. Doubt (especially when confronted with phenomena his theology can't easily explain, like Erpenthropes or  complex Swamp Witch magic); Tradition vs. Adaptation (how much can scripture bend before it breaks?); Compassion vs. Judgment  (how to minister to those who embrace "false idols" like the Deified Trio fully, or use "unclean" Automat ons).`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `His theology could evolve further through encounters  with Erpenthropes or deeper understanding of Swamp Witch practices. He might face a crisis of faith if his interpretations are devastating ly proven wrong or insufficient. He could become a more prominent figure if his message resonates more widely, or be persecuted if  deemed a threat by established powers/cults. He might uncover "lost" pre-Calamity Christian knowledge that challenges or  enriches his current understanding.`
