##  Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters , significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by  the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent  psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties  across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated  bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**:  define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property  Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1 . Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.* 
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Human male, indeterminate age (appears 50s-60s but  deeply weathered), lean and wiry from ascetic lifestyle. Skin tanned and creased like old leather from sun and swamp exposure.]`  # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Environmental Impact]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features:  [Kind, deeply-set eyes, often squinting as if looking for something distant or subtle. Long, unkempt  grey-streaked beard and hair, sometimes bound with woven swamp grass. Prominent Adam's apple.]` # Auth:  [Visual Concept]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [Faint, intricate spiral tattoo (stylized alligator  tail or solar flare?) on one forearm, done with natural pigments. Hands calloused and stained from foraging and ritual work .]` # Auth: [Visual Detail, links to world motifs]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Simple , patched homespun robes/tunic made from rough, sun-bleached fabric (possibly repurposed canvas or other durable  material, 1970s aesthetic in its utilitarian simplicity). Often barefoot or wearing crude, handmade sandals from alligator  hide scraps. Carries a well-worn satchel, possibly with wood paneling accents or chunky clasps.]` #  Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic, Resourcefulness]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern:  [Slow, measured, calm. A gentle Southern drawl, often uses allegories drawn from nature, the swamp, or  misunderstood fragments of celebrity deity lore. Voice can be surprisingly resonant during "inspired" moments.]` # Auth: [Dialogue Concept ]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Moves with quiet deliberation, at home in swampy terrain . Often pauses to listen or observe intently. Habit of touching the earth or specific plants. Has a ritualistic way of handling  his few possessions.]` # Auth: [Action Description]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any):  [Earthy loam, sun-dried reeds, faint woodsmoke, a hint of ozone from proximity to solar-charged  items or spiritual "energy".]` # Auth: [Sensory Palette]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation:  [Exact height/weight, pre-seeker appearance, specific dental health.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations ):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*
    *    `- Skill: [Exceptional Swamp Navigation & Foraging (Survival)]` # Auth: [Demonstrated Lifestyle]
    *    `- Skill: [Basic Ritual Magic (Ghost Interaction - for seeking guidance, not control. Methods are eclectic, pie ced together from lore and personal revelation, likely involving solar-focused elements and natural offerings).]` # Auth: [Primal Mama  Coherence - Spectral Interaction, Solar Dominance]
    *   `- Skill: [Herbalism (Rudimentary knowledge of swamp  plants for sustenance and minor remedies, possibly some psychoactive components for visions, aligned with 1970s counter -culture vibe).]` # Auth: [World Flavour]
    *   `- Skill: [Oral Storytelling /  Spiritual Counsel (Can weave compelling, if cryptic, narratives about the "Great Hum" or "Mama's Breath" –  his names for the divine essence).]` # Auth: [Character Role]
    *   `- Ability (Unique): [ Heightened Sensitivity to 'Spiritual Currents' (Feels shifts in the "miasma," presence of strong emotions, or  places of spiritual significance. This is more intuitive than Erpenthrope truth-sense.)]` # Auth: [Primal  Mama Coherence - Spiritual Miasma, Modal Property Link]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Not  physically strong or a fighter; relies on evasion, local goodwill, or perceived harmlessness.]` # Auth: [Character  Concept]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Lacks formal education or deep technical understanding of GE, solar tech  (beyond its spiritual significance). Knowledge of celebrity deities is filtered through his own syncretic lens, often unorthodox. Prone to mis interpreting complex phenomena through a purely spiritual framework.]` # Auth: [Character Concept, Epistemic Limits]
    *    `- Limitation (Social): [Generally considered an eccentric outsider; lacks material wealth or official influence. His "congregation" is usually  small, transient, or non-existent.]` # Auth: [Social Status]
    *   `# Functional  Undersaturation: [Ability to pilot watercraft; specific combat skills; literacy level.]`

**3. Psychological Properties ( Authenticated Interiority):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's textually constituted inner life.*
    *   `- Core  Trait: [Deep, Abiding Faith (in an immanent, often inscrutable, divine presence within Primal Mama itself ).]` # Auth: [Core Motivator]
    *   `- Core Trait: [Patient Observance (Bel ieves understanding comes through listening to the world, not forcing it).]` # Auth: [Mannerisms, Actions]
     *   `- Core Trait: [Gentle Compassion (Even for the bizarre or seemingly malevolent aspects of the world,  seeing them as part of a larger, misunderstood whole).]` # Auth: [Interactions, Axiological Framing]
    *    `- Dominant Emotion: [Serene Questing / Hopeful Watchfulness (A deep sense of purpose mixed with acceptance  of mystery).]` # Auth: [Overall Demeanour]
    *   `- Key Motivator: [To  achieve direct communion with the "Primal Mama" / "Great Hum"; to understand its will and share that understanding,  however imperfectly.]` # Auth: [Archetype, Narrative Function]
    *   `- Key Belief: [The Biological  Calamity was a profound, terrible shedding of an old skin, and the current world, including GE gators and celebrity  deities, holds clues to the new divine face. Solar energy is a direct manifestation of divine life-force.]` #  Auth: [Personal Theology, links to World Rules]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [Moments of profound  doubt vs. enduring faith; Reconciling the often harsh, brutal, or absurd nature of the world (e.g., Vampire  Bunnies, death-by-burger) with a benevolent or at least purposeful divine order; Frustration with those who only  see the surface (e.g., literal interpretations of celebrity gods without seeking deeper meaning).]` # Auth: [The matic Depth]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Vivid, impressionistic "visions" or moments  of clarity experienced in nature, during solar flares, or in contact with spectral phenomena. Fragmented understanding of pre-C alamity spiritual texts or celebrity lore, reinterpreted.]` # Auth: [Personal Experience]

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):** 
   *Purpose: Define the character's place within the world's networks.*
    *   `- Official  Role: [None. Self-perceived "Listener" or "Voice" for the Primal Mama.]` # Auth: [ Character Concept]
    *   `- Social Status: [Outsider; holy fool to some, wise hermit to others, char latan or madman to many. Respected in some isolated swamp communities for his harmlessness and occasional insights/aid.]` # Auth : [Axiological link]
    *   `- Primary Affiliation: [To the "Spirit of Primal  Mama" itself (as he perceives it). Loosely, to the natural world and its rhythms.]` # Auth : [Core Belief]
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: [Tenuous, respectful but cautious interactions with Swamp  Witches (sees them as tapping into a related, but perhaps more dangerous, current of power). May occasionally interact with Er penthropes, seeing them as fellow seekers of a different kind of truth.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Co herence - Factions]
    *   `- Key Relationship 1: [To the Natural World/Swamp: A communicative , symbiotic relationship. He "reads" it for signs.]` # Auth: [Core Traits]
    *   `- Key Relationship  2: [To Followers/Listeners (if any): Temporary, based on their need for spiritual solace or his for  sustenance. He does not seek to lead in a conventional sense.]` # Auth: [Narrative Potential]
    *    `- Key Relationship 3: [To Celebrity Deities: Views them as powerful nature spirits, avatars, or ancestral  echoes, aspects of the larger "Primal Mama," rather than ultimate gods in themselves. Might incorporate their imagery or stories  into his own syncretic worship in a 1970s folk-art style.]` # Auth: [A xiological/Epistemic interpretation]
    *   `- Species/Type: [Human (Baseline Primal Mama Strain )]` # Auth: [Default]

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional  Status):**
   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
    *   `- Property ID: MODAL -SILAS-01`
        *   *Property:* `Spiritual Resonance (Epistemic/A xiological Exception)`
        *   *Description:* `An authenticated, heightened sensitivity to the "spiritual miasma" of  Primal Mama. Can intuitively sense places, times, or confluences of events that are "spiritually potent" or where the  "veil" (to ghosts, or divine insight) is thin. This manifests as strong feelings, vivid imagery, or auditory  impressions (the "Great Hum"). Linked to solar cycles and natural phenomena.`
        *   *Limits:* `Highly  subjective and personal; cannot be reliably controlled or directed. Provides intuitive "knowing" rather than factual data. Can be overwhelming  or misleading if not interpreted with care. Does not grant power over spirits or phenomena, only sensitivity to them. Requires a  1970s-era, possibly solar-powered, device (e.g. a modified cassette recorder with  special crystal microphone) to "tune in" or "record" these impressions, even if playback is just static to others .`
        *   *Authentication:* `Narrative depiction of his successful (or meaningfully unsuccessful) seeking based on these  feelings; contrast with other characters' lack of such perception; consistent application of his "tuning" device.`

**6. Axiological  Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's value status *within* Pr imal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Swamp Communities): [Authenticated as viewed variously as 'Old Man Silas', ' that God-touched fella', 'harmless wanderer', 'sometimes speaks true words'. Often tolerated or offered  simple charity.]` # Auth: [Social Interactions]
    *   `- Reputation (Beetriot/Authorities): [Lik ely unknown, or if encountered, dismissed as vagrant, mentally unstable, or a minor nuisance. His rejection of Autom aton/LLM type knowledge would reinforce this.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence - Deontic/A xiological contrasts]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via narrative focus as genuinely seeking a higher  truth and embodying a form of gentle, bewildered holiness within the harsh world. His service is to understanding, not conquest or  judgment.]` # Auth: [Thematic Role]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [Rep utation among Erpenthropes or specific meat oligarchy figures (likely non-existent or dismissive).]`

 **7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections  to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as originating from a small, now-gone fishing/ foraging settlement deep in the bayous, post-Calamity. The settlement was likely wiped out by a localized  disaster or economic collapse, sparking his spiritual quest.]` # Auth: [Backstory Sketch]
    *   `-  Key Past Event Connection (Subjective): [A profound personal experience of loss, followed by a "vision" during a major solar  storm (which he calls "The Great Awakening Sun"), convincing him of an immanent divine presence and setting him on his path . This experience is central to his belief in Solar Dominance as divine.]` # Auth: [Motivator Origin ]
    *   `- Inherited Items:** [Authenticated to possess a single, water-damaged, pre-C alamity book of poetry or philosophy (actual content irrelevant, he "reads" its spirit); a small, smooth river  stone he considers a conduit; his 1970s-style "tuning" device for spiritual resonance, possibly self -made or heavily modified.]` # Auth: [Narrative Inventory, Tech Aesthetic]
    *   `# Historical Unders aturation: [Details of his lost community, specific family members, the exact nature of his pre-vision life.]`

 ### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging  from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Brother Silas is constituted as a living embodiment of Pr imal Mama's "strangely spiritual miasma." He is a seeker defined by his unwavering faith in an immanent,  syncretic divine accessible through nature, solar power, and spectral whispers, interpreted through a 1970s folk- mystic lens. His Functional capabilities (swamp survival, basic ritual, intuition) are all bent towards his Psychological drive  (finding/understanding God). His Social isolation is a consequence of his unique Axiological and Epistemic framework, which sets  him apart yet allows him to perceive what others miss. He is a gentle anachronism, a voice of primal faith  in a retro-futuristic, biologically reshaped world.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a spiritual  counterpoint to the world's materialism and violence; to offer cryptic wisdom or unexpected aid; to embody the theme of finding meaning  in chaos; to potentially guide protagonists towards deeper truths or challenge their assumptions; to interact with and interpret the world's supernatural  elements (ghosts, Erpenthropes, Swamp Witches) from a unique faith-based perspective.`
*   ** Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Sustaining faith amidst overwhelming evidence of a bizarre, indifferent, or hostile  universe; Reconciling personal revelation with the established (and often shallow) worship of celebrity deities; The struggle to articulate  ineffable spiritual experiences to a skeptical world; Fear that his "Great Hum" is merely his own delusion.`
*   ** Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Achieving a breakthrough in his communion (Modal/Epistemic change ); Attracting a small, genuine following (Social change); Facing a crisis of faith due to a traumatic event or undeniable  counter-evidence (Psychological shift); Discovering an unexpected link between his "Primal Mama" and the Erpenthropes ' "Truth" or the Swamp Witches' power (Epistemic/Relational evolution). His interpretation of the " invisible women" conspiracy could be uniquely spiritual, perhaps seeing them as elemental forces or misunderstood spirits.`
