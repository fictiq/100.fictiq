# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character  as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm . Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by  the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition** .*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose  complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Deacon 'Gator' Washington is constituted as the unwavering heart and voice of Primal Mama's  exploited working class, specifically the independent alligator industry of Lickskillet. His identity is forged from a deep connection to the bay ou's traditions (Physical, Historical), mastery of its essential skills (Functional – gator handling, solar tech adaptation ), and an unshakeable moral compass (Psychological – justice, community). He embodies the Primal Mama values of  self-reliance, practical ingenuity within the 1970s aesthetic, and the cultural pride found outside Beetriot ( Axiological, Deontic). His lack of unique Modal properties grounds him firmly among the people he champions, making his stand  against the powerful meat oligarchy (Social, Axiological conflict) a testament to human resilience and communal spirit within this bio -punk Southern Gothic world.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `Protagonist or key supporting protagonist driving storylines of  social justice, community resistance against corporate/oligarchic oppression. Acts as a moral anchor and a guide to the cultural  nuances of Lickskillet and the bayou. Embodies the positive aspects of Primal Mama's core values ( self-reliance, solar ingenuity, respect for the balanced ecosystem, justified firearm ownership).`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts  (From Bundle):** `The burden of leadership vs. personal weariness; The drive for decisive action vs. the need  to protect his community from overwhelming retaliation by the oligarchy; Maintaining hope and unity in the face of relentless economic pressure and the  allure of selling out; Navigating the line between pragmatic alliances (e.g., with certain Witches) and upholding  community values.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be forced to make increasingly difficult moral  compromises in the fight against the oligarchy. Might uncover deeper corruption linking the oligarchy to more sinister aspects of the Primal Mama world  (e.g., misuse of GE tech, hidden truths about the Calamity). Could be instrumental in forging alliances  between disparate marginalized groups (e.g., other small communities, perhaps even disillusioned Erpenthropes if their " truth-seeking" aligns). His relationship with his protégé could lead to intergenerational conflict/understanding regarding tactics and the future.`
