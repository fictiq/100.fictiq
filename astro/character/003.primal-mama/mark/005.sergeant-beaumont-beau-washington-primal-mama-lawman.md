# Based  on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings)  within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from  the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Sergeant Beau Washington is constituted as a deeply rooted, pragmatic lawman  of Lickskillet Parish, embodying the everyday struggle to maintain order and justice in the uniquely strange and often contradictory world  of Primal Mama. His existence is defined by his functional competence within the swamp environment, his adherence to a 197 0s-era law enforcement methodology, and his psychological weariness tempered by an enduring, localized sense of duty. He navig ates the complex social web of a town dominated by the alligator economy and overshadowed by powerful, distant oligarchs, all while contending  with the tangible reality of ghosts, Erpenthropes, and Swamp Witchery. His adherence to the cattle consumption  taboo is absolute, a cornerstone of his understanding of the post-calamity world order.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:**  `Serves as a key local authority figure and potential grounding influence for protagonists. He can act as an information source, an  ally against more overt threats, an obstacle if protagonists operate outside his legal/moral boundaries, or a representation of the " common man's" perspective on Primal Mama's oddities. He embodies the tension between local needs and external  pressures (Oligarchy), and between mundane law and supernatural realities.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):**  `The obligation to enforce all laws vs. empathy for struggling locals exploited by those same laws (via Oligarchy influence). His  innate pragmatism and desire for tangible results vs. the often inexplicable or untouchable nature of supernatural events or high-level corruption . The temptation of cynicism and retirement vs. his ingrained sense of responsibility to his community.`
*   **Potential for Development ( Based on Bundle):** `Could be forced to confront the limits of his authority when facing significant Oligarchy overreach or a major  supernatural crisis. Might learn to collaborate more closely with unconventional allies (Erpenthropes, certain Witches) if faced  with a threat neither can handle alone. Could uncover unsettling truths about local history or the powers that be, pushing his loyalty  and pragmatism to their limits. His views on Automaton/LLM users might be challenged if one proves vital to solving  a critical case.`
