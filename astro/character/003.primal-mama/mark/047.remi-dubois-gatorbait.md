## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides  the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following  Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the  **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence within the bayou-infused retro-future.*
    *    `- Appearance_General: [Human male, mid-40s, with rich dark brown skin and pronounced African  facial features – broad nose, full lips. Wiry but strong build, showing the wear of hard labor and recent hardship.]` #  Auth: [Primal Mama Visual Palette]

    *   `- Typical Attire: [W orn, patched canvas trousers (once a deep swamp green, now faded to mottled brown), a threadbare synth-cotton  shirt (often sleeveless, showing muscular arms), and cracked, perpetually damp swamp boots.

    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [A low, rum bling baritone, usually soft-spoken with a noticeable Lickskillet bayou drawl. Speech is often hesitant , tinged with a deep-seated sadness or simmering resentment. Uses colloquialisms common to swamp dwellers.]` # Auth : [Primal Mama Linguistic Palette]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Moves with a deliberate,  energy-conserving slowness common to those accustomed to humid heat and difficult terrain. Often stares out at the swamp, lost  in thought. Wrings his hands or rubs his temples when stressed.]` # Auth: [Narrative Description]

    *   `- Key Relationship 2: [To Mama Roux (Local Swamp Witch, if encountered): Potential  for cautious, transactional respect if she offers aid or knowledge, or fear if her methods are too alien. He'd be  wary but desperate.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Character Types]

    *   ` # Note: Remi's 'exceptional status' is his complete lack of power against systemic forces, making him a prime  example of the world's socio-economic dynamics.`

   *Purpose: Define Remi's value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *    `- Reputation (Meat Oligarchy / Beetriot Elite): [Authenticated as 'Insignificant collateral damage', 'a failed small -timer', 'proof of our superior efficiency', or simply 'non-existent/forgotten'.]` # Auth: [Impl ied by Oligarchy's actions and values]
    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet Populace): [Authenticated  as 'Poor Gatorbait Remi', 'a walking tragedy', 'what happens when you can't keep up', 'a good  man beat by a bad system'. Some might avoid him, fearing association or bad luck.]` # Auth: [Narrative depiction  of local interactions]

    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [Reputation among Er penthropes or ghosts (likely unknown to them or irrelevant unless his fate intersects with their concerns); how the de ified celebrities might be invoked in relation to his plight by others (e.g., "Not even Burt could save him  from the accountants").]`

   *Purpose: Define the character' s known origins and connections to past events in Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as born  and raised in the Lickskillet delta region, descended from families who adapted to swamp life and small-scale alligator farming  generations after the Biological Calamity.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Historical Context]
    *   `- Key Past Event  Connection: [The 'Consolidation Purge' (local term) by Bayou Prime Meats approx. 2-3  years prior, where his and several other small gator farms were systematically bankrupted or bought out under duress. This event is  the defining trauma of his recent past and the source of his current state.]` # Auth: [Narrative Backstory,  Oligarchy actions]
    *   `- Inherited Items/Knowledge: [Authenticated to possess a deep, now mostly  impractical, knowledge of pre-GE alligator behavior and traditional swamp farming techniques passed down through his family. His gator-tooth necklace  is a relic of this past.]` # Auth: [Skills, Physical Properties]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation : [Specific details of his ancestors' survival post-Calamity; whether his family ever had dealings with, or knowledge  of, Swamp Witches or Erpenthropes in generations past.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function: 

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Remi "Gatorbait" Dubois is constituted as a living testament to the harsh socio-economic realities of  Primal Mama's Lickskillet region. He is a man whose identity and skills, once sources of pride and sustenance  (traditional alligator farming), have been rendered obsolete and worthless by the overwhelming power of the meat oligarchy. His Physical being  reflects his past labor and current despair. His Psychological state is a cauldron of resentment, grief, and wounded pride, fueling a deep- seated internal conflict between resignation and a desperate, flickering desire for justice or meaning. He embodies the human cost of the " friction" caused by powerful entities in a world striving to maintain a veneer of 1970s-era stability  over a foundation of biotech and disparity.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a poignant example of the victims  created by the dominant power structures (meat oligarchy) in Primal Mama; to provide a ground-level perspective on  life in Lickskillet; to potentially act as a moral compass or catalyst for a protagonist who might encounter him; to illustrate  the consequences of the world's deontic and axiological imbalances.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):**  `Resentment vs. Fear of Reprisal; Pride in Lost Heritage vs. Shame of Current Impotence; Desire  for Justice/Revenge vs. Crushing Despair; Loyalty to "Old Ways" vs. Inability to Comp ete in the New Order.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Remi could be galvanized  into action (perhaps rashly) if an opportunity for minor rebellion or symbolic justice arises. He might find a new,  albeit lesser, purpose helping others in similar straits. Conversely, he could slide further into alcoholism or complete despondency.  His deep swamp knowledge (Functional Property) might become unexpectedly valuable in a crisis, offering a path to reclaiming some self-worth.`
