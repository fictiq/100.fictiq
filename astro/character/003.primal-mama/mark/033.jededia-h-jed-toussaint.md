# Story World Codex: Fictional Person Constitution Protocol
# Based on Doležel's Heter ocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

**World:** Primal Mama
**Codex Version :** 0.2 - Character Constitution (Jedediah Toussaint)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle  of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character' s being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Human male, mid -40s, with pronounced African facial features – broad nose, full lips. Once powerfully built from swamp work, now gaunt  and perpetually hunched, radiating weariness.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific  Features: [Deep-set, haunted dark eyes that rarely meet another's gaze directly. Skin is a rich brown , but ashen around the mouth and eyes from stress and malnutrition. Hair is short, tightly coiled, and prematurely fle cked with grey, often matted with swamp detritus.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Appearance _Distinctive Marks: [The thumb and first two fingers of his left hand are missing, replaced by ragged scar tissue –  a stark reminder of an "enforcement action" by oligarchy thugs or a desperate escape. A faded, intricate geometric  tattoo, reminiscent of West African motifs, is partially visible on his right forearm when his sleeve is pushed up.]` #  Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Filthy, torn canvas trousers, once  dyed a deep indigo, now faded to murky brown. A threadbare, patched-up burlap shirt. Often barefoot, or  with remnants of hide-wrapped foot coverings. Constantly shivers, even in the bayou heat.]` # Auth: [ This Codex - Visual Interpretation of Primal Mama aesthetic for the downtrodden]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [ Voice is low, hoarse, and often breaks into a coughing fit. Speaks in short, hesitant phrases, sometimes mum bling incoherently. Carries a distinct Lickskillet drawl, but fear has clipped his expressiveness.]` #  Auth: [This Codex - Reflecting Primal Mama's regionalism and his trauma]
    *   `- Gait /Mannerisms: [Moves with a furtive, skittish gait, always scanning his surroundings for threats. F linches at loud noises or sudden movements. Constantly wrings his remaining right hand or touches the stump of his left .]` # Auth: [This Codex - Embodiment of fear and trauma]
    *   `- Associated Scent ( If Any): [Overpowering scent of stale swamp water, mud, unwashed body, and a faint, lingering  metallic tang of old blood or fear-sweat.]` # Auth: [This Codex - Sensory Palette of Primal Mama' s underbelly]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/weight (though visibly underweight ), specific details of his original, pre-trauma physique, full extent of minor scars from swamp life.]`

 **2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot * do.*
    *   `- Skill (Past): [Formerly an adept alligator trapper and skiff navigator, with  a good working knowledge of bayou flora/fauna. Capable of basic butchery and hide preparation.]` # Auth:  [Backstory Implication - Lickskillet resident]
    *   `- Skill (Present): [Proficient at hiding,  scavenging for scraps, and moving silently through dense swamp terrain. Possesses a desperate, animal cunning for short-term survival.] ` # Auth: [Current State as Fugitive]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Severely weakened by malnutrition  and sustained stress. Missing fingers on left hand significantly impair manual dexterity for tasks requiring two good hands (e.g., complex tool  use, fighting). Prone to sickness from exposure and poor diet.]` # Auth: [Physical Description, World Real ities]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Largely ignorant of Beetriot politics or the true extent of the meat  oligarchy's power structure, only knowing its brutal local enforcers. His understanding of the "biological calamity" is  based on Lickskillet folklore and hearsay. No knowledge of advanced GE or solar tech beyond seeing it operate.]` # Auth : [Social Position, Epistemic Rules of Primal Mama]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Com pletely ostracized. Branded a criminal (likely related to a trumped-up charge involving cattle or defying the  oligarchy). Has no allies, no resources, and no legal standing. Actively hunted by local enforcers or bounty  hunters sympathetic to the meat processors.]` # Auth: [Victim Status, Deontic Rules of Primal Mama ]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Specific fighting skills (likely minimal beyond desperate flailing);  ability to read or write; knowledge of specific ritual magic (unlikely for his profile).]`

**3. Psychological Properties ( Authenticated Interiority):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's textually constituted inner life.*
    *   `-  Core Trait: [Overwhelming Fear / Paranoia]` # Auth: [Mannerisms, Current State]
    *    `- Core Trait: [Deep-seated Grief / Loss (for his former life, possibly family)]` # Auth:  [Haunted Appearance, Implied Backstory]
    *   `- Core Trait (Vestigial): [ A flicker of stubborn Pride / Dignity (buried deep beneath trauma, might emerge in extreme moments)]` # Auth: [Potential  for character arc]
    *   `- Dominant Emotion: [Abject Terror / Despair, punctuated by moments of dull  apathy.]` # Auth: [Actions, Descriptions]
    *   `- Key Motivator (Current): [Moment -to-moment Survival; Evading capture; A desperate, almost extinguished hope of clearing his name or understanding *why* this  happened.]` # Auth: [Fugitive Status]
    *   `- Key Belief: [Believes the world is  fundamentally unjust and predatory. May have bought into the "invisible women" conspiracy as an explanation for his inexplicable ruin, or  blames the meat oligarchy directly but feels utterly powerless.]` # Auth: [Epistemic rules of Primal Mama , psychological response to trauma]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [The instinct to survive vs. the crushing weight  of despair that makes him want to give up; The memory of who he was vs. the broken creature he has become.] ` # Auth: [Logical consequence of his situation]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Haunted by vivid,  recurring memories of his life before the event that destroyed it – the smell of his cook-fire, the sounds of his family ( if he had one), the feel of a successful hunt. The traumatic event itself is a jumble of terror, pain, and confusion , possibly with faces of local enforcers (e.g., "Opossum John's crew") leering at him . No memory of actually committing the crime he was accused of.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `#  Psychological Undersaturation: [Specific details of his family (if any, allows flexibility for narrative); his views on the  deified celebrities (likely irrelevant to his current struggle); precise nature of his original personality beyond "hard-working swamp dweller."]` 

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's  place within the world's networks.*
    *   `- Official Role (Former): [Independent Alligator Harvester/Processor  (Small-scale, 'mom-and-pop' Lickskillet operation).]` # Auth: [Backstory] 
    *   `- Official Role (Current): [Designated Criminal / Fugitive by local Lickskillet ' authorities' (likely corrupt constables in the pocket of the meat oligarchy).]` # Auth: [Deontic  rules application]
    *   `- Social Status: [Outcast / Pariah. Lowest possible rung in Lickskillet society . His name is likely used as a bogeyman to scare others into compliance.]` # Auth: [Consequence of Acc usation]
    *   `- Primary Affiliation: [None. Formerly a member of the Lickskillet community.] ` # Auth: [Current State]
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: [None. Actively avoids all contact .]` # Auth: [Fugitive Behavior]
    *   `- Key Relationship 1 (Lost): [Family  – Wife and child (e.g., named Ama and Little Jed) – likely scattered, taken, or killed during/ after his framing to further crush him or as 'collateral damage'. Their memory is a source of immense pain and guilt .]` # Auth: [This Codex - Victimization Intensifier]
    *   `- Key Relationship 2 ( Antagonistic): [Local Meat Oligarchy Enforcers (e.g., a figure like 'Opossum John ', known for brutality and loyalty to a specific processing plant owner). He recognizes them and they are actively hunting him.]`  # Auth: [Primal Mama world structure, Deontic rules]
    *   `- Species/Type: [Human  (Baseline Primal Mama Strain)]` # Auth: [Default]
    *   `# Social Undersaturation:  [Specific friends he had before his fall; any distant relatives; precise details of his interactions with Swamp Witches or Er penthropes (likely avoids all supernaturals out of general fear).]`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional  Status):**
   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
    *   `- Property ID: MOD AL-JED-NONE`
        *   *Property:* `None. Jedediah Toussaint operates entirely  under the established alethic, deontic, axiological, and epistemic rules of Primal Mama for ordinary humans .`
        *   *Description:* `His victimhood is a direct result of the application of these common world rules and  power structures, not any unique personal modality.`
        *   *Limits:* `N/A`
        *   * Authentication:* `Primal Mama Coherence Protocol (by default for non-exceptional individuals).`
    *   ` # Note: His ordinariness in this regard makes his suffering under the world's unique rules more poignant and illustrative.` 

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the character' s value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet General Populace): [Authenticated  as viewed with 'fear', 'pity (from a safe distance)', 'a cautionary tale'. His story is whispered to  discourage defiance against the meat processors. Some may secretly believe his innocence but are too terrified to offer aid.]` # Auth: [Logical  social consequence in Primal Mama]
    *   `- Reputation (Meat Oligarchy & Enforcers): [Authenticated as 'dangerous  nuisance', 'escaped criminal', 'property violator' (if accused of poaching or cattle-related crimes). His  capture might carry a small bounty. He is considered disposable.]` # Auth: [Oligarchy's perspective] 
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via his internal state and backstory as an 'innocent man  wronged', a 'victim of systemic injustice'. His current desperate actions are framed by survival needs, not malice.]` # Auth : [This Codex – establishing his victimhood for narrative purposes]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [How  Beetriot citizens would view him (likely not at all, too insignificant); perception by Erpenthropes or Swamp W itches (if they were ever to encounter him, likely indifference unless he trespassed).]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated  Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.*
    *   `-  Origin: [Authenticated as born and raised in the Lickskillet region, from a family with several generations of swamp dwellers . His lineage carries no special status or wealth.]` # Auth: [This Codex - Grounding him in the setting]
     *   `- Key Past Event Connection (Personal): [The "Incident" – Authenticated as being falsely accused and brutally  punished for either: a) possession/intent to distribute cattle meat (a convenient frame-up by the oligarchy to  seize his productive trapping grounds or eliminate a mildly outspoken small competitor), OR b) sabotage against a major meat processing plant ( another frame-up). This event involved the loss of his fingers, his business, his home, and likely his family.]`  # Auth: [This Codex - Core of his victimhood, tied to Primal Mama's deontic/al ethic rules]
    *   `- Inherited Items: [None remain. Everything was confiscated or destroyed. He  might carry a single, small, hidden memento from his past life – perhaps a smooth river stone his child gave him, or  a tattered piece of his wife's shawl – that he guards fiercely.]` # Auth: [This Codex -  Symbol of his loss]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Specific details of his ancestors; precise timeline  of his life pre-Incident beyond generalities; the exact names and fates of all his family members beyond 'lost'. ]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Jedediah Toussaint is  constituted as a living embodiment of the brutal consequences of Primal Mama's socio-economic and legal order, particularly the  oppressive power of the meat oligarchy and the absolute terror of the cattle consumption taboo. His Physical deterioration, Functional incapacitation, and Psychological  brokenness are direct results of his unjust victimization. He is a man stripped of his Social standing, his History (in  terms of a future), and any positive Axiological value within his community, now existing purely in a state of reactive survival.  His African features and deep swamp roots ground him authentically within the diverse tapestry of Primal Mama's Lickskillet,  making his tragedy more specific and impactful.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a stark illustration of the stakes  and injustices within Primal Mama; to act as a catalyst or object of pity/concern for a protagonist; to highlight  the cruelty of the meat oligarchy and the pervasive fear that underpins Lickskillet society. He can represent the " forgotten victims" of the established order. His potential belief in conspiracies like the "invisible women" could also showcase how  ordinary people try to make sense of systemic oppression they cannot otherwise explain.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle): ** `The primal urge to survive vs. soul-crushing despair; Fading memories of love and dignity vs. the brutal izing reality of his present; A desperate, suppressed desire for justice/explanation vs. overwhelming, paralyzing fear.`
*   ** Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `While deeply traumatized, potential exists for: a flicker of defiance if  pushed to an absolute limit; finding an unexpected, hidden ally; sharing his story (if he can overcome his fear)  to expose injustice; succumbing entirely to madness or despair; or finding a small, tragic moment of peace or self-sacrifice. His  development is less about regaining what was lost (which seems impossible) and more about how he faces his brokenness.`
