## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of ** Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex,  core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters  by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness,  coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world' s rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle .*

*   **Core Essence:** `Jedediah Honeycutt is constituted as a man of integrity and skill  being systematically crushed by the impersonal economic machinery of Primal Mama's meat oligarchy. His Physical weariness, Functional  limitations (lack of capital/modern tools), and Psychological burden (grief, worry for his daughter, indignation) are direct  results of his Social position as a small Lickskillet processor. He embodies the human cost of the world's core  Deontic rule (oligarchy power) and Axiological tension (value of tradition/small business vs. ruthless " progress"). His very existence is a testament to the "friction" mentioned in the world's governing laws.`
*   ** Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a primary victim character, illustrating the harsh realities of life in Lickskillet  under the shadow of the meat oligarchy. He humanizes the socio-economic conflict, providing an emotional anchor for themes  of injustice, resilience, and the potential for desperation. He can act as a motivator or a cautionary tale for other characters.` 
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Hope for his daughter's future vs. the crushing  weight of despair; Maintaining pride and traditional methods vs. the desperate need for any advantage to survive; Grief for his lost wife  and business vs. the responsibility to keep going; Desire for justice vs. the pragmatic understanding of his powerlessness.`
*    **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be pushed to make a desperate, morally compromising choice (e. g., dealing with shady elements, attempting to use forbidden/stigmatized tech for a quick buck, a desperate act against  the oligarchy). Could become a reluctant symbol for other downtrodden Lickskillet residents. Could find an unexpected,  unconventional ally (perhaps an Erpenthrope with a strange sense of justice, or someone from Beetriot with a conscience ). His storyline could explore the limits of endurance or the spark of rebellion in the oppressed.`
