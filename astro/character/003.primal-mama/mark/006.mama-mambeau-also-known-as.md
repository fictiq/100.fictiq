# Based on Doležel's Heter ocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides  the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following  Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the  **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [e.g ., Low, raspy, heavily accented with a unique bayou patois; often speaks in riddles, chants, or pron ouncements that blend folk wisdom with unsettling otherworldly insights. Her laugh is a dry cackle.]` # Auth: [Impl ied by archetype and setting]

This knowledge is esoteric and not replicable through conventional Primal Mama technology.]`
         *   *Limits:* `[Magic is geographically bound to areas with strong swamp influence; requires specific, often rare or  unsettling, components and rituals; is mentally and physically taxing; outcomes can be unpredictable or carry unforeseen costs.

    *    `- Reputation (Beetriot Elite/Meat Oligarchy): [e.g., Authenticated primarily as a dangerous myth , a piece of "ignorant swamp superstition," or at best, a troublesome eccentric best avoided. May be vaguely linked  to the "Invisible Women" conspiracy by some paranoid urbanites.]` # Auth: [Contrast between urban/rural,  tech/magic]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [e.g., Authenticated as operating  on a deeply alien or "primal" morality, inscrutable and often disturbing by conventional human standards. Serves the swamp' s "balance," which can appear cruel or benevolent depending on perspective. (Chaotic Neutral / True Neutral from a human -centric view)]` # Auth: [Cthulhu-goth influence]

    *   `- Origin: [e.g., Authenticated  as belonging to a lineage of Swamp Witches stretching back generations, possibly pre-dating the Biological Calamity. Her knowledge  is ancestral and passed down through direct experience and ritual.]` # Auth: [Logical for deep esoteric knowledge]
     *   `- Key Past Event Connection (Subjective): [e.g., Possesses lore and ritual practices that survived  (and perhaps were shaped by) the Biological Calamity. Views the Calamity not as an end, but as a transformation  the swamp absorbed and adapted to.]` # Auth: [Perspective on world-changing event]
    *   `- Inher ited Items:** [e.g., Authenticated to possess ancient, hand-scribed grimoires bound in gator hide and human  skin; a collection of bizarre ritual tools crafted from bone, swamp-forged iron, and unknown substances; her shack  is built upon the remnants of older, similar dwellings.]` # Auth: [Tangible links to her lineage]
    *    `# Historical Undersaturation: [e.g., Specific names or deeds of her ancestors; her personal experiences  during the height of the Calamity; precise origins of Vampire Bunny creation.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle .*

*   **Core Essence:** `Mama Mambeau is constituted as an embodiment of the Primal Mama swamp's  ancient, amoral, and mystical undercurrents. She is a living repository of Cthulhu-goth-Southern  esoteric knowledge, existing outside and often in defiance of Beetriot's retro-futuristic order and the deified celebrity cult s. Her power is derived from the swamp itself, making her intrinsically tied to its health and its secrets. She represents  the untamable, the primal, and the weird spiritual miasma that permeates the world, a direct counterpoint to the  engineered and propagandized aspects of Primal Mama society.]`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `[e.g., Oracle /Source of forbidden knowledge; Gatekeeper to deeper swamp mysteries; Potential uneasy ally or formidable obstacle; Embodiment of the  world's "Cthulhu-goth-Southern" spiritual dimension; Catalyst for characters confronting the unnatural or  seeking solutions beyond conventional means; Possible antagonist if her "balance" conflicts with protagonists' goals.]`
*   ** Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `[e.g., The burden of ancient, often terrifying, knowledge vs . the encroachment of the "new" world; Her deep connection to the amoral swamp vs. residual human empathy ( if any); The need for isolation to maintain her power vs. the occasional necessity of interacting with the very people she distrust s.]`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `[e.g., Revealing critical , hidden lore about the Biological Calamity or the true nature of Erpenthropes; Being forced into an  alliance against a common threat to the swamp; Her powers waning or growing in response to world events; Confronting a novel  magical or technological threat that challenges her ancient ways.]`
