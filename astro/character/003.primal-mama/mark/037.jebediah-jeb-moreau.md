## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Text ually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the  heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character 's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Middle-aged male with African features, perhaps  early 50s, skin weathered by years of swamp sun and labor. Lean but strong frame, showing signs of  recent stress and fatigue.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Deep- set, kind eyes that currently hold a persistent shadow of worry. Lines etched around his mouth and brow from both laughter in  better times and recent hardship. Broad nose.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive  Marks: [A long, faded scar along his left forearm from an old gator bite – a mark once worn with pride, now  a reminder of a more independent past. Calloused, capable hands.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *    `- Typical Attire: [Worn, patched denim overalls over a faded, sweat-stained chambray work shirt.  Heavy-duty, mud-caked rubber boots. Occasionally a battered, wide-brimmed straw hat against the sun . Clothing is clean but perpetually looks 'lived-in,' consistent with 1970s practical workwear aesthetic .]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Aesthetic Guidelines]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [ Warm, resonant baritone with a distinct Lickskillet bayou drawl. Speech is usually measured and thoughtful, but can become  strained or clipped when discussing his troubles. Prone to sighs of resignation.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
     *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Slightly stooped posture from years of physical work and current  burdens. Moves with a practiced economy of motion typical of a lifelong laborer. Wrings his hands or rubs the back of his neck  when anxious or discussing Oligarchy pressures.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If  Any): [Faint lingering scent of swamp water, alligator musk, and perhaps cheap, sweet pipe tobacco (a small , increasingly unaffordable comfort).]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation:  [Exact height and weight, specific brand of pipe tobacco, hairstyle (likely short, practical).]`

**2. Functional  Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot*  do.*
    *   `- Skill: [Expert Alligator Trapping (Wild Catch – traditional methods passed down through generations in  Lickskillet)]` # Auth: [Backstory Implication, Community Role]
    *   `- Skill:  [Proficient Alligator Butchering & Basic Processing (Mom-and-pop scale, using older, well-maintained  1970s-style equipment)]` # Auth: [His Livelihood]
    *    `- Skill: [Operation and field repair of aging airboats and other swamp-based transport/tools (constrained by 19 70s tech aesthetic)]` # Auth: [Necessity of his environment/profession]
    *   `- Skill : [Knowledge of local swamp ecosystems, gator behavior, and safe navigation routes (pre-Saurian Sanctuary mass  farming era knowledge)]` # Auth: [Generational Knowledge]
    *   `- Limitation (Economic): [Severe financial  hardship due to predatory pricing, restricted market access, and subtle sabotage by the Meat Processor Oligarchy. Likely in debt.] ` # Auth: [Primal Mama Deontic/Axiological notes on "friction"]
    *   `- Limitation  (Technological): [Cannot afford or access advanced GE alligator strains or sophisticated solar-power systems for his own operations;  reliant on wild catch or less efficient, 'natural' gator stock which puts him at a disadvantage.]` # Auth:  [Primal Mama Alethic Modalities on GE Gators & Solar Dominance]
    *   `- Limitation (Influence ): [Possesses no significant leverage or political capital to challenge the Oligarchy's practices. Local Lickskillet officials  may be sympathetic but are powerless or bought-off.]` # Auth: [Implied Power Dynamics of Primal Mama] 
    *   `- Limitation (Legal): [Operates within a tightening net of regulations subtly designed by the Oligarchy  to favor large-scale, GE-focused operations over traditional ones.]` # Auth: [Extrapolation from "friction "]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Firearms proficiency (likely owns a gun as per regional  norms, but not a primary skill), specific knowledge of advanced GE processes (he wouldn't have it).]`

 **3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's textually constituted  inner life.*
    *   `- Core Trait: [Resilient / Stoic (Culturally ingrained response to hardship in  Lickskillet)]` # Auth: [Implied from enduring his situation]
    *   `- Core Tra it: [Deeply Principled / Fair-minded (Finds the Oligarchy's tactics inherently unjust)]` #  Auth: [Basis for his victimhood being felt as injustice]
    *   `- Core Trait: [Proud  (Of his heritage, his skills, his former independence, making his current situation more galling)]` # Auth: [Reaction  to loss of autonomy]
    *   `- Dominant Emotion: [Weariness / Suppressed Anger / Growing Des pair (A result of the relentless pressure)]` # Auth: [Consequence of victimization]

    *    `- Key Belief: [Belief in an honest day's work for an honest day's pay (a value system being  eroded by the Oligarchy). Believes the "old ways" had value.]` # Auth: [Contrast with Olig archy]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [Desire to resist the Oligarchy vs. Fear of severe repercussions for his family  and himself; Pride in his traditional methods vs. The crushing "efficiency" of GE gator operations he can't compete with ; Hope for a turnaround vs. The encroaching reality of failure.]` # Auth: [Natural conflicts for his situation]
     *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Clear, perhaps bittersweet, memories of a time when independent gator men in  Lickskillet thrived; Specific instances of Oligarchy agents manipulating prices, 'losing' shipments, or imposing impossible  new 'standards'.]` # Auth: [Personal history of victimization]
    *   `# Psychological Undersaturation:  [Specific views on deified celebrities (likely a quiet, traditional reverence without deep theological engagement), detailed opinions on Beetriot ( seen as distant, powerful, and disconnected from swamp reality), stance on "invisible women" conspiracy (might be a background  hum of accepted local paranoia but not his primary concern).]`

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated  Position):**

    *   `- Key Relationship 1: [To his family (e.g., Spouse : Elodie Moreau, a pragmatic and supportive but worried partner. Child: Young Thomas, whose future Jeb frets over ). Provides emotional core and stakes.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Key Relationship 2 : [To local Oligarchy contact/enforcer (e.g., "Mr. Shanklin" – a cold , officious Beetriot man who handles Lickskillet accounts): Antagonistic, source of immense pressure and unfair  demands.]` # Auth: [The Face of his Victimization]
    *   `- Key Relationship 3: [ To other struggling Lickskillet old-timers/processors: Bonds of shared hardship, quiet commiseration, perhaps  futile attempts at collective bargaining.]` # Auth: [Shared Experience]

    *   `# Social Undersaturation:  [Specific friends outside his professional circle, precise relationship with local law enforcement (likely sympathetic but ineffective), any ties to Swamp  Witches (probably avoids them as bad luck/dangerous).]`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
    *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
    *   `[None Authenticated. Jeb operates  entirely within the standard physical, biological, and societal rules of Primal Mama. His victimhood stems from the application of these rules by  more powerful entities, not from any unique property of his own.]`

    *    `- Reputation (Meat Processor Oligarchy): [Authenticated as 'marginal,' 'inefficient,' 'expendable,' 'a  relic of the past,' 'easily squeezed out or bought cheap.']` # Auth: [Implied by Oligarchy's actions /goals]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via narrative focus as a fundamentally decent , sympathetic individual being unjustly crushed by an amoral or immoral system/entity (the Oligarchy).]` # Auth:  [Thematic purpose of his character]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [Reputation among  Erpenthropes (likely unknown to them), Beetriot elite (irrelevant to them).]`

**7. Historical  Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.* 
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as born and raised in Lickskillet. His family has been working  the swamps and dealing in alligators for at least three generations, predating the Biological Calamity and the subsequent rise  of GE Alligators.]` # Auth: [Provides depth and connection to pre-GE era]
    *   `- Key  Past Event Connection: [Actively experienced the economic shift in Lickskillet from a decentralized network of independent trappers/ processors to a system dominated by the Meat Processor Oligarchy and their GE alligator products. Remembers the "good old days" before  the squeeze.]` # Auth: [Living history of the conflict]
    *   `- Inherited Items/B urdens: [Authenticated to possess his grandfather's rusted but still sharp skinning knife (symbol of heritage), the  family's small, heavily mortgaged swamp-side processing shed with its aging 1970s-style  equipment, and a deep-seated knowledge of traditional swamp ways now devalued.]` # Auth: [Tangible links  to past and current struggles]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Specific details of his ancestors' lives , direct personal experiences during the Biological Calamity itself (he would have been younger, it would have shaped his world  but not necessarily involved him directly in its core events).]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Jebediah Moreau is constituted as a man of integrity and traditional skill, deeply connected to the Pr imal Mama swamp heritage, who is being systematically victimized and economically strangled by the impersonal, technologically advantaged, and morally  flexible Meat Processor Oligarchy. His Physical weathering reflects his Functional and Psychological burdens. His Social standing is strong locally but nonexistent  where it matters for power. He embodies the struggle of the 'little man' against a modernizing, retro-futuristic capitalist  force within the unique constraints and aesthetics of Primal Mama.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as  a primary example and human face of the socio-economic oppression exerted by the Meat Processor Oligarchy in Lickskillet . To provide a relatable, sympathetic character through whose eyes the audience can understand the harsh realities for 'mom-and-pop ' operations. His plight can be a catalyst for other characters' actions (e.g., investigation, rebellion, pity ) or a tragic illustration of the world's harshness.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):**  `The fight to maintain dignity and provide for family vs. the overwhelming economic and social pressure from the Oligarchy. Loyalty  to traditional, sustainable methods vs. the imposed "efficiency" of the new GE-dominated market. The urge to resist  injustice vs. the pragmatic fear of retaliation and complete ruin.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** ` Jeb could be pushed to a breaking point: either succumbing to despair and losing everything (tragic outcome), making  a desperate and dangerous choice (e.g., dealing with shady elements, attempting sabotage, seeking help from unconventional sources like Swamp W itches or even Erpenthropes if truly desperate), or becoming a figurehead for a localized, likely doomed, resistance.  He could also find an unexpected ally or a small, temporary reprieve that offers a glimmer of hope.`
