# Based on Doležel's Heter ocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings)  within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

    *   `- Typical Attire: [Profession ally tailored but durable clothing that adheres to the late 1970s aesthetic: muted earth-tone pantsuits with slightly  flared legs, practical blouses with wide collars, sturdy low-heeled boots suitable for navigating uneven terrain or boat decks. Always carries  a well-organized, leather-and-canvas satchel with brass fittings.]` # Auth: [Coherence - Tech  Aesthetic Constraint; Implied Practicality for Role]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Modulated, clear  contralto. Speaks articulately, choosing words with care. Can adopt a more formal tone for official Beetriot business,  or a slightly more relaxed, though still professional, cadence when dealing with Lickskillet locals or Swamp Dwellers.]`  # Auth: [Dialogue Snippets - Evie_Dialogue_Reel_01]
    *   `- Gait/M annerisms: [Purposeful and measured. Has a habit of subtly observing her surroundings and the body language of others.  When listening intently, she might tap a finger against her chin. Avoids ostentatious gestures.]` # Auth: [Action  Descriptions - Evie_Scenes_01-03]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [ Faint scent of pressed linens (from Beetriot standards), often overlaid with the ambient smells of her current environment – e .g., damp earth and ozone near swamps, or processed alligator and solvent in Lickskillet.]` # Auth : [Sensory Palette - Primal Mama]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Ambassador Evelyn "Evie" Dubois is constituted as a bridge-builder in the fractured,  retro-futuristic, bayou-infused world of Primal Mama. Her being is defined by the tension between her Beet riot origins/loyalties and her empathetic drive to understand and conciliate with the disparate, often hostile, cultures outside  the city. Functionally, she is a skilled negotiator constrained by the 1970s technological aesthetic and the  deep-seated social stigmas (e.g., Automaton use) of her world. Psychologically, her pragmatic idealism  is constantly tested by the pervasive paranoia (e.g., "invisible women" conspiracy), entrenched power structures (meat oligarchy), and  the unsettling supernatural realities (Swamp Witches, Erpenthropes, ghosts) of Primal Mama. She  embodies the struggle for reasoned communication and cooperation in a world steeped in bizarre traditions (cattle artifacts, celebrity deities) and raw  survival instincts.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `Can serve as a POV character allowing exploration of Primal Mama's  diverse factions and their conflicts. Alternatively, a key NPC who facilitates or complicates the protagonist's interactions with these factions.  Her missions can drive plots related to resource disputes, cultural misunderstandings, political intrigue between Beetriot and Lickskillet,  or attempts to mediate with the more enigmatic swamp communities.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Be etriot Duty vs. Lickskillet/Swamp Empathy; Idealistic Desire for Cooperation vs. Pragmatic Acceptance  of Harsh Realities; Respect for Tradition (including 1970s aesthetic, celebrity gods) vs. Fr ustration with Irrationality/Inefficiency; Official Knowledge/Narratives vs. Whispers of Deeper, More  Disturbing Truths.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Deepening understanding and trust  (or escalating conflict) with Lickskillet or Swamp factions (Social/Relational change). Uncovering unsettling truths about the Cal amity or the nature of power in Primal Mama (Epistemic/Psychological change). Being forced to make increasingly  difficult moral compromises (Axiological/Psychological shift). Acquiring unique knowledge or even a grudging magical boon from a Swamp  Witch (Functional/Epistemic change if narrative supports it without breaking her baseline human status).`
