# Story World Codex: Fictional Person Constitution Protocol
# Based on Doležel's Heter ocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

**World:** Primal Mama
**Codex Version :** 0.1 - Character Constitution

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm . Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by  the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition** .*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose  complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the  specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties ( Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_ General: [Human male, Erpenthrope. Appears perpetually late 50s, though actual age is far  greater. Wiry and weathered, skin like tanned alligator hide from sun and swamp. Surprisingly agile.]` # Auth:  [PMCILP - Erpenthrope properties; This Codex]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features:  [Deep-set, piercing blue eyes that seem to see more than is there. Long, greying hair and beard, often braided  with small, carved alligator teeth or polished river stones. A prominent, jagged scar bisects his left eyebrow, a m emento from a close encounter in his beast form decades ago.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Appearance _Distinctive Marks: [Faint, scale-like patterning visible on his forearms and neck in certain light –  a subtle tell of his Erpenthrope nature even in human form. A faded, hand-poked tattoo of a  stylized Bandit Trans Am on his right bicep.]` # Auth: [This Codex; PMCILP - Erpenthrope  traits]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Worn, patched-together denim overalls (often with one  strap undone) over a faded t-shirt depicting a celestial alligator. Barefoot or in simple, handmade alligator-skin moc casins. Carries a satchel made of woven reeds and synthetic 1970s-era orange vinyl, containing  his "sacred texts."]` # Auth: [This Codex; PMCILP - 1970s Aesthetic ]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Slow, deliberate Southern drawl, surprisingly gentle but capable of booming  pronouncements. Often peppers speech with misremembered or reinterpreted quotes from Burt Reynolds films, Jerry Reed songs, or  Gram Parsons' lyrics, treating them as gospel.]` # Auth: [This Codex; PMCILP - Deified Celebrities ]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Moves with a quiet, almost reptilian grace. Often  seen staring intently at the sun, a water reflection, or the intricate patterns of a cypress knee, as if seeking an  omen. Has a habit of humming Gram Parsons tunes almost unconsciously.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *    `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Swamp mud, sun-baked reeds, old paper, and a  faint, almost metallic tang when his Erpenthropic nature is close to the surface.]` # Auth: [This Codex] 
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/weight, specific details of his Alligator Beast  Man form beyond "formidable," full inventory of minor personal effects.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations ):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*
    *    `- Skill: [Erpenthrope Transformation (into formidable Alligator Beast Man)]` # Auth: [PMCIL P - Erpenthrope Modality]
    *   `- Skill: [Swamp Survival & Navigation (Expert;  can live off the land indefinitely)]` # Auth: [Narrative Implication of Lifestyle]
    *   `- Skill:  [Oratory & "Theological" Interpretation (Can hold listeners rapt with his unique interpretations of the Deified Trio's " works")]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Skill: [Rudimentary Ritual Magic (Lear ned fragments for ghost perception, primarily to seek insights from "ancestors" or those who might have "known" the deities)] ` # Auth: [PMCILP - Spectral Interaction; This Codex]
    *   `- Ability (Unique): [ Near-Immortality (Erpenthrope trait; has witnessed vast swathes of post-calamity history )]` # Auth: [PMCILP - Erpenthrope Modality]
    *   `- Ability ( Unique): [Enhanced Solar Energy Absorption (A minor aspect of his Erpenthrope nature, less efficient than GE All igators but allows for surprising endurance under the sun)]` # Auth: [This Codex, logical extension of solar dominance]
    *    `- Limitation (Physical): [Transformation takes a toll, requiring rest/solar absorption after. Vulnerable to specific, esoteric  wards or artifacts designed to repel/harm Erpenthropes (if such exist).]` # Auth: [This  Codex, narrative balance]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [His "theology" is highly idiosyncratic and based  on fragmented, often corrupted pre-calamity media (e.g., worn VHS tapes, garbled audio recordings ). Lacks formal technical knowledge beyond basic swamp mechanics.]` # Auth: [This Codex; PMCILP - Ep istemic Fragmentation]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Often dismissed as a madman or eccentric by urban ites or those heavily invested in mainstream interpretations of the Deities. Can be unsettling to "normal" folk.]` # Auth : [This Codex]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Proficiency with firearms (likely dis dains them as "unspiritual noise"); ability to operate complex 1970s tech beyond a simple solar  skiff motor.]`

**3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**
   *Purpose: Define the character' s textually constituted inner life.*
    *   `- Core Trait: [Sincere Faith (in his unique  interpretation of the Deified Trio)]` # Auth: [Actions, Dialogue]
    *   `- Core Trait:  [Truth-Seeker (Erpenthrope nature drives him to find the *essence* behind the "divine  masks")]` # Auth: [PMCILP - Erpenthrope traits; This Codex]
    *    `- Core Trait: [Patient Perseverance (Decades, if not centuries, spent on his quest)]` # Auth: [Narr ative Implication of Immortality & Quest]
    *   `- Dominant Emotion: [A profound, often melancholic A we, mixed with an unshakeable, quiet Hope.]` # Auth: [This Codex, demeanor]
    *    `- Key Motivator: [To achieve true "Communion" with the divine essence of Reynolds, Reed, and  Parsons; to understand *why* they were chosen or chose themselves as conduits of "Primal Mama's Grace."]  ` # Auth: [Explicit Character Goal]
    *   `- Key Belief: [The Deified Trio are not just  icons but facets of a greater, perhaps even impersonal, spiritual force that speaks through them. Believes "Primal Mama"  (the spirit of the world/swamp) chose them.]` # Auth: [His Oratory/Theology]
     *   `- Key Belief: [The 1970s aesthetic is not mere style, but a divinely inspired  "Golden Age" framework whose true spiritual significance is yet to be fully understood.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *    `- Internal Conflict: [The Erpenthrope's drive for tangible truth vs. the necessity of faith.  The often crude or contradictory "scriptures" (film plots, song lyrics) vs. the profound spiritual guidance he derives  from them. Loneliness of his unique, long-lived perspective.]` # Auth: [This Codex, character depth ]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Vivid, fragmented memories stretching back centuries; remembers the "Time  of Smoke" (the calamity) and the "Silent Years" before the Gator Renaissance. Remembers when "Burt was  just Burt," making his deification all the more profound to him.]` # Auth: [This Codex, leveraging near -immortality]
    *   `# Psychological Undersaturation: [Specific details of his pre-quest  life; opinions on the "invisible women" conspiracy (likely sees it as a distraction from true spiritual matters); full emotional  range beyond his dominant states.]`

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's place within the world's networks.*
    *   `- Official Role : [None. Self-appointed "Voice in the Wilderness."] ` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `-  Social Status: [Outsider Mystic. Regarded with a mix of fear, reverence, amusement, or pity depending  on the community/individual. Holds a certain "spiritual authority" among some isolated swamp dwellers.]` # Auth: [ This Codex]
    *   `- Primary Affiliation: [Devoted to the "Triune Divinity" of Reynolds , Reed, and Parsons, and the "Spirit of Primal Mama." Loosely connected to other Erpenthropes if  encountered, sharing ancient lore but not necessarily dogma.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Key  Relationship 1: [To the Deified Trio (as objects of worship/study): An intensely personal, one-sided  spiritual relationship.]` # Auth: [Character Motivation]
    *   `- Key Relationship 2: [To " The Skeptic" (e.g., a pragmatic alligator farmer or a Beetriot official): Recurring foil who challenges his beliefs , forcing him to articulate his faith.]` # Auth: [Potential Narrative Device]
    *   `- Key Relationship  3: [To a potential "Disciple" (e.g., a young, disillusioned individual seeking meaning):  Someone who might see sincerity in his madness.]` # Auth: [Potential Narrative Device]
    *   `- Species/ Type: [Erpenthrope (American Alligator Beast Man variant)]` # Auth: [PMCILP] 
    *   `# Social Undersaturation: [Specific family ties (likely long gone or irrelevant); precise relationships  with any specific Swamp Witch covens (might see them as practitioners of a "different, darker branch" of Primal Mama's  power, or rivals for spiritual authority).]`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose:  Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
    *   `- Property ID: MODAL-JEB-0 1`
        *   *Property:* `Erpenthropic Nature (Alethic/Epistemic Exception )`
        *   *Description:* `Authenticated ability to physically transform into a formidable Alligator Beast Man; possesses near- immortality; innately driven to seek "truth" as per Erpenthrope kind.`
        *    *Limits:* `Transformation is taxing; near-immortality does not mean invulnerability; "truth" is subjective  and filtered through his unique perspective.`
        *   *Authentication:* `[PMCILP - Erpenthrope rules ]`
    *   `- Property ID: MODAL-JEB-02`
        *   *Property:*  `Minor Solar Attunement (Alethic)`
        *   *Description:* `Possesses a subtle, inherent  ability to draw sustenance/energy from solar power, beyond baseline human, tied to his Erpenthrope nature. Not as  efficient as GE Alligators but aids endurance and post-transformation recovery.`
        *   *Limits:* `Cannot survive  on solar alone; still requires gator meat. Prolonged darkness or severe cloud cover will weaken him more than a typical  human over time.`
        *   *Authentication:* `[This Codex, consistent with PMCILP Solar Dominance &  Alligator Biogenesis]`

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the  character's value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Swamp Folk): [V aries: 'Wise Old Man,' 'Gator-Touched Saint,' 'Harmless Crazy,' 'He Who Speaks with Spirits  and Sun.']` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Reputation (Beetriot Elite /  Oligarchs): [Likely 'Superstitious Detritus,' 'Potential Source of Unrest if he gains followers,' ' Irrelevant Swamp Hermit.']` # Auth: [This Codex, logical inference from PMCILP]
    *   `-  Reputation (Other Erpenthropes): [Possibly 'The Devout One,' 'The Star-Gazer,'  or 'He Who Chases Ghosts of Men.']` # Auth: [This Codex, potential internal Erpenthrope views ]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated as fundamentally Sincere and Benign in his quest , seeking spiritual understanding, though his methods and conclusions are eccentric. His "truth" is a spiritual one, not necessarily  factual in a mundane sense.]` # Auth: [This Codex, Narrator Tone]
    *   `# Axi ological Undersaturation: [Specific views from Swamp Witch communities; reputation among Automaton/LLM users (he'd likely condemn  their use as "soul-staining").]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose:  Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as an Erp enthrope active since at least the early post-Calamity period. Remembers the world before the mass proliferation of GE All igators and the full deification of the Trio.]` # Auth: [This Codex, based on near-immortality ]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection (Subjective): [Claims to have once, in his youth ( centuries ago), seen a "Chariot of Fire with a Screaming Chicken painted on its hood" (a Trans  Am) which he considers his first "vision." Witnessed the societal shift away from cattle firsthand.]` # Auth: [This Codex ]
    *   `- Inherited Items:** [His primary "sacred texts": a water-damaged movie poster for "G ator," a cracked 8-track of Jerry Reed's "East Bound and Down," and a few singed pages  purported to be from Gram Parsons' personal notebook (authenticity highly dubious but cherished by Jeb).]` # Auth: [This Codex ]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Specifics of his life before dedicating himself to this quest;  any direct interaction with the Deified Trio (highly unlikely, but he might claim spiritual communion that feels like memory). His  own Erpenthrope lineage/origin.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize  the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:**  `Brother Jebediah is constituted as an ancient, truth-seeking Erpenthrope who has found his ultimate " truth" in the unlikely divinity of 20th-century celebrities. His existence is a living embodiment of Primal Mama's  "strangely spiritual miasma," blending sincere faith with the patently absurd. His near-immortality gives  him a unique perspective on the transience of human works versus the enduring power of belief and the "spirit" he perceives in the De ified Trio and the 1970s aesthetic. He is a wandering prophet of a uniquely Primal Maman gospel , seeking communion with gods made of celluloid, vinyl, and legend, all under the omnipresent solar gaze.`
*   ** Primary Narrative Function:** `To embody and explore the unique spiritual dimension of Primal Mama. Acts as a source of esoteric  lore, philosophical musings, and unexpected wisdom. Can serve as a quest-giver, a mystical guide, a prophetic  voice, or a poignant example of faith in a bizarre world. His quest for "God" can mirror or contrast with other characters ' quests for more material or mundane goals.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The Erpenthrope 's innate drive for tangible "truth" versus the abstract, often contradictory nature of his chosen faith. The immense loneliness  of his unique, long-lived perspective and singular devotion. Interpreting the flawed, human actions of his "gods" ( as depicted in their "scriptures") through a divine lens. The struggle to convey his profound spiritual insights to a largely  uncomprehending world.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could uncover a "lost  relic" or "sacred site" related to one of the Trio. Might attract a small following, forcing him into  a leadership role. Could have a crisis of faith if confronted with irrefutable evidence contradicting a core tenet, or  conversely, have a profound revelatory experience that solidifies his beliefs. His interaction with actual ghosts might yield "messages" from the de ified. He might eventually seek to understand the "Invisible Women" conspiracy through a spiritual, rather than purely conspiratorial, lens.`
