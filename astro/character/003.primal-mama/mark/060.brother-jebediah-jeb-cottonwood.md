# Based on Doležel's Heter ocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm . Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by  the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition** .*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose  complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the  heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
    *   `-  Appearance_General: [Human male, appears late 50s to early 60s, lean and wiry from a  life of austerity and movement. Skin deeply tanned and weathered from sun and swamp exposure.]` # Auth: [This Codex ]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Kind, though often sorrowful, pale blue eyes that seem to look  through rather than at. A sparse, grey-white beard, usually neatly trimmed with a simple blade. Long, thinning  hair often tied back with a strip of alligator leather.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `-  Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [A faded, intricate tattoo of an unknown, non-celebrity religious symbol partially visible  on his left forearm, often obscured by his sleeve – possibly pre-calamity or a self-inked design based  on found texts.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Wears  simple, durable clothes patched multiple times, often made of rough-spun plant fibers or repurposed canvas, dyed with natural pigments (muted  greens, browns). Always carries a worn satchel made of GE alligator hide (a gift, or scavenged). His  few metal items (buckle, knife hilt) are dull, unpolished, reflecting the 1970s  practical aesthetic rather than shine.]` # Auth: [This Codex / PM Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic]
    *    `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Soft-spoken, with a gentle Southern drawl. Speech is deliberate, often quoting  from fragmented, seemingly pre-calamity texts he carries. Voice can rise with surprising passion when speaking of "The Un namable Light" or "The True Word." Avoids common curses, substituting them with phrases like "Oh, the sorrow  of it!" or "By the Lost Stars!"]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Gait/ Mannerisms: [Slow, methodical gait, using a sturdy cypress staff for balance in rough terrain. Often pauses to observe nature  or listen intently, as if expecting a sign. A habit of tracing patterns in the dirt with his staff while speaking.] ` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Faint scent  of damp earth, woodsmoke, old paper/papyrus, and occasionally a faint whiff of whatever herbal poultice he' s currently using.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [ Exact height/weight, specific details of his pre-calamity symbol tattoo, origins of all scars beyond general wear.] `

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
    *   `- Skill: [Exceptional Swamp Navigation  & Survival (Foraging, finding potable water, basic shelter construction).]` # Auth: [Narrative descriptions of his lifestyle ]
    *   `- Skill: [Basic Herbalism (Swamp flora for medicinal/sustenance purposes, non -magical).]` # Auth: [Narrative descriptions]
    *   `- Skill: [Recitation &  Interpretation of Fragmented Pre-Calamity "Holy" Texts (Possesses a collection of water-damaged pages,  tries to piece together a coherent theology).]` # Auth: [Narrative focus]
    *   `- Skill:  [Basic repair of simple, non-electrical 1970s-era tools (e.g., hand -cranked lanterns, water filters, sharpening tools) using salvaged parts.]` # Auth: [PM Coherence Protocol -  Tech Aesthetic]
    *   `- Ability (Unique): [Possesses an unusual degree of empathy and intuitive insight into the emotional /spiritual state of others and places; not supernatural power, but a heightened sensitivity honed by his contemplative life and focus on  the "spiritual miasma" of Primal Mama.]` # Auth: [Narrative depiction of his interactions]
    *    `- Limitation (Physical): [Not physically strong; avoids confrontation. Suffers from occasional swamp fevers or ailments due to exposure .]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Largely ignorant of advanced  GE technology specifics, Beetriot high society, and the intricacies of the meat oligarchy's politics. His knowledge of  "God" is based on incomplete, possibly misinterpreted, texts.]` # Auth: [This Codex / PM Coherence Protocol -  Epistemic]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Possesses no formal authority or resources. Often viewed as  an eccentric or harmless fool by those devoted to the celebrity deities or focused solely on survival/commerce.]` # Auth: [This  Codex / PM Coherence Protocol - Axiological]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Ability to perform  complex rituals for ghost interaction (he seeks a different kind of spirit); proficiency with firearms (abhors violence).]`

**3 . Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**

    *   `- Key Motiv ator: [To understand and connect with the "True Divine." To find and share authentic spiritual solace in a world of  artifice and hardship. To bear witness to a different path.]` # Auth: [Explicit statements, Narrative focus]
    *    `- Key Belief: [Believes that the deified celebrities are, at best, distractions or misinterpretations of a deeper , singular spiritual reality. Believes fragments of true wisdom survived the Calamity and can guide humanity if properly understood.]`  # Auth: [Dialogue, Preaching]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [His unwavering faith vs. the overwhelming  evidence of a bizarre, often cruel world. The pull of solitude for contemplation vs. the compassionate urge to minister to others.  The difficulty of conveying his abstract spiritual concepts to people focused on tangible deities and survival.]` # Auth: [Internal Mon ologue, Difficult Choices]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Faint, dreamlike memories of stories  told by an elder (perhaps a grandparent) about "The One God" before the Calamity. The core of his " scriptures" are pages he found or was given, their origin uncertain.]` # Auth: [Backstory elements]

    *    `- Official Role: [None. Self-styled "Seeker of the Lost Word," itinerant preacher/hermit.]` #  Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Social Status: [Outsider. Tolerated in some remote swamp communities ( e.g., Lickskillet outskirts) as a harmless eccentric who sometimes offers comfort or wisdom.

    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: [None.

    *    `- Key Relationship 1: [To the memory of his "Elder" (Grandparent? Mentor?): A  guiding spiritual presence, source of his initial faith.]` # Auth: [Internal Monologue, Backstory]

        *   *Property:* ` [Heightened Spiritual Sensitivity (Epistemic/Axiological Exception)]`
        *   *Description:* `Authenticated  as possessing an unusually profound intuitive connection to the underlying "spiritual miasma" of Primal Mama. Can sense strong emotional or spiritual " residues" in places or people, and has a deep, non-analytical conviction about the presence of a singular divine  force. This is not ghost-seeing (which requires ritual) or Erpenthropic transformation.]`
        *    *Limits:* `[Purely intuitive and passive; cannot be controlled or directed to find specific information. Can be emotionally  overwhelming. Offers no physical protection or conventional power. Susceptible to misinterpretation based on his existing textual framework.]`
         *   *Authentication:* `[Narrative descriptions of his intuitive "readings" of situations or people, contrasting with others ' perceptions; his unwavering conviction despite lack of "proof" by world standards.]` # Auth: [This Codex,  Future Narratives]

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
    *   `- Reputation ( Swamp Dwellers / Lickskillet Outskirts): [Authenticated as viewed as 'odd but harmless', 'the  God-talker', 'sometimes wise', 'a comfort in dark times for some'. His self-sufficiency and swamp  knowledge earn grudging respect.]` # Auth: [Character interactions]
    *   `- Reputation (Celebrity Cultists /  Beetriot): [Authenticated as likely viewed as 'blasphemous', 'delusional', 'irrelevant', or  'dangerously misguided' if he gains any traction. His rejection of the deified celebrities would be a direct challenge to their value  system.]` # Auth: [PM Coherence Protocol - Axiological (Celebrity Deities)]
    *    `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via narrative focus as fundamentally good, sincere, and compassionate, seeking a deeper  spiritual truth in a world that has largely forgotten or replaced it. His "service to find God" is genuine.]` # Auth:  [Narrator tone, actions]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [Reputation among Er penthropes (might see him as a curious anomaly or a fellow seeker of a different kind of truth); Meat  Oligarchy's view (likely irrelevant unless he interferes with labor/resources).]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past  Links):**
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as originating from a forgotten, isolated swamp community that held onto  fragmented pre-Calamity religious beliefs. These beliefs were passed down orally and through scant surviving texts.]` # Auth:  [Backstory sketch]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection (Subjective): [A profound personal experience ( e.g., surviving a great storm, a moment of intense clarity in the deep swamp, the death of his Elder ) that solidified his calling to seek and spread the "True Word."]` # Auth: [Backstory element]
    *    `- Inherited Items:** [Authenticated to possess a worn leather satchel containing scraps of pre-Calamity paper  and parchment (his "scriptures"), a simple wooden carving of his faith's symbol, and his Elder's walking  staff.]` # Auth: [Narrative inventory]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [The  exact teachings of his Elder; the precise content and origin of all his scriptural fragments; any direct knowledge of the Biological  Calamity's cause (likely interprets it through a spiritual lens).]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.* 

*   **Core Essence:** `Brother Jebediah Cottonwood is constituted as a conduit for a lost, or perhaps nascent , spirituality in Primal Mama. He is a man whose entire being is dedicated to seeking a singular, benevolent Divine in  a world dominated by retro-futuristic pragmatism, celebrity deification, and bizarre biological realities. His Functional skills are  those of survival and gentle ministry, his Psychological makeup is one of unwavering faith tempered by compassionate sorrow. His Social position is that  of an outsider, a voice in the wilderness. His unique Modal property (Spiritual Sensitivity) isn't a power , but a lens through which he experiences Primal Mama's "spiritual miasma," reinforcing his quest for a God beyond the superficial . He embodies the tension between ancient faith and a radically altered present, all filtered through the ubiquitous 1970s aesthetic  in his simple tools and worldview.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To represent an alternative spiritual path and offer  a critique of the world's dominant belief systems. To be a source of potentially forgotten wisdom or a different kind of "truth " than that sought by Erpenthropes. To provide comfort and moral counterpoint. His quest for "God"  can drive plots involving lost knowledge, hidden sanctuaries, or encounters with other beings who perceive the world's deeper strangeness.` 
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The challenge of maintaining faith in an absurd and often hostile world. The  loneliness of his unique calling vs. his desire to connect and minister. Reconciling his fragmented ancient texts with the bizarre  reality of Primal Mama (e.g., how do solar-powered alligators or vampire bunnies fit into his theology ?). The temptation of despair vs. his core of stubborn hope.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle): ** `Discovering more complete or clarifying pre-Calamity texts. Encountering others who share his specific faith or forming  a more organized spiritual community. His faith being severely tested by a direct confrontation with the world's harshness or the  seemingly divine power of an Erpenthrope/Swamp Witch. Finding unexpected common ground with a "truth-seeking"  Erpenthrope. His interpretations of "God" evolving as he learns more about the world.`
