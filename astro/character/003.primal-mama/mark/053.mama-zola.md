# Story World Codex: Fictional Person  Constitution Protocol
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property  Bundle)

**World:** Primal Mama
**Codex Version:** 0.2 - Character Constitution
**Last Updated:**  [Current Date]

## Introduction : Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters,  significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by  the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no  independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties  across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated  bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**:  define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

 ### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heteroc osm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's  tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Elderly woman of clear African descent, perhaps in her late  60s or 70s, though remarkably spry. Dark, weathered skin etched with fine lines that speak of sun , swamp, and contemplation. Her bearing is one of quiet dignity and intense focus.]` # Auth: [This Codex] 
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Piercing, intelligent dark eyes that seem to see beyond the surface. High cheek bones. Her hair is a crown of silver and black locs, intricately woven with small, polished alligator teeth, iridescent  beetle carapaces, and strangely shaped swamp seeds. Often wears a single, large, handcrafted brass earring in one ear,  shaped like a stylized ankh or a spiral.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinct ive Marks: [A faint, old burn scar tracing a spiral pattern on her left forearm, origin unknown but rumored to be from  one of her 'experiments'. Subtle, ritualistic scarification patterns on her temples, barely visible beneath her hairline.]` # Auth : [This Codex]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Practical, hand-stitched clothing made from durable , swamp-dyed fabrics (muted greens, browns, deep reds). Often wears a heavy shawl or wrap, even in warmer weather , woven with complex patterns that seem to shift in the light. Favors sturdy, waterproof boots made from GE alligator hide ( non-consumable parts). Adorned with handcrafted jewelry made from swamp materials and scavenged 1970 s-era electronic components (e.g., capacitors as beads, wire-wrapped resistors as pendants).]` # Auth:  [This Codex, Primal Mama Coherence Doc - 1970s Aesthetic]
    *   `- Voice/ Speech Pattern: [A rich, contralto voice, usually calm and measured, with a slight, musical lilt.  Speaks thoughtfully, often pausing. Can become surprisingly forceful when discussing her convictions. Her speech is peppered with unique metaphors drawn  from swamp ecology and her esoteric theories.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Gait/M annerisms: [Moves with a deliberate, unhurried grace. Has a habit of tilting her head as if listening to  something others cannot hear. Hands are expressive, often gesturing to illustrate complex points or tracing patterns in the air.]` # Auth : [This Codex]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [A complex aroma of sweetgrass  incense, damp earth, ozone (from her jury-rigged equipment), and a faint, unidentifiable metallic tang .]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/ weight, specific tribal/ancestral markings beyond general description, details of her dwelling's interior beyond functionality.]`

** 2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and * cannot* do.*
    *   `- Skill: [Mastery of Local Ritual Magic for Spectral Interaction (Can reliably  perceive and attempt communication with ghosts, possibly with unique insights or methods beyond common practitioners).]` # Auth: [This Codex, Primal  Mama Coherence Doc - Spectral Interaction]
    *   `- Skill: [Proficient Herbalist & Forager ( Deep knowledge of swamp flora, both mundane and potentially psychoactive/spiritually significant, for use in rituals and 'experiments'). ]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Skill: [Jury-Rigging 1970 s-Style Technology (Can repurpose and modify discarded analog electronics – radios, oscilloscopes, signal generators with chunky buttons and wood  paneling – into devices she believes help 'tune in' to or measure divine/spiritual frequencies. This tech adheres strictly  to the 1970s aesthetic constraint).]` # Auth: [This Codex, Primal Mama Coherence Doc -  Technological Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `- Skill: [Deep Listener / Spiritual Counselor (Many seek her out for her  unorthodox wisdom, even if they fear her methods).]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Ability ( Unique): [Heightened Sensitivity to 'World Harmonics' (A self-described ability to perceive subtle shifts in the spiritual  'atmosphere' of Primal Mama, which she interprets as fluctuations in the divine presence or the veil between worlds. This is more  nuanced than general ghost perception).]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Elder ly, not suited for strenuous physical combat or labor. Relies on knowledge and wit over brawn.]` # Auth: [This  Codex]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Her understanding of advanced GE science or pre-calamity  high technology is limited to its esoteric potential; she doesn't grasp the full scientific underpinnings. Her theories about ' God' are highly speculative and unproven, even within the world's logic.]` # Auth: [This Codex ]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Viewed as eccentric at best, a dangerous heretic at worst,  especially by staunch followers of the deified celebrities or those benefiting from the status quo. Her influence is limited to those who actively  seek her out.]` # Auth: [This Codex, Primal Mama Coherence Doc - Deified Celebrities] 
    *   `- Limitation (Resources): [Her 'laboratory' is a secluded shack filled with scavenged and repurposed  items. Lacks access to significant material wealth or official power structures.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *    `# Functional Undersaturation: [Specifics of her ritual incantations; the exact schematics of her jury -rigged devices; ability to handle firearms (likely low).]`

**3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's textually constituted inner life.*
    *   `- Core Trait:  [Unshakeable, Obsessive Faith (in the existence of a discoverable, singular 'True God' or 'Prime  Source' beyond the celebrity deities or nature spirits).]` # Auth: [This Codex, Actions]
    *   `- Core  Trait: [Profound Intellectual & Spiritual Curiosity (Drives her 'experiments' and lifelong quest).]` # Auth:  [This Codex]
    *   `- Core Trait: [Deep Skepticism (Towards established dogmas,  including the divinity of Reynolds, Reed, and Parsons, and simplistic interpretations of the Calamity or Erpenthrope  nature).]` # Auth: [Dialogue, Primal Mama Coherence Doc - Deified Celebrities]
    *    `- Dominant Emotion: [A blend of intense Hope (of discovery) and solemn Serenity (from her connection to the swamp  and her ongoing quest), occasionally undercut by Frustration at the limitations of her understanding or the obfuscation she perceives in the world.]`  # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Key Motivator: [To directly perceive, understand, and perhaps  commune with the ultimate divine principle she believes underpins Primal Mama. Possibly to find an answer to the 'why' of the  Calamity that transcends mere biological explanation.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Key Belief:  [Believes that 'God' leaves 'fingerprints' on reality (physical, spiritual, technological) that can be  detected and interpreted through a syncretic approach of ritual, meditation, and 'attuned' 1970 s-era technology. Believes the deified celebrities are, at best, powerful thought-forms or lesser spirits, not the  Prime Source.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [The drive for empirical , repeatable 'experimental' results vs. the inherently subjective and unquantifiable nature of spiritual experience. Her desire for communion  with the divine vs. the inherent dangers of meddling with unknown forces/entities. Her ancestral spiritual leanings vs. the  strange new spiritual landscape of Primal Mama.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content : [Possesses vivid memories of the world *before* the full cultural entrenchment of the celebrity deities, allowing  her a unique perspective. Remembers early interpretations of the Calamity. Carries oral traditions from her lineage that speak  of different gods or spirits, which she now tries to reconcile with her current quest.]` # Auth: [This Codex ]
    *   `# Psychological Undersaturation: [Specific details of traumatic experiences (if any) that cemented  her quest; her opinions on mundane politics unless they intersect with her spiritual work; her full theory of the 'Invisible Women' conspiracy ( she likely has one, but it's complex and esoteric).]`

**4. Social / Relational / Categor ical Properties (Authenticated Position):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's place within the world's networks .*
    *   `- Official Role: [None. She is self-defined as a 'Seeker' or 'Listener '.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Social Status: [Fringe figure. Respected by a  few for her wisdom and courage, feared or dismissed by many as a "swamp crazy" or heretic. Ex ists outside the mainstream Lickskillet or Beetriot social structures.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *    `- Primary Affiliation: [Unaffiliated. Solitary practitioner, though may occasionally barter knowledge or services with Swamp Witches or other  isolated individuals if their goals align temporarily.]` # Auth: [This Codex, Primal Mama Coherence Doc - Swamp  Witches]
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: [None formal. Erpenthropes might be subjects  of her study or cautious curiosity due to their unique nature and longevity, seeing them as closer to some 'primal truth '.]` # Auth: [This Codex, Primal Mama Coherence Doc - Erpenthropes]
    *    `- Key Relationship 1: [To 'The Divine Presence' (Abstract): Her primary, all-consuming relationship is  with the object of her search.]` # Auth: [Motivations]
    *   `- Key Relationship 2: [ To Seekers/Disciples (Potential): Characters who come to her for answers might form temporary or lasting bonds, becoming  informal students or fellow experimenters.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Key Relationship 3:  [To Adherents of Celebrity Deities (Antagonistic/Dismissive): She likely views their faith as misplaced , leading to potential friction if they interact.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Doc - Deified Celebrities] 
    *   `- Species/Type: [Human (Baseline Post-Calamity Strain)]` # Auth: [This Codex ]
    *   `# Social Undersaturation: [Specific individuals who are her allies or enemies; her family history  beyond 'lineage with oral traditions'.]`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose:  Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
    *   `- Property ID: MODAL-ZOLA-01`
         *   *Property:* `[Exceptional Attunement to Spiritual Frequencies (Epistemic/Aleth ic Exception)]`
        *   *Description:* `[Authenticated ability to perceive and interact with spiritual energies, spectral  phenomena, and what she terms 'divine harmonics' with greater clarity and through unique methods (her 197 0s tech-ritual hybrid) than standard ghost-seers or Swamp Witches. This may allow her to gle an information or experience phenomena others cannot access.]`
        *   *Limits:* `[Her interpretations are subjective and filtered  through her unique belief system. The 'technology' is as much ritual focus as functional device. Does not grant power * over* these forces, only perception and attempted interaction. Can be physically and mentally draining.]`
        *   * Authentication:* `[Narrative descriptions of her 'experiments' yielding results (e.g., unique ghostly communications, localized  sensory phenomena) not achievable by others; her consistent adherence to the 1970s aesthetic even in these esoteric  pursuits.]` # Auth: [This Codex, Primal Mama Coherence Doc - Spectral Interaction, Tech Aesthetic]

** 6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's value  status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet Populace): [Authenticated  as viewed with a mix of awe, fear, and pity. 'That strange old Mama Zola, poking at things  best left alone with her humming boxes and incense. Might know a cure for swamp fever, or might call something nasty up  from the mud. Best keep your distance, 'less you're desperate. Definitely don't mention Burt Reynolds in  a bad light around her.']` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Reputation (Swamp Witches):  [Authenticated as viewed with cautious respect, and perhaps some professional jealousy or amusement. 'She walks a different path, touches  different threads. Sometimes her noise aligns with the whispers, sometimes it scatters them. Not one of us, but not  entirely against us.']` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Reputation (Erpenthrop es, if aware): [Might see her as either an amusingly persistent gnat, a potential source of novel (if flawed)  insight into the 'lesser' beings' spiritual fumblings, or perhaps even a rare mortal who dimly perceives fragments of deeper  truths they embody.]` # Auth: [This Codex, Primal Mama Coherence Doc - Erpenthropes &  Truth]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated as fundamentally driven by a sincere, albeit highly  eccentric, quest for ultimate truth and connection, making her actions understandable even if unconventional or disturbing to some. Not malevolent, but her  experiments could have unintended consequences.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `# Axiological Unders aturation: [Her reputation in Beetriot (likely non-existent or purely legendary); specific views of the Meat Oligarch s (she'd likely find their materialism spiritually barren).]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated  as hailing from a lineage that maintained syncretic Afro-spiritual traditions, adapting them through the Biological Calamity and  into the current era. She represents a continuity of older beliefs, now heavily modified by her personal quest and the Primal Mama environment.] ` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection (Subjective): [The Biological  Calamity is the pivotal event that shattered old certainties and set her on the path to find a 'God' adequate  to explain or transcend such a transformation. She may have specific, haunting memories of its onset and aftermath.]` # Auth : [This Codex, Primal Mama Coherence Doc - Biological Calamity]
    *   `- Inherited Items :** [Authenticated to possess a few pre-calamity ancestral spiritual objects (e.g., a worn carving, a specific  bead pattern) which she incorporates into her rituals and technological arrays, believing them to be 'anchors' or 'resonators'. ]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Specifics of her community  before she became more solitary; details of her teachers or spiritual predecessors; her direct experiences during the rise of the celebrity cults.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Mama Zola is constituted as a bridge  between ancient spiritual yearning and the retro-futuristic, bayou-infused reality of Primal Mama. She is an  ontologically persistent seeker, defined by her relentless, experimental pursuit of a 'True God' in a world saturated with synthetic  deities (celebrities) and strange new life (GE gators, Erpenthropes). Her Functional capabilities (ritual , tech-rigging, herbalism) are entirely subservient to her Psychological drive (faith, curiosity, skepticism of  norms). Her Social isolation is a product of her unique Modal attunement and Axiological variance from mainstream beliefs. She embodies  Primal Mama's theme of "strangely spiritual miasma" and the desperate search for meaning after catastrophe,  all filtered through the mandatory 1970s Technological Aesthetic.]`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** ` [Potential Wisdom Figure providing esoteric knowledge or unique perspectives on the world's mysteries; a Quest Giver for characters seeking deeper  spiritual understanding or solutions to problems beyond the mundane; a Thematic Resonator for questions of faith, reality, and the nature  of divinity in Primal Mama; a potential foil or unorthodox ally to Erpenthropes or Swamp Witches.] `
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `[The tension between her deep, intuitive faith and her  desire for 'verifiable' experimental contact with the divine. Her reverence for the natural/spiritual world vs. her manipulation of it through  ritual and tech. The loneliness of her unique path vs. the occasional need/desire for connection or to share her insights.  Reconciling ancestral beliefs with the bizarre new realities of Primal Mama.]`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on  Bundle):** `[Making a genuine breakthrough in her 'experiments' (Modal/Epistemic change), attracting a small  group of followers (Social change), facing direct opposition from established cults (Plot), or perhaps even confronting an Erpenthrope about  the nature of 'truth' and divinity (Thematic/Epistemic challenge). Her theories could evolve based on new discoveries  or interactions. She might be instrumental in understanding a deeper layer of the Primal Mama world's metaphysics.]`
