# Story World Codex: Fictional Person Constitution Protocol
# Based  on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

**World:** Primal  Mama
**Codex Version:** 0.2 - Character Constitution
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]
**Lead  Architect(s):** [Your Name / Studio Name]

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Text ually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

 *(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1.  Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *    `- Appearance_General: [Elderly woman, appearing to be in her late 60s or early 70s , with rich, dark brown skin that holds the intricate map of her years. She possesses distinct West African facial features –  high cheekbones, a broad, kind nose, and full lips. Her bearing is upright and dignified, despite her age.]`  # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Her eyes are a startling ly bright, intelligent hazel, often narrowed in deep thought or wide with observant curiosity. Her hair is a crown of tight , silver-white coils, sometimes adorned with small, hand-carved wooden beads or polished alligator teeth – sourced respectfully .]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [Faint, intricate  scarification patterns on her temples and forearms, barely visible now, suggesting adherence to traditions that may pre-date or diverge from  mainstream post-calamity culture. A prominent mole above her right eyebrow.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
     *   `- Typical Attire: [Wears practical, layered clothing suitable for the swamp environment, made from durable , natural-fiber fabrics (dyed with plant-based pigments in earthy tones of ochre, deep green, and muddy  brown) combined with repurposed textiles that vaguely echo the 1970s aesthetic in their patterns or weave, but not  in their manufacture. Often wears a wide-brimmed hat woven from swamp reeds. Her boots are sturdy and waterproof , often patched.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / PM Coherence (1970s aesthetic constraint  adaptation)]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [A low, resonant voice that carries a melodic, rhythmic  cadence. Speaks slowly and deliberately, choosing her words with care. Her accent is unique, hinting at a linguistic heritage not  commonly found in Lickskillet or Beetriot, possibly an older Creole or a preserved ancestral language blended with the common  Primal Mama tongue.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms:  [Moves with a surprising agility for her age, her steps sure and quiet in the swamp. Has a habit of pausing  to listen intently to her surroundings, or gently touching plants and strange fungi. Often seen sketching in a weathered, hand-bound  journal with charcoal.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any ): [Faint aroma of damp earth, sweetgrass, woodsmoke, and a subtle, unidentifiable herbal conco ction she uses.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact  height and weight, specific tribal or ancestral group her features derive from beyond "West African," the precise meaning of her scar ification.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character * can* and *cannot* do.*
    *   `- Skill: [Expert Knowledge of Swamp Ecology (Flora, Fauna, F ungi – both mundane and post-calamity unique, including behaviors of vampire bunnies and some understanding of GE alligator needs /limits from observation).]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / PM Coherence (Vampire Bunnies, GE  Alligators)]
    *   `- Skill: [Proficient in Folk Rituals & Spirit Communication (Can perform rituals , often involving natural components and resonant frequencies from handmade instruments, to perceive and sometimes interact with ghosts, per the world's rules . Her methods are distinct from more "mainstream" Swamp Witch practices).]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / PM Coherence  (Spectral Interaction)]
    *   `- Skill: [Basic Herbalism & Toxin Identification (Can identify many edible , medicinal, and poisonous swamp plants; creates her own poultices and infusions. Understands the "death by burger"  effect as a profound biological/spiritual incompatibility).]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / PM Coherence (Biological Cal amity Aftermath)]
    *   `- Skill: [Observational "Science" (Conducts meticulous, long -term observations of natural and supernatural phenomena in her pursuit of understanding "God"/Primal Source; her "experiments" involve  creating specific environmental conditions, offerings, or soundscapes to observe reactions from the spiritual fabric of the world).]` # Auth:  [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Ability (Unique): [Heightened Sensitivity to Environmental/Spiritual Shifts ( Can often sense impending strange weather, unusual spiritual activity, or areas where the "veil" is thin, not unlike a folk  version of Erpenthrope senses but without transformation).]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Limitation ( Physical): [Age-related stamina limitations; not a physical combatant. Relies on knowledge and avoidance.]` # Auth: [ This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Lacks formal knowledge of advanced genetic engineering or solar tech  beyond observation of its effects (e.g., GE gators). Her understanding of the "Biological Calamity"  is through a lens of spiritual imbalance rather than pure science. Unfamiliar with Beetriot elite culture.]` # Auth: [This Codex  Entry / PM Coherence (Solar Dominance, Tech Aesthetic Constraint)]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Oper ates outside established power structures (Meat Oligarchy, Beetriot elite); her influence is localized and based on respect/fear, not authority . Views Automaton/LLM users with deep suspicion, seeing them as further detaching from lived truth.]` #  Auth: [This Codex Entry / PM Coherence (Automaton/LLM User Stigma)]
    *   ` # Functional Undersaturation: [Specifics of all rituals; full catalog of known plants/spirits; whether her  sensitivity could be trained further.]`

**3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**
   *Purpose:  Define the character's textually constituted inner life.*
    *   `- Core Trait: [Deeply Inquisitive  / Philosophical]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry, Narrative Function]
    *   `- Core Trait: [Patient  / Observant]` # Auth: [Mannerisms, Functional Skills]
    *   `- Core Trait: [ Spiritually Skeptical (of established deities like Reynolds, Reed, Parsons, seeing them as constructs or powerful spirits, but not the  Ultimate Source)]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / PM Coherence (Deified Celebrities)]
    *    `- Dominant Emotion: [A calm, profound Serenity mixed with an unyielding Curiosity]` # Auth: [Voice , Mannerisms]
    *   `- Key Motivator: [To understand the fundamental nature of existence/divinity in Pr imal Mama; to find the "True God" or "Primal Source" she believes underpins the world's strange spiritual  miasma and the Calamity itself.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry, Narrative Function]
    *    `- Key Belief: [Believes the current "gods" are distractions or powerful manifestations, not the origin. Bel ieves direct, respectful interaction with the natural/supernatural world can reveal deeper truths. Believes the Calamity was a spiritual  wound as much as a biological one.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / PM Coherence (Epistemic Mod ality)]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [The isolation of her unique quest vs. a quiet desire for shared  understanding; frustration with the superficiality of common beliefs vs. her gentle nature; the personal risks her "experiments" might  entail.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Rich repository  of oral traditions, folk tales, and personal observations of the swamp's changes since her youth. No direct memory of pre -calamity, but her traditions might contain echoes.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *    `# Psychological Undersaturation: [Specifics of her childhood, her exact definition of "God," detailed opinions  on mundane politics beyond a general detachment.]`

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's place within the world's networks.*
    *   `- Official Role : [None. Unofficial spiritual advisor/herbalist to a small, isolated swamp community or individuals who seek her out.] ` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Social Status: [Outsider mystic; respected by  a few, viewed as eccentric or even unsettling by many in Lickskillet. Unknown in Beetriot.]` # Auth: [ This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Primary Affiliation: [To her quest for truth and the specific patch of swamp she considers  her "laboratory" and home.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations:  [Loose, wary, but sometimes mutually beneficial contact with certain independent alligator harvesters (trading herbs for information or rare items ). Distant and suspicious of organized Swamp Witches, seeing their magic as often transactional or lacking depth, though she acknowledges  their power with vampire bunnies.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / PM Coherence (Vampire Bunny Propagation)]
     *   `- Key Relationship 1: [To "The Swamp Itself": Views it as a living, communicative entity, her  primary source of study and spiritual connection.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Key Relationship 2:  [To Local Spirits/Ghosts: Engages with them as sources of information or subjects of her "experiments," always with respect but  also with a scientific detachment.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / PM Coherence (Spectral Interaction)]
     *   `- Key Relationship 3: [To Erpenthropes (if encountered): Would be fascinated by them,  seeing them as closer to the "Primal Source" or as key to understanding it. Might seek them out cautiously, believing  they are "truth seekers" too.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / PM Coherence (Erpenthropic Transformation , Erpenthrope Knowledge)]
    *   `- Species/Type: [Human (Primal Mama strain,  with distinct ancestral heritage)]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `# Social Undersaturation : [Specific names of community members who consult her; any living family; precise nature of any past dealings with Swamp Witches.]`

   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world  laws.*
    *   `- Property ID: MODAL-MZOLA-01`
        *   *Property:*  `[Attuned Environmental/Spiritual Perception (Epistemic/Alethic Exception)]`
        *   *Description:*  `[Through disciplined practice, unique heritage, and focused "experiments," Mama Zola possesses a capacity to perceive and interpret  subtle spiritual and environmental energies/disturbances beyond baseline human norms in Primal Mama, approaching but not equalling innate  Erpenthrope senses. This is learned and cultivated, not an inherent biological trait like Erpenthropy.]`
        *    *Limits:* `[Perception is passive/interpretive, not controlled manipulation of these energies. Requires focus and  specific conditions (e.g., rituals, quiet environment). Can be taxing.]`
        *   *Authentication:*  `[Narrative descriptions of her successful interpretations of subtle signs, interaction with ghosts beyond typical casual perception, and anticipation of anomalous  events as a result of her methods.]`
    *   `# Note: Her "exception" is an extreme  development of potential available within Primal Mama's rules (permeable veil, spiritual presence) rather than a complete break from  them.`

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the character 's value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Local Swamp Dwellers): [ Authenticated as viewed variably: 'wise woman,' 'harmless eccentric,' 'powerful (and slightly dangerous) spirit- talker,' 'keeper of old ways.' Source of unique remedies and sometimes unsettling insights.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry] 
    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet Mainstream): [If known at all, likely dismissed as 'sw amp hermit' or part of the general 'strange miasma' of the bayou. Her rejection of celebrity deities would  be seen as deeply odd.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / PM Coherence (Axiological Values -  Deified Celebrities)]
    *   `- Reputation (Swamp Witches): [Potentially viewed with suspicion or curiosity; her  methods are unorthodox compared to their established practices. They might see her as either naive or tapping into something they've overlooked /avoided.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [ Authenticated via her motivations and actions as genuinely seeking profound truth and understanding, operating from a place of respect for life and spirit , even if her methods are unconventional and her conclusions challenge established norms.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
     *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [How an Erpenthrope might perceive her; perception by  Meat Oligarchy agents if they became aware of her specific activities.]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin:  [Authenticated as born in a remote swamp community several decades post-calamity. Her lineage is suggested to have preserved  unique pre-calamity or divergent post-calamity spiritual traditions from an African heritage, adapted to the Pr imal Mama environment.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection (Subjective): [ Her "experiments" are partly an attempt to understand the spiritual dimension of the Biological Calamity, believing it fundamentally altered the world' s spiritual fabric and that understanding this is key to finding "God" or balance.]` # Auth: [This Codex  Entry / PM Coherence (The Calamity's Nature)]
    *   `- Inherited Items:** [Authenticated  to possess a few hand-carved ritual tools and a collection of oral histories/songs passed down through her maternal line , forming the basis of her unique spiritual framework and initial "experimental" hypotheses.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
     *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Specifics of her ancestral traditions; direct lineage details; verifiable pre-calamity  links of her traditions.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity,  internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Mama Zola  is constituted as a figure of profound spiritual inquiry existing on the fringes of Primal Mama's dominant culture. Her identity  is rooted in a unique blend of ancestral wisdom (African-derived, adapted to the swamp) and a relentless, almost  scientific, personal quest to "experimentally" verify the true nature of divinity and the spiritual laws of her bizarre world. She  rejects the superficiality of the celebrity gods and the perceived limitations of mainstream Swamp Witchery, seeking a deeper, more fundamental " Primal Source." Her Physical presence is one of aged dignity and attunement to nature; her Functional abilities lie in deep  ecological knowledge and unorthodox ritualism; her Psychological drive is an unwavering, patient search for ultimate truth. Socially, she is  an outsider, yet her wisdom provides a unique Axiological value to those who seek her.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:**  `To embody an alternative spiritual path within Primal Mama; to act as a source of deep, unconventional wisdom and lore ; to potentially guide protagonists towards understanding less obvious truths about the world, the Calamity, or the nature of entities  like Erpenthropes or ghosts; to demonstrate that "finding God" in Primal Mama is a deeply personal and potentially perilous  experiment.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The drive for solitary, profound truth vs. the subtle  need for connection/sharing knowledge; the limitations of her mortal lifespan against the vastness of her quest; interpreting the often  ambiguous or dangerous "results" of her spiritual experiments; navigating the fine line between seeker and "crazy swamp lady" in the  eyes of others.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Uncovering a significant piece of hidden  lore about the Calamity or the "Primal Source" through her experiments (Epistemic/Historical change); forming  an unexpected alliance with an Erpenthrope or a character seeking similar truths (Social/Relational change); her knowledge  becoming crucial to resolving a larger crisis; facing a direct challenge from established spiritual powers (Swamp Witches, devout followers of celebrity  gods) or those who misunderstand/fear her work.`
