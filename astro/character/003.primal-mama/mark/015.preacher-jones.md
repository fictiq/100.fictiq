## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity,  internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Pastor Jebedia h Jones is constituted as a beacon of traditional Christian faith and morality weathering the storm of Primal Mama's bizarre,  post-Calamity reality. His being is defined by an unwavering belief in a benevolent, though mysterious, God who provides  (even if that provision is solar-powered alligators) and judges (as seen in the Calamity and the prohibition  on cattle flesh – a reminder of past sins or a necessary new covenant). He interprets the world's strangeness—Er penthropes, celebrity deities, 1970s tech—through this theological lens, offering his L ickskillet flock (and any who will listen) a framework of hope, resilience, and enduring moral values. He embodies  the persistence of faith against overwhelming cultural and even biological shifts.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a moral  compass and a source of spiritual solace/interpretation within Lickskillet. To represent a contrasting belief system to the celebrity  cults and secular pragmatism. To offer a humanistic (faith-based) perspective on the world's more bizarre elements  (Erpenthropes, ghosts). He can be a source of wisdom, a voice of caution against societal excesses  (like the "Invisible Women" conspiracy or oligarchy greed), and a catalyst for community action rooted in compassion.`
*    **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Maintaining unwavering hope amidst pervasive weirdness and hardship. Reconciling ancient  scripture with current realities (e.g., GE gators, Erpenthropes). Resisting the allure of simplistic  answers (conspiracies, celebrity worship) for his flock. Grappling with the problem of suffering in a world so  clearly "touched" by transformative events. Deciding how to engage with those outside his faith (e.g., Erpenth ropes, Swamp Witches, celebrity cultists) – with condemnation, compassion, or cautious outreach?`
*    **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Deepening his theological understanding of Primal Mama's unique phenomena.  Facing a direct challenge to his faith from a powerful supernatural entity or a charismatic celebrity cult leader. Being forced to make difficult moral  choices that test his principles (e.g., collaborating with an Erpenthrope for a greater good). Expanding his ministry  or facing its persecution. Becoming a more vocal critic of the meat oligarchy or Beetriot's excesses, potentially facing  repercussions.`
