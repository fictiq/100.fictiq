## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides  the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heteroc osm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by  the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition** .*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose  complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character' s being within the Primal Mama heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Sturdy, well -muscled human male, appears late 30s to early 40s. Pronounced African features:  broad nose, strong jawline, dark skin tone that shows weathering from outdoor work and swamp humidity.]` # Auth: [ This Codex]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Kind, observant dark brown eyes, often crinkled at the  corners. Close-cropped kinky hair, flecked with early grey. Hands are large, calloused, and  immensely strong.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [Several  faded, silvery scars on his forearms and hands – testament to years handling alligator carcasses and sharp tools. A small, puck ered burn mark on his left cheek, from a grease splatter long ago.]` # Auth: [This Codex]
     *   `- Typical Attire: [Heavy-duty, often stained, dark green or brown canvas overalls over a simple , sweat-wicked t-shirt. Thick, cleated rubber boots suitable for slippery processing floors. Wears a well -worn, heavy rubber apron when actively butchering. Off-duty, favors simple denim trousers and plaid flannel shirts with  chunky buttons, consistent with late 1970s working-class aesthetic.]` # Auth: [This Codex /  Primal Mama World Rules - 1970s Tech Aesthetic]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Deep , resonant baritone with a distinct Louisiana/Gulf Coast drawl, typical of Lickskillet. Speaks thoughtfully, often with  colorful local idioms and a dry wit. His laugh is a warm, rumbling sound.]` # Auth: [This Codex ]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Economical, practiced movements when working, betraying deep  familiarity with his craft. Tends to stand with weight evenly distributed, solid and grounded. Habit of wiping his hands on his apron , even when not wearing one. Often squints slightly when assessing something, be it a gator carcass or a person .]` # Auth: [This Codex]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [A complex  mix: the faint, metallic tang of alligator blood (even when clean), antiseptic cleaning solutions, swamp humidity, old machinery oil , and a hint of cheap, spicy pipe tobacco if he's recently had a break.]` # Auth: [ This Codex]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/weight, specific brand of boots , full wardrobe details beyond work/casual staples.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize  the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:**  `Deacon "Deek" Washington is constituted as a bedrock of Lickskillet's working class, a skilled artisan  whose life is inextricably tied to the Primal Mama world's primary protein source: the alligator. His identity is forged  in the practical realities of his labor, the 1970s aesthetic of his tools and environment, and the  cultural norms of a society that reveres certain celebrities and abhors cattle flesh. He embodies pragmatism, resilience, and a quiet  pride in honest work, tinged with a wary skepticism towards the powerful and the unknown (from Beetriot oligarchs to  the deeper supernatural elements of the swamp, which he respects with practical caution). His African features root him visually in the diverse human tapestry  of this post-calamity Southern Gothic world.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `Serves as a grounded  perspective on the world of Primal Mama, particularly life in Lickskillet. He can act as an informant,  a source of local color and wisdom, a representative of the "common folk" impacted by larger events (like the meat oligarchy 's machinations or Erpenthrope activities), or a reluctant participant if conflict directly threatens his livelihood or community. He  highlights the dignity of manual labor and tradition in a retro-futuristic, spiritually strange setting.`
*   **Key Internal  Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Maintaining quality/tradition vs. Oligarchy pressure for efficiency/cost-cutting;  Loyalty to local community/small business vs. personal/economic survival; Innate pragmatism/skepticism vs. the  undeniable (if not fully understood) supernatural elements of his environment.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle): ** `Could be pushed into a leadership role among local processors if the oligarchy tightens its grip. Might be forced to confront or  seek aid from supernatural entities (Swamp Witches, Erpenthropes) if a crisis demands it. Could learn  to adapt some new (but still 1970s-aesthetic-compliant) technologies or methods if convinced of their practical  benefit and "cleanliness" (re: Automaton stigma). His understanding of the wider world could expand through interaction with outsiders .`
