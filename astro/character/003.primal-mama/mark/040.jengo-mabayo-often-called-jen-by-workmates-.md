## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Text ually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

Uses some unique colloquialisms from his community.]` # Auth: [Dialogue Snippets Draft]

### Character  Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from  the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `[Jengo Mabayo is constituted as a living testament  to the human cost of Primal Mama's retro-futuristic bio-industrial complex. His identity is forged in the tension  between his deep-rooted ancestral connection to the swamp (Physical, Functional, Psychological, Historical properties) and the brutal,  impersonal efficiency of the GE alligator meat oligarchy that has dispossessed him (Social, Functional limitations, Axiological devaluation). He is a  repository of lost knowledge and suppressed grief, forced to participate in the very system that destroyed his way of life. His African features and  cultural heritage mark him as part of a specific, historically marginalized community within the broader Primal Mama society, highlighting themes of cultural erasure  alongside economic exploitation.]`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `[To embody the plight of the common worker and  traditional communities crushed by the oligarchy; to provide a ground-level perspective on life in Lickskillet and the consequences  of the world's core economic system; to serve as a potential moral compass, reluctant informant, or catalyst for a protagonist  interacting with the injustices of Primal Mama. His victimhood is a direct result of the world's established Deontic ( oligarchy power) and Alethic (GE gator dominance) modalities.]`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle ):** `[The daily struggle to maintain dignity and provide for his granddaughter versus the soul-crushing nature of his labor and  the constant reminders of what has been lost; The desire for justice or even revenge against the faceless oligarchy versus the practical impotence  of his position and fear of reprisal; The internal battle to preserve ancestral memory and identity in a world that actively de values and erases it.]`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `[Could be radical ized by a specific event or charismatic figure; might find an unexpected way to use his "obsolete" traditional knowledge against  the oligarchy or to help others survive; could be pushed to a breaking point leading to open defiance or a desperate act ; might form an unlikely alliance (e.g., with an Erpenthrope also wary of the oligarchies, or a  sympathetic outsider). His knowledge of old swamp ways could become crucial if the GE-systems falter.]`
