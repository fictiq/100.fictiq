## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama  heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them ** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition **.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating  multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally  left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character' s being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence within the Primal Mama setting.*
    *   `- Appearance_ General: [Human male, early 40s, meticulously maintained physique that suggests regular, controlled exercise rather than physical labor . Carries himself with an air of urban sophistication that seems slightly out of place in swampier environs.]` # Auth : [Primal Mama Visual Guide Concept]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Sharp, analytical features;  eyes are a cool, assessing grey. Hair is perfectly coiffed in a somewhat feathered, yet conservative, late 1 970s style. Fingernails are always clean.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Visual Guide Concept]
     *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [None visible; prides himself on an unblemished, "civilized" presentation .]` # Auth: [Character Concept]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Impeccably tailored  leisure suits or diplomatic ensembles in muted earth tones (ochre, olive, brown) made from high-quality synthetic fabrics  – all strictly adhering to late 1970s Beetriot elite fashion. Polished, low-heeled dress  shoes (often impractical for muddy terrain). Occasionally wears a wide-lapeled, weather-resistant trench coat when traveling  by watercraft.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic Constraint / Visual Guide]
    *    `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Cultivated, smooth baritone. Speaks with precise diction and carefully chosen words, often  with a slight air of condescension or patient explanation, especially when addressing those he perceives as less sophisticated. Avoids slang or  regional dialects.]` # Auth: [Character Concept Dialogue Notes]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms:  [Controlled, deliberate movements. Tends to stand stiffly in less "orderly" environments. Subtle habit of adjusting  his cuffs or smoothing his lapels. Uses a datapad with a chunky, wood-paneled casing and analog- style readouts.]` # Auth: [Character Concept / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic Constraint]
    *    `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Faint, lingering scent of an expensive, somewhat musky 1 970s-style cologne and the slightly sterile smell of Beetriot's filtered air systems.]` # Auth : [Sensory Palette - Beetriot vs. Swamp]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [ Exact height/weight, specific brand of cologne, preference for tea or coffee (though likely something refined and imported to Beet riot, if available).]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**

    *    `- Limitation (Social): [Struggles to connect authentically with non-Beetriot citizens. His adherence to formality  can be perceived as arrogance or untrustworthiness.

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle .*

*   **Core Essence:** `Ambassador Sterling Thorne is constituted as the quintessential Beetriot elite: a man  whose identity is inextricably linked to the city's artificial order, its mandated 1970s retro-futuristic aesthetic , its reliance on solar power and GE alligators, and its rigid social hierarchies. He is a product of a system  that values surface and control over substance and authenticity, where cattle are art and their consumption an unthinkable horror. His entire being reflects  Beetriot's attempt to impose a specific, controlled reality onto the chaotic aftermath of the Biological Calamity.`
*   ** Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as an embodiment of Beetriot's culture, power, and worldview when interacting with the " outer" territories like Lickskillet. He can act as an antagonist, a source of conflict due to cultural misunderstandings or  policy enforcement, a vehicle for exposition about Beetriot, or potentially a character whose rigid beliefs are challenged by the realities of the swamp  and its denizens (Erpenthropes, Witches, the resilience of mom-and-pop operations). He  highlights the socio-economic friction caused by entities like the meat oligarchy, for whom he might be an unwitting (or w itting) agent.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The core conflict lies between Thorne' s ingrained Beetriot exceptionalism/fastidiousness and the unavoidable grit, danger, and alien logic of the Primal Mama sw amplands. This manifests as:
    *   Adherence to protocol vs. the need for unorthodox solutions in the swamp .
    *   Belief in Beetriot's "truth" vs. contradictory evidence encountered outside.
    *    Personal ambition vs. the genuine (and perhaps unpleasant) demands of his mission.
    *   Disdain for Autom aton/LLM users vs. potential situations where such tools might be (perversely) useful but reputationally disastrous .`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Thorne's authenticated properties allow for several  development paths:
    *   He could become more entrenched in his Beetriot views, becoming a more rigid antagonist.
     *   He might develop a grudging respect for certain aspects of swamp life or certain individuals, leading to a slight moderation  of his elitism (Social/Psychological change).
    *   A direct, undeniable encounter with the supernatural (Er penthropes, potent magic) could shatter or reshape his Epistemic framework.
    *   Failure in his mission could  lead to disgrace in Beetriot (Social/Axiological change), potentially forcing him into an unwelcome alliance or exile.
    *    He might be forced to confront the "truth" sought by Erpenthropes, challenging his understanding of the  Calamity or Beetriot's foundations (Epistemic/Psychological shift).`
