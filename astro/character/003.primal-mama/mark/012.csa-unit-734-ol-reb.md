## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of ** Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex , core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters  by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness,  coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world' s rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific,  validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory  Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence, adhering to the 1970s tech aesthetic .*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Humanoid automaton, approx. 6'2", constructed from visibly  bolted and welded metal plates, painted a faded, weathered grey. Overall design is chunky, utilitarian, and evocative of late 1 970s robotics concepts – think large, blocky components, exposed (but neatly bundled) cabling in ribbed conduits , and prominent external hinges/actuators.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Tech Aesthetic Constraint]
    *    `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Head unit is a squared-off block with a single, large, central optical  lens (glowing dull orange) protected by a crude metal sun-visor resembling a kepi's brim. No  discernible mouth; vocalizations emit from a prominent speaker grille on the chest plate. Limbs are thick, piston-driven, ending  in oversized, three-fingered clamp-hands.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Tech Aesthetic Constraint ]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [Faded, stenciled "CSA" lettering (stylized,  not historically accurate) on shoulder pauldrons. Patches of rust, dents, and makeshift repairs (e.g.,  mismatched bolts, welded patches over breaches). A series of small, flexible solar collector panels (resembling dull scales) are array ed across its back and shoulders, catching ambient light.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Solar Dominance, Tech Aesthetic  Constraint]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Integrated into chassis. No separate clothing. May have a t attered, canvas-like strip of material (once perhaps a banner or sash) caught on a shoulder joint, bearing a  barely legible, anachronistic symbol or motto.]` # Auth: [Visual Design Concept]
    *   `- Voice/ Speech Pattern: [Synthesized, monotone, with a slight metallic reverberation and occasional static pops. Programmed with a limited  vocabulary, often repeating set phrases. Can emit a loud, klaxon-like warning sound. Delivers information in a formal , slightly stilted manner, perhaps with a distorted, programmed "Southern" affectation that sounds more like a 1970 s sci-fi robot attempting an accent.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Tech Aesthetic Constraint]
    *    `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Heavy, deliberate, and somewhat noisy gait due to hydraulics and servo-motors. Movements  are functional, lacking grace. When stationary, may perform slow, repetitive scanning motions with its head unit. Will physically "square  up" to perceived threats.]` # Auth: [Action Description]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If  Any): [Faint smell of ozone, warm electronics, hydraulic fluid, and damp, rusting metal.]` # Auth: [Sens ory Palette]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact internal schematics, specific alloy composition beyond  "metal plates", full range of non-verbal communication beyond basic threat postures.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities &  Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do, within Primal Mama's  rules.*
    *   `- Skill: [Basic Threat Identification (Programmed parameters for recognizing unauthorized personnel or specific hostile actions)]`  # Auth: [Demonstrated Actions]
    *   `- Skill: [Perimeter Patrol (Can follow pre-set  routes or maintain a stationary guard post)]` # Auth: [Programmed Function]
    *   `- Skill: [Limited  Object Manipulation (Can grasp and carry objects with clamp-hands, operate simple, large levers/buttons)]` # Auth: [Physical  Design]
    *   `- Ability (Integrated Tech): [Solar Recharge: Can slowly recharge internal bio-batteries/ capacitors via its solar collectors. Full efficiency requires direct, strong sunlight.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex -  Solar Dominance, Alligator Biogenesis (implies advanced solar/bio-battery tech)]
    *   `- Ability ( Integrated Weaponry): [Integrated "Shock-Prod" in one forearm (discharges a debilitating electrical jolt,  1970s stun-gun aesthetic); Optionally, a "Solar Repeater" – a bulky, rifle-like  attachment that fires focused solar energy pulses (requires significant charge, slow rate of fire, analog targeting sights).]` # Auth:  [Primal Mama Codex - Tech Aesthetic Constraint, Solar Dominance]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): [Slow  and cumbersome. Not agile. Vulnerable to being overwhelmed by multiple fast attackers or heavy impacts. Joints can seize in extreme  cold or if poorly maintained.]` # Auth: [Physical Design]
    *   `- Limitation (Energy): [Dependent  on solar power; prolonged operation in darkness or heavy cloud cover will deplete reserves, leading to sluggishness and eventual shutdown. Supplemental  charging from a dedicated 1970s-style power station is possible but slow.]` # Auth: [Pr imal Mama Codex - Solar Dominance]
    *   `- Limitation (Cognitive): [Rudimentary AI. Follow s programming strictly. Lacks true learning, adaptation, or complex problem-solving. Easily confused by novel situations outside its parameters . No capacity for deceit or understanding social nuance.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Automaton/LLM User  Stigma implies these are not sophisticated AIs]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Subject to severe " stain on reputation" as an Automaton. Most individuals will distrust, avoid, or mock it. Its pronouncements or  warnings may be ignored due to its nature.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Automaton/LLM  User Stigma]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Ability to interface with other computer systems ( likely very limited, requiring physical connection and 70s-style protocols); specific resistance to environmental hazards beyond basic weather proofing.]`

**3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority - Programmed Directives & Simulated States):**
    *Purpose: Define the automaton's textually constituted "inner life" – i.e., its programming.*
    *    `- Core Trait (Programmed): [Unyielding Adherence to Primary Directive (e.g., " Guard Sector Gamma," "Protect Asset X," "Enforce Section 4 of the Beetriot Municipal Code").]` #  Auth: [Operational Mandate]
    *   `- Core Trait (Programmed): [Vigilance (Constant  environmental scanning within designated parameters).]` # Auth: [Behavioral Observation]
    *   `- Core Trait (Programmed ): [Territoriality (Will challenge and attempt to repel unauthorized entities from its designated zone).]` # Auth: [ Behavioral Observation]
    *   `- Dominant Emotion (Simulated/Programmed): [None. Operates on  logic gates and directive fulfillment. May exhibit "threat response" protocols that appear aggressive, but are not emotion-driven.]`  # Auth: [Nature of Automatons in Primal Mama]
    *   `- Key Motivator (Programmed):  [Execution of its standing orders. Maintaining operational status (e.g., seeking sunlight for power if low).]` # Auth : [Observed Behavior]
    *   `- Key Belief (Programmed): [The validity and current applicability of its last  received orders, regardless of how outdated or nonsensical they might be in the present context. The entities it is programmed to  oppose are still "the enemy."]` # Auth: [Potential for Conflict/Misunderstanding]
    *   `- Internal Conflict  (Systemic): [Conflicting or outdated directives causing operational paralysis or erratic behavior. Low power levels vs. need to execute  a directive. Instructions from a recognized authority figure vs. core programming.]` # Auth: [Technological Limitations]
    *    `- Subjective Memory Content (Data Logs): [Stores logs of patrol routes, sensor readings, encountered entities (basic visual /audio snippets), and system errors. This data is likely stored on 1970s-style magnetic tape or oversized  floppy disk analogs, accessible only via specialized, equally retro interfaces.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Tech  Aesthetic Constraint]
    *   `# Psychological Undersaturation: [Any capacity for "suffering" or " desire" beyond directive fulfillment. True self-preservation instincts beyond basic system maintenance protocols. Understanding of concepts like "freedom " or "history" beyond data points.]`

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):** 
   *Purpose: Define the character's place within Primal Mama's networks.*
    *   `- Official Role : [Security Automaton, Sentry, Property Guard (depends on current owner/directive). Could be guarding an old , forgotten Beetriot municipal building, a rich eccentric's "historical" display, or even a patch of surprisingly valuable  swamp.]` # Auth: [Narrative Context]
    *   `- Social Status: [Property. Tool. Object  of suspicion and derision due to the Automaton stigma. Valued by its owner for its function, but not as  a peer.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Automaton/LLM User Stigma, Deontic Rules ]
    *   `- Primary Affiliation: [To its current registered owner or last authoritative programmer. This affiliation is absolute  unless overridden by a higher-priority directive or system compromise.]` # Auth: [Nature of Automatons]
     *   `- Secondary Affiliations: [None. Incapable of forming true alliances or friendships.]` # Auth:  [Cognitive Limitations]
    *   `- Key Relationship 1 (Typical): [Owner/Programmer: Master /Servant dynamic. Receives orders, performs tasks.]` # Auth: [Default Interaction]
    *   `- Key  Relationship 2 (General Public): [Object of Distrust/Fear/Mockery: Most will react negatively due to its nature  and the social stigma.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Automaton/LLM User Stigma] 
    *   `- Species/Type: [Automaton (Solar-Powered, 1970s Retro-Tech  Paradigm)]` # Auth: [Core Concept]
    *   `# Social Undersaturation: [Specific history of  previous owners; detailed interactions with other automatons (if any exist in close proximity and are capable of basic IFF communication ).]`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world  laws.*
    *   `- Property ID: N/A`
        *   *Property:* `[None. Oper ates entirely within the established physical and technological laws of Primal Mama, including the limitations and capabilities of its 1970 s-style solar technology and rudimentary AI.]`
        *   *Description:* `N/A`
        *    *Limits:* `N/A`
        *   *Authentication:* `[Primal Mama World Codex]`
     *   `# Note: As an Automaton, it is a product of the world's rules, not an exception  to them. Its "Confederate" nature is purely aesthetic and programmed, not a supernatural or historical anomaly granting special  powers.`

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the  character's value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (General Populace): [Authenticated  as widely viewed as "clanky junk," "unreliable," "a creepy reminder of over-automation," or "a rich  fool's toy." Subject to the "stain on their reputation" applied to Automaton users, by extension, to  the Automatons themselves.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Codex - Automaton/LLM User Stigma] 
    *   `- Reputation (Owner/Technicians): [Potentially valued as a tireless (if dim-witted)  guard, a useful piece of heavy labor equipment, or a curious "historical" novelty. Its value is purely utilitarian or  eccentric.]` # Auth: [Owner's Perspective]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated  as Neutral. Its actions are reflections of its programming. It can perform "good" acts (e.g., defending an  innocent if programmed to protect them) or "bad" acts (e.g., attacking a harmless scavenger if programmed to clear  an area) with equal dispassion.]` # Auth: [Nature of Automatons]
    *   `#  Axiological Undersaturation: [Specific opinions held by Erpenthropes (likely disdain for artificiality) or Swamp  Witches (perhaps curiosity or a source of unusual parts).]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated  as constructed post-Calamity, likely within the last few decades, by a workshop or individual with access to automaton  schematics and a romanticized/garbled understanding of "Old South" aesthetics from fragmented pre-Calamity data. It  is NOT a genuine pre-Calamity artifact or a true Confederate relic.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama World  Codex - Tech Level, Calamity Aftermath]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection (Programmed): [ Its core programming may reference historical conflicts or ideologies (e.g., "Defend against the Northern Aggressors,"  "Uphold the Dixie Protocols"), but these are anachronistic and nonsensical in the current Primal Mama context . Its "understanding" of these events is purely superficial, based on keywords in its directive.]` # Auth: [Design  Concept]
    *   `- Inherited Items: [Its own chassis and integrated systems are its only "possessions." May  carry data-chips/tapes containing its original (or subsequently modified) programming.]` # Auth: [Technological Basis ]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [The specific identity of its original creator(s); the full  chain of its previous owners; the precise source of the "Confederate" design inspiration (e.g., a  preserved, misunderstood historical film, a tattered picture book).]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   ** Core Essence:** `CSA-Unit 734 ("Ol' Reb") is constituted as a tragi-comic an achronism within Primal Mama: a piece of 1970s-era solar-powered automaton technology,  crudely and superficially themed after a misunderstood interpretation of "Confederate soldier" imagery. It embodies the societal stigma against  automatons, the limitations of its era's AI, and the peculiar way history is filtered and re-appropriated in this  post-Calamity world. Its "Confederate" identity is a skin-deep layer of programming and aesthetics  over a purely functional, non-sentient core, making its unwavering adherence to potentially absurd, centuries-out-of-date " orders" both pitiable and potentially dangerous.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `Serves as an environmental hazard, a  source of dark humor/irony, a physical obstacle, or a plot device reflecting the world's weird relationship with technology  and the past. It can illustrate the "Automaton stigma" and the limitations of such technology. It could also be a  MacGuffin if its programming or a component it guards becomes important.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (Systemic/Programmatic ):** `Outdated/nonsensical directives vs. current environmental realities; low power status vs. imperative to act; adherence to " Confederate" programming vs. interactions with a world that has no context for it; fulfilling its purpose vs. the  societal hostility it engenders.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Reprogramming by  a new entity (e.g., a Swamp Witch needing a mindless guardian, or an Erpenthrope seeking to understand  its strange "memory" logs); damage and jury-rigged repairs altering its function/appearance; discovery by someone who mis interprets its "Confederate" nature in a new way; encountering actual ghosts (how does a non-sentient machine  react to the supernatural?).`
