## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed  definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole žel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the  **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character  Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from  the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Silas Vance is constituted as a man of deep integrity  and self-reliance, with strong African heritage, intrinsically tied to the Lickskillet swamp community and its traditions of  alligator harvesting. His existence is defined by the practical application of aging 1970s-era technology and a  profound understanding of the natural world. He is a direct victim of Primal Mama's core socio-economic conflict: the oppressive  power of the Beetriot-based meat oligarchy crushing independent, "mom-and-pop" operations. His struggle  embodies the tension between traditional, autonomous lifestyles and the encroaching, impersonal forces of a stratified, post-calamity capitalism , all filtered through the world's unique aesthetic and ecological rules.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve  as a primary example and human face of the "friction" caused by the meat processor oligarchy, as highlighted in the  Primal Mama Coherence Protocol (Deontic Modalities). His plight can illustrate the systemic injustice within Primal Mama, drive  plots involving resistance or desperation in Lickskillet, and offer a ground-level perspective on the world's economic realities , contrasting sharply with the elite of Beetriot. He can also serve to highlight the value of community and resilience in the face of  adversity.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The drive to maintain his independence and moral code  vs. the crushing economic pressure to submit or take desperate measures. His innate hope and belief in fairness vs. the encro aching despair and resentment fueled by systemic exploitation. The need to provide for himself (and any dependents) vs. the diminishing returns  and increasing risks of his profession.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Silas could be pushed  towards seeking unconventional aid (e.g., from Swamp Witches, or even appealing to an Erpenthrope if  one is revealed to have sympathies). He might become a reluctant leader of local discontent, or conversely, be broken by the pressure . His story could involve a desperate gamble, a flight from debt, or an attempt to find an alternative livelihood in a world with  limited options for someone of his skillset and aversion to stigmatized LLM/Automatons.`
