## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons ** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters ** ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They  possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authentic ating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions  within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**:  define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties  constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory  Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General : [Lean, weathered human male, indeterminate age between 40s-60s due to sun/sw amp exposure; wiry build.]` # Auth: [Narrative Description "Bayou Beatitudes"]
    *    `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Deep-set, startlingly blue eyes that seem to absorb the swamp light; le athery, tanned skin; a tangled, sun-bleached beard often adorned with small, polished alligator teeth or vertebrae.]` # Auth : [Visual Concept Art Ref# PM_Silas_001]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinct ive Marks: [A faded, stylized alligator tattoo coiling around his left forearm, done in a crude, almost tribal  style. A prominent scar on his right cheek, shaped like a crescent moon – "a kiss from Mama Gator," he claims.] ` # Auth: [Narrative Description "Bayou Beatitudes"]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [ Patched-up overalls made from durable, swamp-resistant fabric (likely synthetic, but with a natural fiber look), often  shirtless underneath or with a faded, wide-collared 1970s-style shirt. Wears a  wide-brimmed, woven swamp grass hat adorned with ethically sourced (shed) alligator scutes. Carries a repurposed  1970s amplifier casing as a satchel, powered by a small solar panel, occasionally playing garbled hymns  to Burt, Jerry, or Gram.]` # Auth: [Visual Concept Art Ref# PM_Silas_00 1, Prop Design Doc PM_Tech_078]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [ A resonant, surprisingly gentle baritone with a thick, bayou drawl. Speaks slowly, often in parables drawn  from alligator behavior, solar cycles, and imagined dialogues between the Deified Trio. Prone to sudden, fervent exclamations of  "Praise the Sun-Snout!" or "By Burt's Blessed 'Stache!"]` # Auth : [Dialogue Snippets "Bayou Beatitudes"]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Moves  with a slow, deliberate pace, equally comfortable on treacherous swamp ground or a flatboat. Has a habit of staring intently  at the sun or the water for long periods, humming softly. Often whittles small alligator figures from driftwood.]` # Auth : [Action Description "Bayou Beatitudes"]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Sw amp mud, sun-baked algae, a faint hint of alligator musk, and ozone from his jury-rigged solar  tech.]` # Auth: [Sensory Palette Doc - Primal Mama]
    *   `# Physical Und ersaturation: [Exact height/weight, dental records, specific origins of all patches on clothing.]`

**2.  Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.* 
    *   `- Skill: [Expert Swamp Navigator (by foot, flatboat, or recognizing gator trails)]`  # Auth: [Demonstrated Actions "Bayou Beatitudes" Ch. 2]

    *   `- Skill:  [Rudimentary Solar Tech Scavenging & Repair (enough to keep his 1970s-aesthetic gear functional , e.g., his "holy amp-satchel")]` # Auth: [Narrative Description of him tinkering] 
    *   `- Skill: [Charismatic/Persuasive Oratory (can captivate small groups of swamp folk  with his unique interpretations of "God's Plan" via the Deified Trio and gator-symbolism)]` #  Auth: [Dialogue "Bayou Beatitudes" Ch. 3]
    *   `- Skill: [For aging and basic swamp survival skills (finding edible grubs, water, shelter)]` # Auth: [Demonstrated Actions]

    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Larg ely ignorant of Beetriot politics, advanced GE science (beyond awe at its results), and the intricacies of the meat olig archy's operations. His knowledge of the Deified Trio is filtered through apocryphal swamp tales and personal revelation , not "official" doctrine (if any exists). Distrusts/disdains Automatons and LLMs.]`  # Auth: [Dialogue, Internal Monologue hints]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Seen as an eccentric  at best, a blasphemer by more orthodox "believers" (if any exist), or a harmless madman by prag matists. Holds no official position or power.]` # Auth: [Character Interactions "Bayou Beatitudes"]
     *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Ability to swim long distances; literacy level (likely basic); knowledge of specific ghost  rituals (likely none, relies on intuition/awe).]`

    *   `- Dominant Emotion: [ Awed Reverence / Earnest Seeking]` # Auth: [Narrator Descriptions, Expressed Dialogue]
    *    `- Key Motivator: [To understand and share the "Truth of the Sun-Snout Cycle" – his  syncretic belief system that connects solar power, alligator life-cycles, and the virtues of Reynolds, Reed, and  Parsons. To "Find God" by finding the purest expression of this cycle.]` # Auth: [Explicit Statements " Bayou Beatitudes" Ch. 1]
    *   `- Key Belief: [The Deified Trio were  prophets of a simpler, more authentic way of life, whose wisdom is now reflected in the resilience of the solar-powered all igators and the enduring spirit of the swamp. Believes cattle are "false idols" representing a decadent, forbidden past.] ` # Auth: [Sermons, Dialogue]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [His intuitive faith vs . the indifference or hostility of the world; the beauty he sees vs. the brutality of the swamp and human greed; reconciling  the "good ol' boy" charm of his deities with the profound spiritual truths he ascribes to them.]` # Auth:  [Internal Monologue, Reactions to challenges]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Vivid "visions" he  interprets as messages from the Deities or the "Primal Gator Spirit," often involving sunlight, water, and the imagined  "sacred geometry" of alligator scales.]` # Auth: [Narrative Depiction of his "trances"]
     *   `# Psychological Undersaturation: [Specific childhood experiences leading to his faith; opinions on vampire bunnies (likely  sees them as another strange facet of Mama's will); detailed understanding of the "invisible women" conspiracy (likely dismiss es it as a distraction from true spiritual concerns).]`

    *   `- Primary Aff iliation: [None formal. Considers himself affiliated with "All Creation under the Solar Trinity."]` # Auth: [Self-description ]
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: [May have fleeting, respectful interactions with isolated Erpenthropes, seeing  them as fellow (though perhaps misguided) seekers of a deeper truth. Wary of Swamp Witches, whose magic feels  "too earthy, not enough sun."]` # Auth: [Potential Narrative Beats]

        *   *Description:* `[Operates fully under general world rules. His perceived spiritual insights are a product  of his unique psychological makeup and deep immersion in his belief system.]`
        *   *Limits:* `[Cannot  command alligators, see actual ghosts (beyond common perception if any), or perform magic.]`
        *   *Authentication:*  `[Consistent portrayal as devoutly believing but not supernaturally empowered, per Primal Mama Coherence Protocol stating ghosts  require ritual magic he doesn't possess.]`

    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet Populace): [Generally  dismissed as a 'swamp crazy,' 'gator-botherer,' or 'religious nut.' May be a source of amusement  or mild annoyance.]` # Auth: [Implied through setting descriptions]
    *   `- Reputation (Meat Olig archy/Beetriot Elite if encountered): [Would be viewed as utterly irrelevant, possibly a dangerous subversive if his anti -cattle rhetoric gained traction (unlikely).]` # Auth: [Logical extension of world's power dynamics]
     *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via narrative focus as fundamentally sincere, well-intentioned, and seeking  a form of purity/truth, even if his path is eccentric.

    *   `# Axiological Und ersaturation: [Reputation among Erpenthropes (curiosity? disdain?); specific Swamp Witch opinions.] `

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's known origins  and connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as originating from a now-defunct, isolated  fishing camp deep in the Atchafalaya Basin remnant.

    *   `- Key Past Event Connection (Subjective): [ Claims his "Calling" came during a "Great Solar Flare over the Saurian Sanctuary," where he "conversed with  Burt's laughter on the sunbeams and Jerry's wisdom in the gator's growl." This is  a personal, uncorroborated mystical experience.]` # Auth: [His own testimony]
    *    `- Inherited Items:** [His grandfather's cracked aviator sunglasses (1970s style), which he treats  as a holy relic, believing they "filter out the false world, show the God-Light."]` # Auth:  [Narrative inventory]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Details of his life before his "Calling "; specific family members; precise nature of the traumatic event that spurred his transformation.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.* 

*   **Core Essence:** `Brother Silas is constituted as a sincere, albeit eccentric, spiritual seeker in Primal Mama , attempting to synthesize a coherent faith from the disparate elements of his world: the deified celebrity trinity, the life-giving  power of the sun and GE alligators, and the raw, often brutal, beauty of the swamp. He is a man  whose Psychological properties (deep faith, reverence for nature) drive his Functional actions (preaching, swamp wandering) and define his Social  position (outsider mystic). His value system (Axiological) is a direct rejection of the cattle-artifact taboo and the urban  elite, finding divinity in the very things that sustain the common folk, framed by the 1970s aesthetic he views  as inherently more "authentic" or "blessed."`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To act as a voice of  alternative spirituality and a living embodiment of the world's unique cultural miasma. He can serve as a moral compass ( however skewed), a source of unexpected wisdom or local knowledge, a foil to more cynical or materialistic characters, or a catalyst for exploring  the world's deeper themes of faith, adaptation, and the search for meaning in a bizarre reality. He represents one  way individuals "find God" in Primal Mama.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The  tension between his profound, personal faith and the skepticism/indifference of others. The challenge of reconciling the often-violent  "natural law" of the swamp (and its gators) with his perception of a benevolent divine plan. His desire  for a "purer" spiritual connection versus the materialistic interpretations of the Deified Trio that might exist elsewhere.`
*   ** Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could gain a small, genuine following, forcing him into a leadership role. Might  encounter an Erpenthrope or Swamp Witch who challenges or expands his understanding of "truth" and the supernatural. His  quest for "God" could lead him to uncover fragments of pre-calamity history or forgotten lore that recontext ualize his faith. He might be forced to confront the "death by burger" rule or the oligarchy in a way  that tests his pacifist nature.`
