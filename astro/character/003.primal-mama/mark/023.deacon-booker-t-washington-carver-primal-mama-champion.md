## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed  definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following  Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the  **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature  and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Deacon Booker T. Washington Carver is constituted as the resilient heart and voice of Primal Mama's  common folk, specifically those in Lickskillet struggling against the dehumanizing pressures of the meat oligarchy. His identity  is forged from a deep connection to his community, the practical realities of alligator farming (embracing the 1970s  tech aesthetic as a mark of skilled human endeavor), and a profound, lived spirituality centered on the Deified Trio's perceived  virtues of independence and defiance. He is a man whose Physical strength, Functional capabilities (oratory, gator lore), and Psychological  fortitude (principled, empathetic) are all directed towards his Social role as a protector and leader. His rejection of Automat ons/LLMs is not just cultural stigma but an axiological stance on the value of human work and community.]` 
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a primary protagonist or major supporting protagonist representing the "people' s struggle" against systemic oppression (the meat oligarchy). He embodies the positive values of community, self-reliance, and adaptation  within Primal Mama's unique constraints. He can drive plots related to social justice, economic warfare, and the preservation  of cultural identity.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The constant pressure of leading a vulnerable  community against a powerful foe. The moral dilemma of when peaceful resistance must give way to more direct confrontation. Balancing his hope  for the future with the often grim realities of the present. His respect for tradition (including the cattle taboo) clashing with the olig archy's attempts to redefine or exploit all resources.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Forg ing wider alliances (perhaps even with distrusted Erpenthropes or sympathetic Beetriot outsiders). Being forced to make  increasingly difficult choices that test his principles. Inspiring a larger-scale movement or, conversely, facing devastating setbacks that challenge  his resilience. His relationship with the Deified Trio's lore could deepen, finding new interpretations relevant to his struggle.`
