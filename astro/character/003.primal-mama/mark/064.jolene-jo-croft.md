# Based on Doležel's Heter ocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Text ually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

    *   `-  Typical Attire: [Worn but clean denim overalls or tough canvas trousers, often patched. Flannel or simple cotton work  shirts with a 1970s cut.

    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Efficient, economical movements. Walks with a purpose. Habit of squint ing against the sun, even indoors. Often wipes hands on her trousers. When listening intently, she tilts her head slightly,  like a predator assessing prey.]` # Auth: [Narrative Action Concept]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity,  internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Jolene  "Jo" Croft is constituted as the resilient, pragmatic heart of Lickskillet's dwindling independent spirit. Her existence  is a constant negotiation between the harsh realities of the Primal Mama swamp, the crushing economic pressure of the Meat Oligarchy, and  the ingrained 1970s technological and cultural aesthetics of her world. She is defined by her Functional capabilities (gator farming /processing, skiff handling) and her Psychological determination, rooted in her Historical inheritance (family business, Lickskillet upbringing ) and Axiological standing as a symbol of local grit. Her primary conflict stems from her Social/Economic position as a  small operator versus a powerful, exploitative system.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `Can serve as a protagonist embodying  the struggle for survival and dignity in Primal Mama's underclass. Alternatively, a key viewpoint character providing an authentic window  into Lickskillet life, grounding the more bizarre elements of the world. Her actions (or inactions) can  trigger or react to larger plot movements involving the Oligarchy, resource scarcity, or even encounters with the stranger facets of the  swamp (Witches, Erpenthropes, fallout from GE gator escapes).`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts  (From Bundle):** `The will to maintain independence vs. the pragmatic need for survival (which might mean compromising with the Olig archy). Loyalty to traditional Lickskillet methods vs. the temptation/necessity of risky innovation. Hope for a better future  vs. the ingrained cynicism born of experience. Personal safety vs. defending her livelihood/community.`
*   **Potential for Development ( Based on Bundle):** `Jolene could be pushed to: organize other small operators (Social change); uncover a dangerous  secret about the Oligarchy's practices or the GE gators (Epistemic change); be forced into an uneasy alliance with  an Erpenthrope or even a sympathetic Beetriot outcast (Relational change); or adapt her 1970 s tech in an ingenious, unexpected way to gain an edge (Functional/Axiological change – ingenuity is valued). She  might also be forced to confront the limits of her knowledge regarding the supernatural elements of her world.`
