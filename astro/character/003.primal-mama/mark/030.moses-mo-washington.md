# Based  on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character' s being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Male with  distinct African features, appears late 40s but aged by hardship. Stocky, once powerful frame now carries a  noticeable weariness. Skin dark, weathered from sun and swamp.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `-  Appearance_Specific Features: [Deep-set, intelligent brown eyes that hold a profound sadness and a flicker of defiance. Broad  nose, full lips often pressed into a grim line. Tightly coiled salt-and-pepper hair, mostly pepper, kept short . A neatly trimmed but graying goatee.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Appearance _Distinctive Marks: [Numerous faded scars on hands and forearms from alligator handling. A more prominent, ugly scar puck ers the skin on his left shoulder, poorly healed – result of an 'enforcement action' by meat oligarchy agents . A faint, almost invisible brand-like mark on his right wrist, a relic from a brief, unjust detainment under suspicion  of cattle-related offenses.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry, Implied by Primal Mama Coherence Protocol  - Deontic (Cattle Consumption Prohibition)]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Worn, patched  canvas trousers and a faded, threadbare work shirt, colors leached by sun and swamp water – typical Lickskillet attire . Heavy, often mud-caked boots. Sometimes a battered, wide-brimmed fishing hat made of woven reeds , with a 1970s style plastic visor.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry, Primal  Mama Coherence Protocol - Axiological (1970s Aesthetic)]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern : [Deep baritone, with a gentle Louisiana bayou drawl. Speaks thoughtfully, often with pauses, words carrying weight  of experience. Rarely raises his voice, but when angered, it can take on a low, resonant growl.]` # Auth:  [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Deliberate, somewhat stiff gait due  to old injuries and lingering aches. Habit of looking over his shoulder, a lingering paranoia. Hands are calloused and strong, but  often held loosely at his sides, as if unsure what to do with them now that his primary livelihood is gone.]` # Auth:  [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Faint smell of swamp mud , alligator musk (ingrained from years of work), and sometimes the sharp tang of cheap, home-brewed chic ory coffee.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry, Implied by Primal Mama Environment]
    *   `# Physical  Undersaturation: [Exact height and weight, specific details of non-work clothing (if any), precise nature of all  minor scars.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**

Susceptible to common Lickskillet conspiracy theories,  including the "invisible women."]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry, Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Epistemic ( Conspiracy)]
    *   `- Limitation (Social/Economic): [Effectively blacklisted by the meat oligarchy.  Struggles to find consistent work. Lacks capital or resources to restart an independent operation. No access to Automaton/LLM tools , and would likely face stigma if he did, but also lacks the technical literacy.]` # Auth: [Historical Properties, Pr imal Mama Coherence Protocol - Deontic (Automaton Stigma)]

Believes in the value of honest work and self-sufficiency, now lost  to him.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Epistemic (Conspiracy); Dialogue] 
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [Desire for retribution vs. Fear of further harm to himself or the few people  he cares about; Bitterness over loss vs. Innate kindness/community spirit; Pride vs. Necessity of taking  demeaning work/charity.]` # Auth: [Implied by Profile]

Contr asted with sharp, painful memories of the oligarchy's enforcers, the forced sale, and the subsequent struggle .]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]

 **5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
     *   `- Property ID: None Authenticated.`
        *   *Property:* `N/A`

        *   *Limits:* `N/A`
         *   *Authentication:* `Absence of evidence for exceptional status; Primal Mama Coherence Protocol (most individuals  are baseline).`
    *   `# Note: Mo Washington is defined by his commonality and vulnerability within the established rules , not by exception to them.`

    *Purpose: Define the character's value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (L ickskillet General): [Authenticated as viewed as a 'good man broken by the system,' 'a walking warning,' 'someone who  knew too much or stood too tall.' Respected for his past, pitied for his present.]` # Auth:  [Implied by Social Status, Dialogue from other Lickskillet residents]
    *   `- Reputation (Meat  Oligarchy): [Authenticated as 'a closed file,' 'a minor example made,' 'no longer a threat.' His  past resistance is noted but dismissed as insignificant now.]` # Auth: [Implied by Oligarchy's power and his  current state]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via narrative focus as a fundamentally decent  man pushed to the brink by systemic cruelty and greed. His potential future actions, even if desperate or morally grey, are framed  by this victimization.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry, Narrative Intent]
    *   `# Axiological Unders aturation: [How Beetriot elites would view him (if they were even aware of his existence – likely as indistinguishable swamp -dweller); specific reputation among Erpenthropes or Swamp Witches should they encounter him.]`

** 7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections  to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as born and raised in the cypress swamps around what became Licksk illet. His family were among the first to successfully farm alligators independently after the Biological Calamity stabilized, before the large  oligarchies formed and consolidated power.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection:  [His family farm was forcibly bought out/seized during "The Great Bayou Consolidation" (a period of aggressive  expansion by the nascent meat oligarchies, roughly 15-20 years prior to present). Accusations of ' substandard practices' or 'unsanctioned proximity to potential cattle-remnant zones' (fabricated or exaggerated) were used  to justify the takeover. His vocal resistance led to violent intimidation, injury (the shoulder scar), and the brief detainment ( the wrist brand).] His wife, Elara, died from illness exacerbated by stress and poverty shortly after losing the farm;  his children were scattered or lost to the harsh realities of Lickskillet's underbelly.]` # Auth:  [This Codex Entry, linking to Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Deontic (Cattle laws, Oligarchy friction )]
    *   `- Inherited Items:** [Authenticated to possess a worn, 1970s-style analog  solar-powered watch (stopped), a carved wooden alligator figurine his daughter made, and his grandfather's rusty but cherished  skinning knife (too dull for practical use, purely sentimental).]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   ` # Historical Undersaturation: [Specific names of the oligarchy agents directly responsible for his family's ruin beyond Overse er Brandt; the exact fate of his children (potential plot hooks); details of his ancestors pre-Calamity.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Moses "Mo" Washington is constituted as a living  testament to the human cost of Primal Mama's brutal socio-economic landscape, particularly the unchecked power of the meat oligarch ies in Lickskillet. He is a man stripped of his livelihood, family, and dignity, yet his core  of resilience, quiet anger, and lingering pride remains. His belief in local conspiracies (like the "invisible women" influencing the  oligarchs) is an authenticated psychological coping mechanism for understanding the overwhelming and seemingly impersonal forces that crushed him. His skills,  tied to a past the world has stolen, are now largely vestigial or repurposed for mere survival.`
*   ** Primary Narrative Function:** `To embody the suffering and resilience of Primal Mama's underclass; To serve as a tangible  example of the meat oligarchy's ruthlessness; To act as a potential moral compass or catalyst for other characters who encounter  him; To provide a ground-level perspective on life in Lickskillet, contrasting with Beetriot's op ulence or the supernatural mystique of Erpenthropes/Witches.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle ):** `The burning desire for justice/retribution vs. the pragmatic fear of the Oligarchy's power and  the need to protect what little he has left (or those he cares for); The weight of memory and grief vs. the necessity of  daily survival; The ingrained pride of a self-sufficient man vs. the indignity of his current marginalized state.`
*    **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Finding a specific, actionable way to challenge the oligarchy (perhaps  through aiding a protagonist or discovering a weakness); Connecting with other victims to form a nascent resistance; Being pushed to seek aid  from unconventional sources (Swamp Witches, Erpenthropes); Finding a new sense of purpose in protecting others or preserving  some truth about the past; Succumbing further to bitterness or, conversely, finding a measure of peace/acceptance.`
