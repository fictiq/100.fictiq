## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of  **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole žel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the ** richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and  the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property  Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1.  Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *    `- Appearance_General: [e.g., Large, imposing human male, late 50s, with a fleshy  face, carefully coiffed silver hair (often suspiciously dark at the roots), and a prominent gut straining against expensive,  somewhat flashy 1970s-style suits.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Visual Style Guide, Narrative  Description]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [e.g., Small, shrewd eyes that miss little , a smile that rarely reaches them, jowly cheeks. Often seen with a slight sheen of perspiration under bright lights or  during impassioned speeches.]` # Auth: [Narrative Description]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [ e.g., A large, ostentatious signet ring featuring an alligator motif intertwined with a stylized 'B' on  his right pinky finger. A faint scar from a misjudged cigar clip on his upper lip, usually hidden by his  mustache.]` # Auth: [Visual Detail, Backstory Snippet]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [ e.g., Custom-tailored polyester suits in shades of avocado green, harvest gold, or burgundy, often with wide lap els and flared trousers. Silk shirts with bold patterns. Polished alligator-skin boots (ironically, given the source  of his city's wealth is GE gators, not wild ones typically used for leather). Always a chunky, gold-plated  digital watch (1970s LED style).]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Tech  Aesthetic, Narrative Description]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [e.g., Booming, practiced  baritone with a thick, syrupy Southern drawl that can turn sharp and menacing in private. Master of the  folksy anecdote and the rousing, empty platitude. Fond of phrases invoking "tradition," "our sacred heritage," and the  "wisdom of Primal Mama" (which he reinterprets for his own ends). Often refers to the deified celebrities in  speeches.]` # Auth: [Dialogue Direction, Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Axiological/Epistemic]
     *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [e.g., A deliberate, slightly swaggering walk. Exp ansive, theatrical gestures when speaking publicly. A habit of patting backs a little too hard, or gripping arms a little too long to  assert dominance. Enjoys ostentatious displays of consumption (e.g., fine cigars, expensive (non-cattle) foods ). Sweats noticeably when agitated or lying profusely.]` # Auth: [Action Description]
    *   `- Associated  Scent (If Any): [e.g., Expensive but slightly dated cologne, rich cigar smoke, and the faint, underlying  metallic tang of Beetriot's processed air.]` # Auth: [Sensory Palette]
    *   `# Physical  Undersaturation: [e.g., Exact height and weight (beyond 'large'), specific brand of cologne, non -public attire.]`

        *   *Limits:* `N /A`
        *   *Authentication:* `[Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Emphasis on social/political power  over supernatural for this character type.]`

Heavily influenced by propaganda.]` # Auth : [Public speeches, media control]
    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet/Swamp Dwellers): [ e.g., Authenticated as 'the Beetriot Bastard', 'King Gator', 'symbol of urban corruption and exploitation '. Deeply resented and distrusted.]` # Auth: [Narrative contrast, friction point]
    *   `- Reputation ( Erpenthropes/Truth-Seekers): [e.g., Authenticated as 'The Great Deceiver', ' Spinner of Illusions', a primary obstacle to truth and justice.]` # Auth: [Their core values vs. his actions ]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [e.g., Authenticated via actions and motivations  as 'Lawful Evil' – meticulously uses and shapes the laws and social norms of Beetriot for his own corrupt benefit  and to maintain oppressive control.]` # Auth: [Overall character portrayal]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation : [e.g., How Swamp Witches view him (likely with disdain or as irrelevant unless he directly interferes with them ). His reputation in any hypothetical 'outside world' beyond Primal Mama's immediate setting.]`

**7. Historical Properties  (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.*
    *    `- Origin: [e.g., Authenticated as rising through Beetriot's political machine over decades, initially perhaps  as a charismatic lawyer or city councilman, ruthlessly eliminating rivals and forging alliances with the burgeoning meat oligarchy. Likely pre -dates the full deification of the celebrity trio but instrumental in codifying their veneration for social cohesion and his own political gain.] ` # Auth: [Narrative Backstory Elements, Logical progression in Primal Mama timeline]
    *   `- Key Past  Event Connection: [e.g., Heavily involved in the formal legislation that cemented cattle as elite artifacts and criminalized their consumption,  spinning it as "preserving our heritage" while ensuring a controllable, alligator-dependent food supply. Oversaw the "Great Beetriot Beaut ification Project" which strictly enforced the 1970s tech aesthetic across all new construction and public works, ostensibly  for "civic pride" but actually to stifle unapproved innovation and maintain a familiar, controllable environment.]` # Auth: [Pr imal Mama Coherence Protocol - Historical links to current state]
    *   `- Inherited Items/Positions: [e. g., The Mayorship of Beetriot itself, with all its attendant powers and resources. A vast network of political debts  and favors. Several prime cattle-artifact specimens acquired through "gifts" or dubious means.]` # Auth: [Narr ative inventory]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [e.g., Specific details of his early life before  politics, the exact nature of his first big 'break' or most ruthless early acts, any genuine mentors or early positive influences  (likely few or none remaining). The precise moment he 'sold his soul' to the oligarchy.]`

###  Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from  the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Mayor Rex "Kingfish" Beauregard is constituted  as the personification of Beetriot's decadent, controlled, and corrupt power structure. He is a charismatic demagogue who  masterfully manipulates Primal Mama's unique cultural fabric—the cattle taboo, the 1970s  aesthetic, the deified celebrities, and the alligator-based economy—to maintain his iron grip on the city and enrich himself and his  oligarchic allies. His entire being is a performance, masking a core of narcissistic greed and paranoid ruthlessness. He represents  the societal sickness that thrives by exploiting the very laws and values it purports to uphold, particularly the Alethic impossibility /Deontic prohibition of cattle consumption and the Axiological reverence for a manufactured past.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:**  `To serve as a primary antagonist, representing systemic corruption and oppression within Beetriot. He is an obstacle to protagonists seeking  truth, justice, or freedom from the city's constraints. He embodies the oppressive side of Primal Mama's retro -futuristic, bayou-infused dystopia, particularly the "friction" caused by the meat oligarchy he enables .`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The constant effort to maintain his folksy public persona  versus his private tyrannical nature. His fear of exposure or being overthrown by rivals or popular unrest (perhaps fueled by Erpenthrope  revelations or Lickskillet defiance). His dependence on the meat oligarchy, which could turn on him if he ceases  to be useful or becomes too much of a liability. The potential for the "invisible women" conspiracy he might manipulate to spin  out of his control.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `His downfall is the most  narratively potent development. This could come through exposure of his corruption, a successful challenge by protagonists, betrayal by the oligarchy,  or the consequences of his own hubris. Minor developments could include increasing paranoia, more desperate measures to cling to power, or  even a (highly unlikely) moment of forced reflection if faced with undeniable truth or personal loss. His adherence to the 1 970s aesthetic could become a weakness if new, uncontrollable tech emerges.`
