## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed  definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole žel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the ** richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world' s rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the  heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character 's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Male, late 40s, with prominent  African features: dark mahogany skin, broad nose, full lips. Once powerfully built from physical labor, now lean to the point of ga untness, with weariness etched into his face.]` # Auth: [Visual Description]
    *   `- Appearance _Specific Features: [Deep-set, intelligent brown eyes that often hold a haunted or distrustful look. Short, tightly coiled black  hair, flecked with grey, especially at the temples. A network of fine lines around his eyes and mouth speak  of sun, worry, and lost smiles.]` # Auth: [Visual Description]
    *   `- Appearance_ Distinctive Marks: [A long, faded scar runs diagonally across his left forearm, a memento from a slip while  dressing a large bull gator in his youth. His hands are calloused and strong, though often idle now.]` # Auth:  [Visual Description, Backstory Link]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Worn, patched-up canvas trousers and  a threadbare, once-brightly colored (now faded orange) work shirt, common in Lickskillet.  Often barefoot or in crudely repaired gator-hide boots. May possess a battered, wide-brimmed hat  made of woven reeds for sun protection.]` # Auth: [World Aesthetic - Lickskillet, Socio-Economic Status ]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [A deep baritone, once resonant with laughter and confidence, now often  quiet, tinged with a lingering bitterness or resignation. Speaks with a distinct Lickskillet bayou patois. Pr one to long silences.]` # Auth: [Dialogue Direction / Regional Dialect]
    *   `- Gait /Mannerisms: [Moves with a slow, deliberate economy, a habit from years of hard work, now also  reflecting his subdued spirit. Sometimes observed staring blankly at the murky waters of the bayou or towards the distant, indifferent  glow of Beetriot.]` # Auth: [Action Description, Psychological Link]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any ): [Faint smell of swamp mud, old woodsmoke, and the metallic tang of stale alligator blood that never quite washes out of  Lickskillet air, even if he's no longer directly processing.]` # Auth: [Sensory Palette  - Lickskillet]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/weight, specific non -work clothing preferences (likely has none of significance).]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
    *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*
    *   `- Skill:  [Expert Alligator Butcher & Processor (Formerly). Knew traditional and 'modern' 1970s-aesthetic  processing techniques for maximizing meat yield and hide quality.]` # Auth: [Backstory, Historical Property]
    *    `- Skill: [Proficient Swamp Navigator (on foot and by small pirogue). Intimate knowledge of local L ickskillet bayou channels and gator behavior.]` # Auth: [Implied by Lickskillet upbringing /profession]

    *   `- Limitation (Technological): [Cannot afford or  access the high-end, oligarchy-approved 1970s-aesthetic processing machinery now likely required by stricter  (and biased) regulations. His older, perfectly functional but 'non-compliant' gear was effectively devalued.]`  # Auth: [World Tech Aesthetic + Oligarchy Friction]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: [Fire arm proficiency (likely has one, common outside Beetriot, but skill level undefined); specific knowledge of GE gator weak  points beyond general hunting.]`

    *   `- Key Belief:  [Believes the "game is rigged" by the powerful (oligarchy, perhaps even Beetriot elites indirectly). Bel ieves that traditional skills and honest labor are no longer valued or protected.]` # Auth: [Expressed opinions, World view]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [The memory of his former prosperous life and self-worth vs. the harsh  reality of his current dispossession. The desire to fight back or speak out vs. the practical fear of further retaliation from the oligarchy .]` # Auth: [Behavioral inconsistencies, Hesitations]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [ Vivid, painful memories of his family's thriving alligator processing business, the specific individuals from the oligarchy who orchestrated its  downfall (e.g., through predatory pricing, manipulation of supply from Saurian Sanctuary, or trumped-up regulation  violations regarding 1970s tech compliance). Nostalgic memories of community and a sense of purpose.]` # Auth:  [Backstory elements]
    *   `# Psychological Undersaturation: [Specific views on deified celebrities (likely  seen as distant, irrelevant to his suffering), detailed opinions on Erpenthropes or Swamp Witches (likely regarded  with general swamp-dweller caution/respect but not central to his personal crisis).

     *   `- Key Relationship 2: [To Other Lickskillet Residents: Variable. Some pity, some  fear association due to oligarchy's reach, some share his resentment.]` # Auth: [Implied social dynamics of  Lickskillet]

     *   `- Property ID: N/A`
        *   *Property:* `None authenticated.`
        *    *Description:* `Deacon Moreau operates fully under the general alethic, deontic, axiological, and epist emic rules of Primal Mama. His suffering is a direct result of the application of those rules and power dynamics by others, not due  to any unique modal status he possesses.`
        *   *Limits:* `N/A`
        *   * Authentication:* `Absence of evidence for any exceptional modal status.`
    *   `# Note: Deacon's victimhood  is powerfully illustrative *because* he is an ordinary person subject to the world's established, harsh realities, particularly its  Deontic (oligarchy power, biased regulations) and Axiological (devaluation of small craft by big business)  dimensions.`

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the  character's value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Meat Oligarchy): [ Authenticated as 'Insignificant,' 'Dealt With,' 'A minor loose end not worth further thought unless he causes trouble.' Seen  as an example to others who might resist their expansion.]` # Auth: [Implied by Oligarchy's actions /nature]
    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet General Populace): [Varies. 'Tr agic figure,' 'Victim of GatorCorp,' 'A good man beaten down,' or for some, 'Proof you  can't fight city hall (Beetriot influence/Oligarchy power).']` # Auth: [Social dynamics  of a small, oppressed community]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via narrative context  as a 'Good Man Wronged,' a symbol of the human cost of unchecked corporate power and societal disparity in Primal Mama . His potential bitterness is framed as justified by circumstance.]` # Auth: [Narrator tone, sympathetic portrayal of his plight ]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: [Reputation among Beetriot elites (utterly unknown/ irrelevant); views from Swamp Witches or Erpenthropes (likely non-existent unless he directly interacts with them). ]`

    *   `- Origin: [Authenticated as born and raised in Lickskillet.  His family, the Moreaus, had a respected, multi-generational small alligator processing business, known for quality and fair dealings.]`  # Auth: [Backstory]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection: [The 'Hostile Takeover/ Economic Sabotage' of his family business by the expanding Meat Oligarchy (circa 5-10 years prior to  'present day'). This involved predatory pricing, leveraging control over Saurian Sanctuary access to choke his supply of wild gators, and  potentially new 'safety/tech standard' regulations (tied to the 1970s aesthetic) that favored large , capitalized operations and made his established methods 'obsolete' or 'illegal'.]` # Auth: [Core of his  character's trauma, links to Deontic/Axiological rules of Primal Mama]
    *   `- Inherited  Items:** [Authenticated to possess a few well-maintained but now idle traditional alligator processing tools (e.g., a prized  skinning knife with a hand-carved bone handle, his grandfather's smoking recipes committed to memory). These are now more  mementos than tools of a trade.]` # Auth: [Narrative inventory, Symbolic Link to Past]
     *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Specific details of his ancestors beyond 'ran the family business'; his life  before the oligarchy's aggression became acute; any personal involvement with the deified celebrities' cults or major historical events pred ating his business's collapse.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize  the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:**  `Deacon Moreau is constituted as a living testament to the socio-economic brutalities of Primal Mama, specifically the " friction" caused by the meat oligarchy. His identity is forged in the loss of his family's legacy, his craft, and  his economic independence, all sacrificed to the relentless expansion of centralized power. His Functional skills (alligator processing, swamp knowledge) are now  largely negated by his Economic and Social limitations imposed by the oligarchy. His Psychological state (resentment, weariness, wounded  pride) is a direct consequence of this victimization. He represents the human face of Lickskillet's struggle against the  faceless power of entities that likely have ties to Beetriot's elite, all within the constraints of a world that demands adherence  to a specific 1970s technological aesthetic, potentially weaponized by the powerful to consolidate control.`
*    **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a poignant example of the injustices prevalent in Primal Mama; to be  a potential catalyst or source of information for protagonists seeking to understand or challenge the meat oligarchy; to ground the world' s economic and power dynamics in tangible human suffering; to highlight the vulnerability of "mom-and-pop" operations and  traditional ways of life against systemic exploitation.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Wounded Pride vs. Cr ushing Resignation; Desire for Justice/Recognition vs. Fear of Retaliation; Loyalty to Lost Traditions/Craft vs. The  Impossibility of Practicing Them; The Memory of Prosperity vs. The Daily Grind of Poverty.`
*   ** Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be galvanized into action by a new hope or opportunity (Social/ Relational change). Might share his vital knowledge (Functional/Epistemic change) with those who could use it against  the oligarchy. Could find a new, albeit smaller, purpose (Psychological change). Or, could sink further into despair , serving as a tragic warning (Psychological/Social decline). His story could involve reclaiming some small measure of dignity or  agency, even if full restoration is impossible.`
