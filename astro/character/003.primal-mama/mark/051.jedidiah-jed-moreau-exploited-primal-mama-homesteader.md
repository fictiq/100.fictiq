# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction : Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters,  significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by  the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent  psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties  across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated  bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**:  define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character  Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from  the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Jedidiah Moreau is constituted as a hardworking, resilient  family man whose traditional livelihood as a small-scale alligator farmer in Primal Mama's swamps is being systematically dismantled by the explo itative practices of the powerful Meat Oligarchy. His identity is rooted in his connection to the land, his family, and  a dying way of self-sufficient life that clashes with the retro-futuristic corporate dominance. He embodies the human cost  of the oligarchy's "friction," fighting a losing battle with 1970s-era grit against  technologically-enabled greed. His African heritage grounds him in a specific cultural lineage within the diverse bayou tapestry, adding depth  to his struggle for legacy and survival.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a primary example and  human face of the Meat Oligarchy's oppressive influence on the common folk of Lickskillet and the swamp regions. His  plight can drive subplots, motivate other characters to action (either to help him or to avoid his fate), or serve as a moral  touchstone highlighting the injustices within Primal Mama's society. He represents the tension between traditional autonomy and encroaching,  impersonal corporate power.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The need to provide for his family vs. the  crushing economic pressure from the oligarchy; His ingrained sense of pride and independence vs. the humiliating necessity of compliance or seeking  aid; The desire for justice/retribution vs. the pragmatic fear of severe repercussions for himself and his loved ones; Hope that  things might improve vs. the encroaching despair of his situation.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** ` Jed could be pushed to a breaking point, leading to desperate actions (rebellion, sabotage, seeking forbidden aid from Swamp  Witches or even Erpenthropes). He might become a reluctant leader for other victimized farmers, or his  tragedy could inspire a protagonist. Alternatively, he could succumb entirely, serving as a cautionary tale. His relationship with the ' Invisible Women' conspiracy could evolve if he seeks explanations for his suffering.`
