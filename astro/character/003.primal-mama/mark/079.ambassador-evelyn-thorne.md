## Introduction: Constituting Fict ional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle  of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being  within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose : Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: Human female, appears early  40s, meticulously maintained. Medium height, slender but with a poised, authoritative posture that belies any physical fragility.` # Auth : [Primal Mama Visual Guide Concept]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: Sharp, intelligent hazel eyes that miss  little; a patrician nose and a mouth often set in a polite, neutral smile that rarely reaches her eyes. Hair  is a dark auburn, always impeccably coiffed in a practical yet stylish (within 1970s parameters ) updo or bob.` # Auth: [Primal Mama Visual Guide Concept]
    *   `- Appearance_ Distinctive Marks: A small, almost invisible silver pin shaped like the Beetriot Citadel always worn on her lapel.  A faint, pale scar on her left forearm, poorly concealed by her sleeve – result of an early, ill-advised attempt  to pet a "tame" juvenile alligator in a Beetriot politician's menagerie.` # Auth: [Narrative  Backstory Snippet]
    *   `- Typical Attire: Impeccably tailored pant-suits or skirt -suits made of high-quality synthetic fabrics in muted jewel tones or conservative neutrals, adhering strictly to late 197 0s Beetriot fashion aesthetics (e.g., wide lapels, slightly flared trousers, chunky but elegant brooches).  Always wears practical, sturdy-heeled shoes suitable for navigating official buildings but less so for swamp mud.` # Auth: [ Primal Mama Visual Guide Concept / Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern:  Clear, modulated alto voice with precise, educated Beetriot diction. Speech is articulate, measured, and persuasive. Can affect  a warmer, more folksy tone when attempting to disarm or build rapport, though it often sounds slightly forced to discerning  swamp ears.` # Auth: [Dialogue Direction]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: Walks with a confident , purposeful stride on solid ground; more hesitant and visibly uncomfortable in swampy or uneven terrain. Has a habit of subtly  adjusting her clothing, as if perpetually brushing off unseen swamp detritus. Often carries a sleek, wood-paneled data -slate (strictly no LLM capabilities).` # Auth: [Action Description / Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic]
     *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): A faint, expensive, and slightly anachronistic floral perfume (rose  and sandalwood, perhaps a pre-calamity formula replicated with difficulty) that battles with the ambient smells of alligator,  swamp gas, and diesel from watercraft.` # Auth: [Sensory Palette]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation : Exact height/weight; specific brand of her data-slate; details of her off-duty, private attire (likely  still adhering to the aesthetic but more relaxed).`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
    *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*
    *   `- Skill:  Masterful Negotiation & Diplomacy (Core Skill, honed in Beetriot's political arenas).` # Auth: [Demonstrated Actions  in Diplomatic Scenarios]
    *   `- Skill: Proficient in Beetriot Law and Inter-Settlement Protocols .` # Auth: [Role Requirement]
    *   `- Skill: Public Speaking & Persuasion (Adept at crafting  and delivering speeches that align with Beetriot's agenda).` # Auth: [Narrative Depiction]
     *   `- Skill: Information Analysis (Can quickly process reports and identify key intelligence from approved, non-Automaton sources). ` # Auth: [Role Requirement]
    *   `- Skill: Limited Self-Defense (Basic training with a compact , solar-charged stun pistol – 1970s design, of course – for emergencies, but prefers to  avoid direct confrontation).` # Auth: [Character Background Detail]
    *   `- Limitation (Physical): Not physically  strong or agile; unsuited for prolonged exposure to harsh swamp environments or strenuous manual labor.` # Auth: [Narrative Comparisons , Physical Description]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): Superficial understanding of deep swamp ecology, Erpenthrope lore , or Swamp Witch practices beyond official Beetriot briefings (which are often biased or incomplete).` # Auth: [Dialogue  revealing misunderstandings / Coherence Protocol - Epistemic]
    *   `- Limitation (Technical): While adept with  her 1970s-style data-slate and comms, she has no practical engineering skills for GE  tech or advanced solar arrays; reliant on Beetriot technicians.` # Auth: [Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic & Solar  Dominance]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): Her Beetriot elitism and adherence to protocol can make her appear  aloof, out-of-touch, or untrustworthy to Lickskillet locals and other swamp dwellers.` # Auth: [ Interaction Descriptions]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: Ability to pilot swamp craft (unlikely); proficiency in  any specific scientific field beyond what's needed for briefings; artistic talents.`

**3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interior ity):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's textually constituted inner life.*
    *   `-  Core Trait: Ambitious (Driven to succeed within Beetriot's power structures).` # Auth: [Internal Mon ologue, Career-focused Decisions]
    *   `- Core Trait: Pragmatic / Results-Oriented ( Values efficiency and tangible outcomes over sentimentality, especially in her duties).` # Auth: [Decision-Making Patterns]
    *    `- Core Trait: Observant / Analytical (Constantly assessing situations and people for opportunities or threats to Beetriot's  interests).` # Auth: [Narrative Focus on her perceptions]

    *   `- Dominant Emotion: Controlled  Composure (Rarely displays strong outward emotion, maintaining a professional veneer). Internally, often experiences frustration with "primitive" local  customs or bureaucratic inefficiencies.` # Auth: [Narrator Descriptions, Contrast between outward/inward state]

    *   `- Key Motiv ator (Secondary/Emerging): A reluctant, growing curiosity about the resilience and strange wisdom of the swamp cultures, despite  her ingrained biases.` # Auth: [Subtle shifts in internal monologue after prolonged exposure]
    *   `- Key Belief : Beetriot represents order, progress, and the best hope for structured survival post-calamity; its dominance is ultimately  beneficial (or at least inevitable).` # Auth: [Justifications for her actions/policies]
    *   `- Key  Belief: Adherence to the 1970s Aesthetic is a sign of cultural stability and sophistication, a bul wark against the chaos of the calamity's aftermath and the 'unrefined' nature of the swamps.` # Auth:  [Internal thoughts on technology and design, Coherence Protocol - Axiological]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: Her  indoctrinated Beetriot superiority vs. the undeniable effectiveness of some swamp-dweller survival strategies. The desire for efficient information ( potentially via forbidden LLMs) vs. the severe social/legal repercussions and her own ingrained cultural aversion.` # Auth: [ Internal Monologue, Difficult Choices Depicted]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: Vivid memories of Beetriot's political  landscape, social etiquette, key figures, and the official histories of the Calamity and the rise of the celebrity deities  (viewed as cultural cornerstones).` # Auth: [Narrative Depiction]
    *   `#  Psychological Undersaturation: Deep personal fears unrelated to her career; specific childhood experiences beyond a typical privileged Beetriot upbringing;  genuine feelings about the deified celebrities (likely views them as useful cultural icons rather than true divinities).`

** 4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):**
   *Purpose: Define the character' s place within the world's networks.*
    *   `- Official Role: Accredited Ambassador from the Beetriot High Council to  the independent township of Lickskillet and liaison for outlying territories.` # Auth: [Intro Scene, Official Documents Prop ]

    *    `- Key Relationship 2: To her direct superior in Beetriot (e.g., Councillor Rexford): Formal, defer ential, focused on reporting successes and managing expectations.` # Auth: [Communication Props/Scenes]
    *   `- Key Relationship  3: To a local Lickskillet guide/aide (e.g., "Coot" or " Delta" – Fictional Examples): Transactional at first, potentially evolving into grudging respect or manipulation, depending on narrative  arc.` # Auth: [Interaction Scenes]
    *   `- Species/Type: Human (Standard Beetriot Gen otype – likely benefiting from better, more stable nutrition and healthcare access compared to some deep swamp populations).` # Auth: [Default /Description]
    *   `# Social Undersaturation: Specific family ties in Beetriot (likely influential but not  detailed); personal friendships (few, and likely politically motivated); detailed hierarchy within the Diplomatic Corps.`

**5. Modal Properties  (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
    *   ` None authenticated. Ambassador Thorne operates entirely within the established physical, biological, and social laws of Primal Mama for baseline humans .`
    *   `# Note: Her diplomatic immunity, if any, is a Deontic (legal/ social) construct, not an inherent modal property.`

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Be etriot Elite): Viewed as a competent, ambitious, and effective diplomat; a reliable instrument of Beetriot policy. Some  rivals may see her as overly cautious or too "by-the-book."` # Auth: [Dialogue from Beetriot peers /superiors]
    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet Populace): Widely seen as an outsider, " the Beetriot Suit," "She-Gator" (derogatory, implying coldness/predation), or  "Miss High-and-Mighty." Some may grudgingly respect her tenacity or see her as a necessary evil  for trade/negotiation.` # Auth: [Local character dialogue/gossip]
    *   `- Reputation (Meat  Oligarchy): A useful contact point for official channels, but also a potential obstacle if her integrity interferes with their less savory  operations. Likely attempt to cultivate or co-opt her.` # Auth: [Oligarchy character interactions]
     *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): Initially appears as an agent of a potentially exploitative urban power. Narrative  may explore the complexities of her role, offering potential for her to become a more sympathetic (or tragically flawed) figure as she confronts  the realities of Primal Mama beyond Beetriot's sanitized view.` # Auth: [Narrator tone, plot outcomes ]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: Her reputation among Erpenthropes (likely seen as just  another ephemeral human official, unless she directly impacts their hidden concerns); Swamp Witches' opinion (likely utter indifference or mild  contempt).`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character' s known origins and connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: Born in Beetriot, post-C alamity, into a family with established connections to the city's administrative bureaucracy. Educated in Beetriot's premier  (and aesthetically compliant) institutions.` # Auth: [Character Backstory Outline]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection: Played  a key role in negotiating the "Solar Array Accord" which standardized energy tariffs between Beetriot and several vital outlying solar farms , a significant but unglamorous achievement that marked her as a capable negotiator.` # Auth: [Official Record Prop  / Backstory]
    *   `- Inherited Items: Besides the citadel pin, she possesses a set of antique ( by post-calamity standards, i.e., early 1970s design) fountain pens,  a gift from her mentor, symbolizing the "art of communication."` # Auth: [Narrative inventory]
    *    `# Historical Undersaturation: Specific details of her education beyond its aesthetic compliance; her family's exact level  of influence; any significant personal tragedies or triumphs pre-dating her current posting.`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle .*

*   **Core Essence:** `Ambassador Evelyn Thorne is constituted as a product of Beetriot's ordered , aesthetically rigid, and ambitious culture, thrust into the chaotic, organically vibrant, and often contradictory reality of Primal Mama's  swamplands. Her identity is a performance of Beetriot sophistication and control, constantly challenged by the world beyond the city walls. She  embodies the tension between the "civilized" artifice of Beetriot (including its veneration of cattle-as-art  and 1970s tech) and the raw, bio-engineered nature of the alligator-dependent territories. Her adherence  to non-LLM/Automaton information systems is a core part of her operational and cultural identity.`
*   **Primary Narrative  Function:** `Serves as a key viewpoint character for exploring the political, economic, and cultural clashes between Beetriot and the swamp  territories (especially Lickskillet). Can act as a protagonist, antagonist, or complex supporting character, driving plots related  to resource negotiation, cultural misunderstanding, the influence of the Meat Oligarchy, and the enforcement/subversion of Beetriot 's laws (like the cattle consumption taboo). Her interactions can reveal the practical impact of Primal Mama's core modalities .`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Beetriot-instilled prejudice vs. observed  swamp resilience/ingenuity; personal ambition vs. ethical dilemmas posed by Beetriot's policies; the desire for effective  diplomacy vs. the "primitive" or supernatural elements she encounters (ghosts, Erpenthropes, Swamp Witch  activities); upholding the 1970s tech aesthetic and LLM-stigma vs. the practical need for efficient  information in a dangerous world.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could "go native" and develop  genuine empathy for swamp communities, potentially challenging her Beetriot loyalties. Conversely, could become more hardened and manipulative in service  of Beetriot. Might be forced to confront the supernatural elements she officially dismisses. Her relationship with the truth (especially  regarding the "invisible women" conspiracy or the real history of the Calamity) could be tested if she encounters Er penthropes or reliable ghostly testimony.`
