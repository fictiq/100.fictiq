# Based  on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

**World:**  Primal Mama
**Codex Version:** 0.2 - Character Constitution

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the  heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character 's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Human female, appears late 40s , with rich, dark brown skin. Strong, statuesque build, often carries herself with a serene intensity.]` # Auth:  [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [High cheekbones, full lips, deeply  set, perceptive dark eyes that seem to absorb light. Her tightly coiled hair is often bound in colorful wraps or adorned with small , polished alligator teeth, unusual swamp-plant seeds, and intricately woven copper wire.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
     *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [A faint, intricate scar pattern around her left wrist, resembling circuit  traces overlaid with older, ritualistic markings. Hands are calloused but nimble, often stained with plant matter or metallic dust .]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Typical Attire: [Practical, dark-colored jumpsuits  or sturdy canvas separates (1970s utilitarian chic) often modified with extra pockets and loops for tools. W ears a heavily customized tool belt featuring pouches for samples, small analog diagnostic devices (with flickering readouts and chunky dials), and ritual  components. Over this, she sometimes drapes a shawl woven with patterns reminiscent of both circuit boards and traditional African textile motifs.] ` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - 1970s Aesthetic Constraint ]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [A resonant contralto voice, typically calm and measured, even when discussing  profound or unsettling concepts. Her speech is precise, sometimes borrowing terminology from both spiritual practices and archaic technical manuals. Carries a faint,  melodious lilt.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms:  [Deliberate, observant movements. Often pauses mid-sentence to listen intently, as if to sounds others cannot hear. Has  a habit of gently touching her temple or wrist-scar when deep in thought or sensing something unusual.]` # Auth:  [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [A complex blend of swamp incense  (e.g., dried bayou herbs, burnt sage), ozone from her equipment, and a faint metallic tang.] ` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/ weight, specific details of non-functional attire preferences, typical diet.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations ):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*
    *    `- Skill: [Proficient in Ritual Magic (Ghost Interaction): Has studied and adapted known rituals, developing unique variations to try  and contact or perceive entities beyond common ghosts, seeking what she terms 'Primary Echoes' or 'Source Vibrations'.]`  # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Spectral Interaction]
    *   `- Skill:  [Esoteric Bio-Acoustics & Resonance Tuning: Constructs and uses custom-built 1970 s-style analog devices (oscilloscopes with amber screens, signal generators with heavy knobs, geiger-counter-like ' numen-detectors') to try and measure, record, and interact with spiritual or unusual energy signatures. Believes " God" or the "Primal Source" has a detectable resonant frequency.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Pr imal Mama Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic Constraint, Solar Dominance implying understanding of energy]
    *   `- Skill: [ Swamp Herbalism & Psychotropic Distillation (Rudimentary): Can identify and prepare certain swamp plants for ritual use or to  create mild psychoactive compounds intended to heighten spiritual sensitivity. Avoids Swamp Witch "Vampire Bunny" related materials as  "too chaotically imprinted."]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Swamp Witch Lore ]
    *   `- Skill: [Deep Listening & Environmental Attunement: Highly developed ability to discern subtle environmental cues,  patterns in animal behavior, or anomalous silences, which she interprets as signs or 'data'.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry ]
    *   `- Ability (Unique/Learned): [Heightened Sensitivity to Numinous Presences: Through  her experiments and self-developed techniques, she can perceive subtle shifts in spiritual ambiance, often experiencing them as auditory hallucinations ( faint choirs, static whispers, deep hums) or visual distortions at the periphery of her vision. This is not  as innate or powerful as an Erpenthrope's abilities but is beyond baseline human.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry ]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Lacks formal training in advanced genetic engineering or solar energy science ( beyond what's publicly known or inferable). Her "scientific" methods for spiritual investigation are highly unorthodox and self-taught, often  blending folk magic with repurposed analog tech.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol -  Technical Knowledge Specialization]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Viewed as an eccentric, potentially heretical figure  by followers of the Deified Celebrities. Operates outside established power structures (e.g., meat oligarchy, Beet riot elite) and has limited material resources.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - De ified Celebrities, Axiological Values]
    *   `- Limitation (Technological): [Bound by the 1970 s aesthetic and general tech level; her experimental devices are prone to interference, miscalibration, and subjective interpretation. Cannot access  or utilize Automatons/LLMs without facing severe stigma, further limiting complex data analysis.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry /  Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic, Automaton Stigma]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation : [Combat skills (likely minimal); ability to pilot watercraft beyond simple skiffs; proficiency in alligator harvesting/processing.]`

 **3. Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's textually constituted  inner life.*
    *   `- Core Trait: [Unshakeable Existential Curiosity: A profound, driving  need to understand the fundamental nature of reality, divinity, and the soul within the Primal Mama context.]` # Auth: [ This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Core Trait: [Methodical & Patient Investigator (within her own framework): Despite  the esoteric nature of her pursuit, she approaches her "experiments" with a self-defined rigor and patience.]` #  Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Core Trait: [Skepticism towards Dogma:  Questions the literal divinity of Reynolds, Reed, and Parsons, viewing them as powerful cultural constructs or perhaps lesser spiritual conduits, but  not the Ultimate Source.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Deified Celebrities] 
    *   `- Dominant Emotion: [A state of 'Anticipatory Awe' mixed with profound intellectual focus.  Can also exhibit frustration when experiments yield ambiguous results.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Key Motiv ator: [To achieve direct, verifiable contact with or understanding of a 'Primal Divine Source' she believes underpins existence , distinct from folk tales, celebrity worship, or even conventional ghostly interactions. She seeks the 'signal behind the noise'.]`  # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Key Belief: [That the spiritual is a fundamental layer  of reality, as tangible and measurable as any other, if one has the correct 'instruments' (both technological and perceptual ). Believes the Biological Calamity may have altered or made more accessible certain spiritual frequencies.]` # Auth: [This Codex  Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Biological Calamity, Spectral Interaction]
    *   `- Internal Conflict : [The desire for empirical proof of the divine vs. the inherently subjective nature of spiritual experience; the loneliness of her unique  path vs. a yearning for shared understanding; fear that the "Source" might be terrifyingly alien or simply absent.] ` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Possesses vivid memories  of potent, unexplainable childhood experiences in the deep swamp that she interpreted as early 'contacts' or 'calls',  which set her on her path. No amnesia.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `# Psychological  Undersaturation: [Specific opinions on mundane politics (e.g., meat oligarchy beyond how it affects resources); romantic  inclinations; detailed fears beyond her core existential ones.]`

**4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated  Position):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's place within the world's networks.*
    *    `- Official Role: [None. Self-styled 'Sister' and investigator of the numinous. Operates mostly  on the fringes of Lickskillet or in secluded bayou areas.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry] 
    *   `- Social Status: [Outsider Mystic. Regarded by some with wary respect for her perceived  wisdom or connection to 'other things', by others with suspicion or pity. Does not actively seek followers but occasionally attracts curious  or desperate individuals.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Primary Affiliation: [None formal . Considers herself affiliated with 'All Seekers of Deeper Truths'.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry ]
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations (Loose/Potential):`
        *   `[Cautious,  infrequent contact with certain Swamp Witches, primarily for trading rare herbs or comparing notes on unusual spectral phenomena (though their methods and  goals differ significantly).]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Swamp Witch Lore]
         *   `[May have sought out Erpenthropes if she knows of their "truth-seeking" nature, though  they might find her methods quaint or misguided, or potentially interesting.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal  Mama Coherence Protocol - Erpenthrope Knowledge]
    *   `- Key Relationship 1: [To 'Old  Man Tiber' (Lickskillet Scavenger): A pragmatic, transactional relationship. Tiber brings her odd tech scraps, unusual  bones, or news from the swamp, and she provides him with herbal remedies or occasionally interprets strange occurrences for him. He' s skeptical but finds her useful and oddly compelling.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `-  Key Relationship 2: [To 'The Echoes': Her term for the various spiritual entities and phenomena she contacts/ studies. A relationship of intense, one-sided (from the Echoes' perspective, perhaps) investigation and attempted communication.]` #  Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Key Relationship 3: [To 'Primal Mama'  (Conceptual): She theorizes the world itself, or a consciousness pervading it, might be the 'Primal Divine  Source' she seeks, particularly in its post-calamity, strangely spiritual state.]` # Auth: [This  Codex Entry / World Name]
    *   `- Species/Type: [Human (Baseline Post-Calamity Strain )]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `# Social Undersaturation: [Specific family ties  (if any living); enemies within the celebrity cults beyond general disapproval; any apprentices or dedicated followers.]`

**5. Modal  Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
   *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
    *   `- Property  ID: MODAL-IMA-01`
        *   *Property:* `[Cultivated Numinous Resonance (Epist emic/Alethic Exception)]`
        *   *Description:* `[Through sustained, unique ritualistic practices and use  of her self-designed analog sensory devices, Imani has achieved a heightened, albeit unstable, perception of and interaction with subtle spiritual  energies and entities beyond standard ghost ritual efficacy. She can occasionally 'tune into' or provoke responses from phenomena not typically accessible .]`
        *   *Limits:* `[Perception is often ambiguous, heavily reliant on her subjective interpretation and  the function of her temperamental 1970s-tech equipment. Can cause mental strain, physical exhaustion, or attract  unwanted spectral attention. Does not grant overt supernatural powers like Erpenthrope transformation or Swamp Witch magic.]`
        *    *Authentication:* `[Demonstrated via narrative portrayal of her experiments yielding unusual results distinct from standard ghost interactions; her unique equipment  behaving in ways that suggest detection of non-standard phenomena.]`
    *   `# Note: This property is  cultivated and learned, not innate like an Erpenthrope's, but pushes the boundaries of authenticated human potential for  spiritual interaction in Primal Mama.`

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   * Purpose: Define the character's value status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Lick skillet Locals): [Authenticated as viewed as 'the God-Seeker Woman', 'Sister Spooky-Sounds', 'either  touched by spirits or plain touched'. Generally harmless, but best not to get too involved in her 'experiments'. Some seek  her out for folk wisdom or dream interpretation.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `- Reputation (Swamp  Witches, if aware): [Authenticated as potentially 'a fellow traveler on a different path', 'one who listens to the wrong whispers  but listens nonetheless', or 'dangerously naive in her tinkering'.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Co herence Protocol - Swamp Witch Lore]
    *   `- Reputation (Celebrity Deity Clergy/Devotees):  [Authenticated as viewed as 'heretical', 'blasphemous for questioning the Divine Trio', 'a pur veyor of dangerous spiritual alternatives'.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Deified Celebrities Values ]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): [Authenticated via narrative focus as a sincere, if eccentric , seeker of profound truth, driven by a deep spiritual yearning rather than malice or self-aggrandizement. Her methods are unconventional  but not inherently evil.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation : [Reputation among Erpenthropes; views of the Beetriot elite (likely unaware or dismissive);  reputation among those who believe in the "invisible women" conspiracy.]`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
    *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: [ Authenticated as originating from a small, now-vanished deep-bayou community that held onto syncretic spiritual beliefs  blending pre-calamity African diasporic traditions with post-calamity swamp mysticism. Her drive is partly  to understand/validate these inherited beliefs through her own 'scientific-spiritual' lens.]` # Auth: [This Codex  Entry]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection (Subjective): [A childhood event where her isolated community experienced  a powerful, unexplainable 'visitation' or manifestation, which decimated some but left Imani with a profound sense of questioning  and a feeling of being 'marked' or 'called' to understand.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]
    *    `- Inherited Items:** [Authenticated to possess a few heavily weathered, hand-copied notebooks from her community's elders,  containing fragmented rituals, cosmological observations, and herbal lore written in a creolized script. Also, a non-functional but symbolic  'spirit box' – a 1970s transistor radio her grandfather tried to use for divination.]` # Auth : [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - 1970s Tech Aesthetic]
    *    `# Historical Undersaturation: [Precise details of her vanished community; specific nature of the 'visitation';  full content of the inherited notebooks.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core  identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Sister Imani Alile  is constituted as a unique figure in Primal Mama: a spiritual seeker whose African heritage and inherited swamp mysticism are filtered through a lens of  quasi-scientific inquiry, all constrained and flavored by the world's 1970s technological aesthetic. She  is a 'rogue theologian' attempting to empirically validate the existence of a 'Primal Divine Source' beyond the de ified celebrities, using ritual, self-made analog devices, and deep environmental listening. Her 'experiments' are a testament  to human ingenuity and spiritual yearning in a world where the veil is thin and technology serves unusual masters. She embodies the search  for authentic meaning amidst the bizarre, retro-futuristic, and spiritually charged miasma of Primal Mama.`
*   ** Primary Narrative Function:** `To explore the deeper, more esoteric spiritual dimensions of Primal Mama beyond established norms (celebrity gods , standard ghost lore). She can act as a source of unique, potentially dangerous knowledge, a guide to hidden spiritual realities , or a character whose quest uncovers fundamental truths (or unsettling ambiguities) about the world's nature, the Biological Calam ity's spiritual impact, or the 'Primal Mama' entity itself. Her methods offer a distinct flavor of investigation , blending the archaic with the retro-tech.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The drive  for empirical proof vs. the subjective nature of faith/spirituality; the tension between her inherited traditions and her innovative ( and potentially heretical) methods; loneliness of her singular pursuit vs. a desire for validation or community; hope for divine  connection vs. fear of cosmic indifference or alien malevolence.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle): ** `Actually making a significant breakthrough in contacting/understanding a 'Primal Echo' or the 'Source'; her experiments  having unforeseen consequences on the local spiritual ecosystem (e.g., attracting powerful entities, or briefly thinning the veil further); facing  direct opposition from the celebrity cults or other powers; finding unexpected allies (perhaps an Erpenthrope intrigued by her persistence , or a Swamp Witch seeing a kindred spirit); potentially discovering that the 'God' she seeks is far stranger or more integrated  into the Primal Mama world (e.g., the swamp itself, the collective unconscious, or even the nature of the GE all igators) than she imagines.`
