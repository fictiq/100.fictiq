## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings)  within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions  are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle .*

*   **Core Essence:** `Tebe Mokoena is constituted as a proud, skilled, and fundamentally  decent man, an independent alligator farmer embodying the self-reliant spirit of Primal Mama's Lickskillet region . His African heritage is subtly woven into his identity through names and minor cultural expressions, adapted to the swamp world. He is defined  by his practical expertise with GE solar gators and 1970s-aesthetic technology, and his deep connection  to his family and modest business. Crucially, he is constituted as a primary **victim** of the encroaching Meat  Oligarchy, whose economic power and ruthless tactics are systematically destroying his livelihood and crushing his spirit. His struggle highlights the tension  between individual autonomy and corporate-style power within Primal Mama's unique socio-economic landscape.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function :** `To embody the plight of the "common man" under duress from systemic injustice (the Meat Oligarchy); To  serve as a focal point for exploring themes of economic disparity, resilience, desperation, and the potential for resistance or tragedy in L ickskillet. He can act as a catalyst for a protagonist's involvement, a source of local information, or a tragic  figure whose fate underscores the world's harsh realities.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Pride  in self-sufficiency vs. the crushing reality of his powerlessness; Hope for the future of his family vs. encro aching despair; The urge to resist or seek justice vs. the paralyzing fear of complete ruin and Oligarchy retaliation;  Loyalty to traditional methods vs. the need for new, perhaps ethically grey, solutions to survive.`
*   **Potential for  Development (Based on Bundle):** `Tebe could be pushed to make desperate choices: seeking help from unconventional sources (an  Erpenthrope sympathetic to the downtrodden? A reclusive Swamp Witch with an axe to grind against the Oligarchy?),  attempting a risky act of defiance, falling into deeper despair and paranoia, or being reluctantly forced to abandon his farm and seek  work within the very system destroying him. His victimization could radicalize him or break him.`
