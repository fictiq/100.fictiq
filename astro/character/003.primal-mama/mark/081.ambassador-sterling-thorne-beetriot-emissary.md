## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of  **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Dole žel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source  (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template  to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the ** richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and  the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's  being within the heterocosm, referencing Primal Mama's established rules.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form  & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence, reflecting Beetriot sophistication within the  1970s aesthetic.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Human male, early 40s,  meticulously groomed. Appears healthy, a benefit of Beetriot's controlled environment and access to resources beyond simple alligator meat ( e.g., hydroponics, carefully curated non-cattle proteins).]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Setting,  Inferred Beetriot Elite Status]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Smooth, unweathered complexion  contrasting sharply with swamp-dwellers. Sharp, analytical eyes that constantly assess. Hair styled in a neat, slightly feathered  fashion popular in late 1970s Beetriot high society.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Aesthetic  Constraint, Inferred Social Standing]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [None visible; cultivates an  image of unflappable perfection. Any scars would be minor and carefully concealed.]` # Auth: [Character Concept]
    *    `- Typical Attire: [Impeccably tailored leisure suits in muted earth tones or deep blues (e. g., brushed corduroy, high-quality textured polyester blends). Wide lapels, flared trousers. Polished, slightly  platformed shoes. Always wears a chunky, official-looking chronometer on a wide leather strap – a status symbol in  Beetriot. Carries a slim, hard-shell briefcase with prominent brass clasps and a wood-grain veneer panel.] ` # Auth: [Primal Mama Tech Aesthetic Constraint, Axiological Value of 1970s Style]
    *    `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Modulated, calm, articulate baritone. Speaks with precise, carefully chosen words , betraying a formal Beetriot education. Avoids slang or overly casual swamp vernacular, though he understands it.]` # Auth:  [Character Concept, Implied Beetriot Culture]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: [Upright, confident  posture. Economical, deliberate movements. May exhibit slight discomfort or stiffness when traversing uneven swamp terrain, accustomed to Beetriot's paved  avenues. A habit of subtly adjusting his tie or cuffs – a tell for moments of stress or condescension.]` #  Auth: [Character Concept, Environment Contrast]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Faint, expensive ( by Primal Mama standards) synthetic musk cologne, a touch of ozone from personal tech, and the sterile scent of Beet riot's filtered air clinging to his clothes.]` # Auth: [Sensory Palette, Primal Mama Tech Aesthetic ]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/weight, specific brand of cologne, minor  personal preferences in clothing beyond the established aesthetic.]`

     *   `- Skill: [Proficient in Bureaucratic Protocol & Legal Jargon (Beetriot Standard).]`  # Auth: [Role, Inferred Beetriot Society]
    *   `- Skill: [Basic Self-Defense (Be etriot Elite mandatory training – likely more theoretical than practical in actual swamp combat). Carries a sleek, compact energy side arm of 1970s design, rarely drawn.]` # Auth: [Gun Ownership Norms (contrast  w/Beetriot), Tech Aesthetic]

    *   `- Key Belief (Pragmatic): [ Supernatural elements (Erpenthropes, Ghosts, Witches) are forces to be managed, understood instrumentally, or neutralized  if they threaten Beetriot's interests, rather than dismissed outright or truly embraced.]` # Auth: [Alethic Rules : Erpenthropes, Ghosts, Witches]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [Desire for Beet riot's "clean" order vs. the messy necessity of dealing with swamp cultures and their bizarre realities (e.g., vampire  bunnies as a legitimate concern for a trade partner).

A necessary evil, or a dangerous temptation.]` # Auth : [World Contrast, Deontic: Meat Oligarchy Friction]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle .*

*   **Core Essence:** `Ambassador Sterling Thorne is constituted as a quintessential agent of Beetriot's "civilized " retro-futurism, a man whose sophisticated 1970s veneer and pragmatic ambition are constantly tested by  the primal, spiritually-infused, and often bizarre realities of the wider Primal Mama world. He embodies the tension between urban  control and swamp wildness, advanced (bio/solar) tech filtered through an analog aesthetic, and official narratives versus unsettling  truths. His adherence to Beetriot's Deontic (e.g., Automaton stigma) and Axiological  (1970s style as peak) rules defines his interactions and limitations.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:**  `To act as a bridge or antagonist representing Beetriot's interests in the swamp; to drive plots involving negotiation, resource conflict , or urban encroachment on swamp territories/cultures; to provide an outsider's (albeit a biased one) perspective on the swamp 's denizens (Erpenthropes, Witches, Lickskillet folk); to highlight the cultural and  technological clashes within Primal Mama.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Maintaining composure/control  vs. visceral reactions to swamp phenomena; loyalty to Beetriot's potentially sterile order vs. the strange vitality of the swamp;  personal ambition vs. the genuine dangers of his post; the official Beetriot understanding of the world vs. contradictory evidence he  might encounter (e.g., from Erpenthropes or ghosts).`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on  Bundle):** `Could be "corrupted" or "enlightened" by prolonged exposure to the swamp, potentially  questioning Beetriot's dogma (Psychological/Epistemic shift). Might forge unexpected, genuine alliances (Social/Relational  change). Could be forced to adapt his methods, becoming more ruthless or more empathetic (Functional/Psychological change). His understanding  of the "incredible source of energy" (solar) or alligator biogenesis might deepen or be challenged.`
