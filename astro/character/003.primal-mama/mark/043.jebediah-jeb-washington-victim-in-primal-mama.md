## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm . Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by  the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition** .*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose  complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

    *    `- Inherited Items (Lost): [Likely lost all family heirlooms, tools of his trade, and his  home. The brand is an "inherited" mark of his persecution.]` # Auth: [Backstory]
     *   `- Inherited Items (Possessed): [Perhaps a single, deeply hidden, small, and valueless memento of  his previous life, like a carved alligator tooth given by a now-lost loved one, or a worn religious icon of  one of the deified celebrities that failed to protect him.]` # Auth: [Narrative detail for pathos]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Jebediah Washington is constituted as a living testament to the destructive power of unsubstantiated belief  and mob justice within Primal Mama. His identity is forged in the crucible of false accusation related to the "Invisible Women" conspiracy,  stripping him of his livelihood, dignity, and social existence. His Physical deterioration mirrors his Psychological scarring (bitterness, paranoia , resignation). His Functional limitations are direct consequences of his Social ostracization and the historical trauma he endured. He is  a man whose knowledge of the swamp's truths (practical survival) is rendered useless by the societal "truths" (con spiracy beliefs) that condemned him. He embodies the tragic intersection of Primal Mama's epistemic frailties (the power  of conspiracy) and its deontic harshness (summary, irreversible social punishment).`
*   **Primary Narrative Function :** `Serves as a potent example of the human cost of Primal Mama's societal fears and superstitions ( specifically the "Invisible Women" conspiracy). He can act as a cautionary figure, a source of grim firsthand information for a protagonist investigating  such phenomena, or a moral challenge (can he be helped? Is redemption/justice possible for him in this world?). His  existence highlights the fragility of truth and status in the face of widespread, weaponized belief.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts  (From Bundle):** `Survival instinct vs. utter despair; Lingering bitterness vs. profound weariness; Fear of others  vs. a deeply buried longing for justice or acknowledgement; The man he was vs. the broken shell he has become.` 
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `His arc could involve: a protagonist slowly earning his trust, leading  him to share his story (Epistemic change for protagonist, psychological release for Jeb); a desperate attempt to help him  (testing Axiological and Deontic limits of the society); him finding a small measure of peace or purpose, even if justice  remains elusive; or, conversely, his final succumbing to despair or further persecution.`
