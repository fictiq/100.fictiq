# Story World Codex: Fictional Person Constitution  Protocol
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

 **World:** Primal Mama
**Codex Version:** 0.1 - Character Constitution

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the  specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties ( Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `-  Appearance_General: Humanoid female form. Appears to be in her late 30s, though her true  age is indeterminate due to Erpenthrope near-immortality. Wiry, strong physique adapted to swamp life.`  # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Erpenthrope nature)
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features:  Eyes are a striking, almost unnatural shade of swamp-green, keen and observant. Skin is tanned and weathered, often  bearing faint, almost imperceptible scale-like patterns on her forearms and neck in certain light. Hair is long, dark , often matted with bits of flora or bound with sinew.` # Auth: Narrative Description / Erpenthrope Traits 
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: Several old, well-healed scars that hint at past conflicts,  some too regular to be from animals. A slight, almost predatory set to her jaw.` # Auth: Narrative Description
    *    `- Typical Attire: Practical, durable clothing made from treated animal hides (not cattle), woven plant fibers, and  salvaged synthetic fabrics. Often incorporates discarded 1970s-aesthetic tech components as adornments or functional clasps ( e.g., a polished transistor as a pendant, a chunky button as a fastener). Goes barefoot in the swamp,  wears sturdy, patched boots in settlements.` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (70s aesthetic, swamp environment) 
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: Low, measured, with a slight, archaic Southern drawl. Speaks economically , but with underlying authority. Her vocalizations in Alligator Beast Man form are guttural roars and hisses.` # Auth:  Narrative Dialogue / Erpenthrope Traits
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: Moves with a fluid,  almost silent grace in human form, betraying an underlying predatory awareness. Often observes from the shadows. Habit of tilting her head  when listening intently. Displays reptilian stillness when observing.` # Auth: Narrative Description
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any ): Damp earth, ozone (from proximity to solar-charged entities or her own bio-energy), and a faint, musky rept ilian scent that is more pronounced near transformation.` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Solar Dominance, Gator Biology)
     *   `# Physical Undersaturation: Precise height/weight. Exact nature of all scars. Full wardrobe details.`

**2 . Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and * cannot* do.*
    *   `- Skill: Expert Swamp Survivalist (Navigation, tracking, foraging, understanding of  bayou ecosystems, silent movement).` # Auth: Demonstrated Actions / Erpenthrope Adaptation
    *   `- Skill: Form idable Unarmed Combatant (Human form); Devastating Melee Combatant (Alligator Beast Man form – claws , teeth, tail).` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Erpenthrope transformation)
    *   `- Skill:  Limited understanding of Ritual Magic (specifically for interacting with ghosts, learned through ancient Erpenthrope traditions).` # Auth : Primal Mama Codex (Spectral Interaction, Erpenthrope Knowledge)
    *   `- Skill: Basic repair  of simple, analog 1970s-style technology (out of necessity for survival, not sophisticated engineering).` #  Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Tech Aesthetic)
    *   `- Ability (Unique): Erpenthropic Transformation  (can shift between human and Alligator Beast Man form; transformation is physically demanding).` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex  (Alethic Modality)
    *   `- Ability (Unique): Near-Immortality (Ageless;  highly resistant to disease and toxins; rapid regeneration from most wounds, especially lost limbs like a tail in gator form.  Not truly unkillable by conventional means but can be overwhelmed by massive trauma).` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Aleth ic Modality)
    *   `- Ability (Unique): Heightened Senses (Vision, hearing, smell, vibration  sense far beyond human norms, more acute in gator form). Can sense shifts in atmospheric pressure and solar energy fluctuations.`  # Auth: Erpenthrope Traits / Primal Mama Codex (Solar Dominance)
    *   `- Limitation  (Physical): Transformation into Alligator Beast Man form is energetically costly and cannot be sustained indefinitely without rest/recharge ( drawing on ambient solar/bio-energy). Vulnerable during the transformation process itself. In human form, while strong, she is not  superhumanly so without transformation.` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Alligator Biogenesis inspiration for Erpenthrope  traits)
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): While possessing vast historical knowledge, specifics of pre-Calamity  advanced science (e.g., original cattle-plague vector, advanced LLM theory) are lost or fragmented. Her  knowledge of Beetriot's high-tech oligarchy is largely external observation.` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex ( Epistemic Modality - Calamity Obscured)
    *   `- Limitation (Social): Profoundly  distrustful of large, centralized authorities (like Beetriot's elite or the meat oligarchy). Her true nature,  if widely known, would incite fear and persecution outside of remote swamp communities.` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Deontic/ Axiological structure)
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: Proficiency with firearms (likely avoids them as  'impersonal'). Ability to pilot complex vehicles. Deep understanding of genetic engineering specifics beyond her own nature.`

**3 . Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's textually constituted inner life.*
     *   `- Core Trait: Stoic / Patient / Watchful (Centuries of observation).` # Auth:  Erpenthrope Nature / Narrative Depiction
    *   `- Core Trait: Fiercely Independent / Self -Reliant.` # Auth: Lifestyle / Primal Mama Values (Autonomy)
    *   `- Core Trait : Innate Drive for Truth and Understanding (Core Erpenthrope trait).` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Axi ological/Epistemic Modality for Erpenthropes)
    *   `- Dominant Emotion: A  deep, abiding weariness and sorrow for the world's follies, balanced by a fierce, primal protectiveness of  the natural world (especially the swamps).` # Auth: Internal Monologue (Implied) / Actions
    *    `- Key Motivator: To preserve the balance of the swamp ecosystem. To uncover and preserve hidden truths about the Calamity and the  world's true history. To act as a bulwark against existential threats to the bayou.` # Auth: Narrative  Goals / Erpenthrope Axiology
    *   `- Key Belief: Believes that "Primal Mama"  (the sentient spirit/essence of the bayou/planet) is real and that the world has fallen out of balance  due to human actions, particularly the hubris leading to the Calamity and the subsequent societal structures.` # Auth:  Primal Mama title inspiration / Internal Monologue
    *   `- Key Belief: Views the deification of celebrities like  Burt Reynolds as a symptom of humanity's detachment from deeper truths, though finds some ironic amusement in it.` # Auth:  Erpenthrope Truth-seeking vs. Cultural Values
    *   `- Internal Conflict: The desire for solitude and non -interference vs. the compulsion to act when core truths or the swamp's balance are threatened. The burden of her ancient knowledge  vs. the difficulty of imparting it to short-lived, often foolish humans.` # Auth: Narrative Tension
    *    `- Subjective Memory Content: Possesses authenticated, vivid memories stretching back before the Biological Calamity, including the era  when cattle were commonplace food. Remembers the initial chaos and the societal shifts. Her memories of the Calamity itself are traumatic  and somewhat fragmented, a source of her truth-seeking.` # Auth: Historical Properties / Erpenthrope Near-Immortality 
    *   `# Psychological Undersaturation: Specific opinions on 1970s music genres beyond finding  the aesthetic amusingly persistent. Romantic inclinations (likely considers such bonds fleeting). Detailed philosophical views beyond core beliefs.`

** 4. Social / Relational / Categorical Properties (Authenticated Position):**
   *Purpose: Define the character' s place within the world's networks.*
    *   `- Official Role: None. Operates entirely outside formal  societal structures.` # Auth: Narrative Depiction
    *   `- Social Status: Outsider. Regarded as a  legend, a dangerous cryptid, or a wise woman by various swamp communities. Feared or dismissed as myth by Beet riot authorities.` # Auth: World Lore / Axiological Properties
    *   `- Primary Affiliation: Erpenthropes  (as a species/type, though largely solitary). Considers herself allied with the "spirit" of the Primal Mama swamp.`  # Auth: Erpenthrope Nature
    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: Wary, transactional relationships with certain  Swamp Witches (mutual respect for ancient power, but differing methods/goals). Occasional, cryptic interactions with isolated mom -and-pop alligator farmers who still respect old traditions.` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Swamp Witches, L ickskillet culture)
    *   `- Key Relationship 1: (Antagonistic) To the Meat Oligarchy:  Views them as a source of corruption, exploitation, and ecological imbalance, particularly their push for mass-produced GE gators over  sustainable practices.` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Deontic - Friction)
    *   `- Key Relationship 2:  (Ambivalent/Observational) To Beetriot Elite: Sees them as detached, arrogant, and perpetuators of the  cattle-artifact absurdity, but also a source of dangerous, world-altering power.` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex  (Cattle as Artifacts)
    *   `- Key Relationship 3: (Protective/Guidance) To certain individuals  who show respect for the "old ways" or genuinely seek truth (e.g., a particular struggling alligator farmer,  a curious historian, etc.).` # Auth: Narrative Potential
    *   `- Species/Type: Erpenthrope.`  # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Alethic Modality)
    *   `# Social Undersaturation:  Specific named long-term allies (most would be dead). Any formal enemies within Erpenthrope society (if such  exists). Her precise standing among the varied ghost communities.`

**5. Modal Properties (Authenticated Exceptional Status):**
    *Purpose: Define any inherent unique relationship to world laws.*
    *   `- Property ID: MODAL-RIVERM -01`
        *   *Property:* `Erpenthropic Nature (Alethic/Epist emic Exception)`
        *   *Description:* `Authenticated ability to transform into a formidable Alligator Beast Man, possess near- immortality (agelessness, enhanced regeneration). Innate capacity to perceive and seek deeper truths obscured from general populace,  including direct, albeit limited, interaction with spectral entities without need for elaborate rituals for basic awareness. Direct connection to and understanding of " Primal Mama" (the world's vital essence).`
        *   *Limits:* `Transformation is physically taxing  and has vulnerabilities. Near-immortality is not true invulnerability. Truth perception can be overwhelming or lead to dangerous  knowledge. Her understanding of "Primal Mama" is intuitive, not scientific.`
        *   *Authentication:* `Primal Mama  Coherence Codex (Alethic Modalities: Erpenthropic Transformation, Spectral Interaction, Alligator Biogenesis ( as analogous model for energy needs), Epistemic Modalities: Erpenthrope Knowledge).`

**6. Axiological  Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's value status *within* Pr imal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Swamp Communities of Lickskillet region): Authenticated as viewed  as a 'Swamp Mother,' 'Old Gator Woman,' a figure of legend, both feared and revered. Some seek  her for wisdom on swamp lore or hidden things; others blame her for unexplained occurrences.` # Auth: Oral Traditions / Local Belief s
    *   `- Reputation (Beetriot Elite/Meat Oligarchy): If existence confirmed, authenticated as viewed  as a 'dangerous biological anomaly,' a threat to controlled narratives and potentially to GE alligator market dominance. To be neutralized or exploited  if possible.` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex (Oligarchy values, control)
    *   `- Reputation (Sw amp Witches): Authenticated as viewed as an ancient, powerful entity, kin to the deep magic of the swamp. A  potential ally or formidable rival depending on agendas. Respected for her longevity and connection to primal forces.` # Auth: Primal Mama Codex  (Swamp Witch Lore)
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): Authenticated via narrative focus as  a guardian of ecological truth and historical memory, operating on a morality rooted in natural law and long-term balance, often at  odds with contemporary human societal norms.` # Auth: Thematic Role
    *   `# Axiological Undersaturation: Her  reputation among those who worship the celebrity deities (they likely don't know she exists or view her as a 'monster ' from old tales). Reputation among any other Erpenthropes.`

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past  Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's known origins and connections to past events.*
    *    `- Origin: Authenticated as pre-dating the Biological Calamity, or being one of the first Erpenthropes  to emerge in its immediate aftermath. Her exact 'birth' or transformation into an Erpenthrope is lost to time , even for her, existing as a primal, core memory rather than a sequential event.` # Auth: Primal Mama  Codex (Erpenthrope near-immortality)
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection (Subjective):  Possesses direct, experiential memories of the world before cattle became taboo, the chaos of the Calamity, the rise  of alligator dependency, the cultural ossification of the 1970s aesthetic, and the gradual deification of figures  like Burt Reynolds (which she finds particularly baffling).` # Auth: Erpenthrope lifespan interacting with world history
    *    `- Inherited Items: A pouch containing smooth river stones from pre-Calamity rivers, a piece of fused metal  from an unknown event during the Calamity, and a single, perfectly preserved firefly in amber – items of personal , historical significance.` # Auth: Narrative Detail
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: Her precise actions or role  during the height of the Biological Calamity. The exact origin of Erpenthropes as a species. Any  interactions with the individuals who would later become deified celebrities.`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

 *Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core  Essence:** `River "Reba" McIntyre is constituted as an ancient, quasi-mythical Erpenthrope,  a living embodiment of Primal Mama's enduring, untamed bayou heart and its deep, often painful, history.  Her Physical properties reflect a seamless blend of human adaptability and reptilian power, sustained by her unique Modal connection to the world 's solar and vital energies. Functionally, she is a supreme survivor and a guardian, capable of formidable action and subtle  influence. Psychologically, she is defined by her Erpenthropic drive for Truth, burdened by millennia of memory yet  fiercely committed to a primal sense of justice and balance. Socially an outsider, her Axiological status oscillates between revered legend  and feared anomaly. Her Historical depth provides a unique lens on the world's current state, viewing its 1970 s retro-futurism and celebrity worship with an ancient, knowing weariness.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:**  `Serves as a conduit to the deeper lore and forgotten truths of Primal Mama. Can act as a catalyst for change , a mentor to those who respect the old ways, or a formidable obstacle to those who would further unbalance the world.  Embodies the "strangely spiritual miasma" and the tension between the artificial constructs of society (Beetriot, olig archy, tech aesthetic) and the enduring power of nature.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** ` The burden of ancient memory vs. the fleeting concerns of current inhabitants. The Erpenthropic drive for truth vs. the pain  and danger such truth often brings. The instinct for solitude vs. the primal imperative to protect her domain (the swamp/ Primal Mama). Her innate wildness vs. the encroaching, often absurd, "civilization" with its cattle -artifacts and Automaton-stigma.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Recovery  or sharing of specific, pivotal memories about the Calamity or the origin of Erpenthropes. Formation of unlikely  alliances (e.g., with a "truth-seeking" Automaton user, or a younger character disillusioned with the celebrity  cults). Being forced to directly confront the Meat Oligarchy or Beetriot's power structures. A deeper exploration of her connection  to "Primal Mama" and the nature of spectral entities.`
