## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama  heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them ** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition **.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating  multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions  are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

    *   `- Reputation (L ickskillet General): [Authenticated as 'ruined', 'bad luck', 'possibly a cattle sympathizer' ( a devastating accusation, likely false but spread by his enemies).

Deacon resisted , and was subsequently framed for attempting to deal in illicit cattle parts (a capital offense) and/or using "unlicensed , destabilizing LLM-driven inventory systems" that violated the 1970s aesthetic and automation stigma, allowing  for asset seizure.]` # Auth: [Narrative event, Primal Mama Coherence (Cattle Prohibition, Automaton St igma, 70s Tech Constraint, Oligarchy Friction)]
    *   `- Inherited Items:** [Lost almost  everything. May secretly possess a single, tarnished silver dollar minted with Burt Reynolds's profile – a keepsake from his  father, representing "luck and swagger," now a bitter reminder.]` # Auth: [Narrative inventory, Primal Mama Co herence (Deified Celebrities)]
    *   `# Historical Undersaturation: [Specific details of his ancestors  beyond "gator hunters"; the exact individuals in the oligarchy who orchestrated his downfall; the precise nature of the " evidence" used to frame him.]`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize  the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:**  `Deacon Washington is constituted as a living testament to the brutal socio-economic realities of Primal Mama, particularly the  "friction" caused by the meat oligarchy. He is a man stripped of his livelihood, reputation, and dignity through  the cynical manipulation of Primal Mama's core Deontic (cattle laws, tech stigma) and Axiological (value of  conformity, fear of taboo) rules. His existence is defined by loss, flavored by the enforced 1970 s retro-futurism that once characterized his small business's charm and now feels like a mocking echo. He  represents the discarded "mom-and-pop" ideal in a world increasingly controlled by unseen corporate powers in Beetriot.` 
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a potent example of the meat oligarchy's oppressive power and the human  cost of their expansion. He can act as a cautionary tale, a source of localized information about the oligarchy's methods  in Lickskillet, or a desperate individual who might be spurred to action (or seek help) if a protagonist offers  a glimmer of hope or a path to minor revenge/revelation. He grounds the more fantastical elements of Primal Mama in relatable  human suffering.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `Desire for justice/revenge vs. paraly zing fear of the oligarchy's reach; clinging to the values of hard work and faith in local deities (Reynolds , Reed, Parsons) vs. the stark reality of being failed by those very ideals; the impulse to trust potential allies vs. deep -seated suspicion born from betrayal.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Deacon could be pushed  to a breaking point, leading to a reckless act of defiance. He might find a new, albeit diminished, purpose if  offered a safe way to contribute to undermining his enemies (e.g., providing information to Erpenthropes or other  rebels). He could also fully succumb to despair and paranoia, becoming a more tragic figure or a pawn in someone else's game . Recovery of any part of his former self or status is highly improbable without significant external intervention that challenges the oligarchy's power .`
