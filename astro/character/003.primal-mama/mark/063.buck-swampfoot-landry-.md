## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm . Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by  the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition** .*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose  complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heter ocosm.)*

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character 's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General: Human male, late 50s, wir y and tough from years of physical labor. Skin deeply tanned and weathered like old leather from sun and swamp exposure.` # Auth:  [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Implied Environment]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: Sharp, observant  eyes that squint habitually. A prominent, stubborn jaw often working on a piece of synth-jerky. Thinning grey -brown hair usually tucked under a cap.` # Auth: [Character Conception]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks:  A few faded scars on his arms from close calls with gators or processing machinery. Tip of his left index finger is missing ( a common "processor's mark").` # Auth: [Character Conception - Implied Hazards]
    *   `- Typical Att ire: Faded, patched-up denim overalls over a plaid, long-sleeved work shirt (often with a  1970s color palette like avocado green or harvest gold). Heavy-duty, waterproof swamp boots. A worn baseball  cap with a faded "Smokey and the Bandit Trans Am" logo or similar period-appropriate motif.` # Auth:  [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Tech Aesthetic Constraint; Deified Celebrities]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern:  Slow, deliberate Southern drawl, laced with local Lickskillet idioms. Voice is gravelly. Tends to be  laconic unless riled up about "Beetriot regulations" or "oligarch price-gouging."` # Auth:  [Character Conception - Regional Flavor]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms: Economical movements, no wasted effort . Often wipes hands on his overalls. Has a habit of expectorating synth-jerky juice. Squints at  anything new or official-looking.` # Auth: [Character Conception]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): F aint but persistent aroma of processed alligator, swamp water, diesel from his airboat, and cheap, 1970 s-style synthetic pipe tobacco.` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Environment, Tech Aesthetic]
    *    `# Physical Undersaturation: Exact height/weight, specific brand of synth-jerky, favorite color of plaid  shirt (though likely muted/earthy).`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
   * Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*
    *   `- Skill: Expert All igator Butchering & Small-Scale Processing (Proficient with both wild-caught and GE gator anatomy differences).` # Auth : [Character Conception - Core Profession]
    *   `- Skill: Proficient Airboat Operation & Basic Maintenance (within  1970s tech aesthetic limitations – knows his chunky engine block well).` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol  - Watercraft Transport, Tech Aesthetic]
    *   `- Skill: Competent Shotgun Use (for pest control –  vampire bunnies, oversized swamp rats – and personal defense, as is custom outside Beetriot).` # Auth: [Pr imal Mama Coherence Protocol - Gun Ownership]
    *   `- Skill: Basic Bartering and Negotiation (Lickskillet- style, relies on reputation and established relationships).` # Auth: [Character Conception - Mom-and-Pop Economy]
     *   `- Limitation (Physical): Not as young as he used to be; stamina for heavy lifting is good but finite . Occasional back twinges.` # Auth: [Character Conception - Age]
    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge):  Poor understanding of advanced genetic engineering principles ("They just work, mostly") or complex economics beyond local supply/demand. Deep ly suspicious and ignorant of Automaton/LLM functionalities, viewing users with disdain.` # Auth: [Primal Mama  Coherence Protocol - Automaton Stigma, Tech Aesthetic/Epistemic implications]
    *   `- Limitation ( Social): Little influence beyond his immediate community. Struggles to navigate Beetriot bureaucracy or legal challenges from meat oligarchies without help .` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Oligarchy Friction]
    *   `- Limitation (Financial ): Operates on tight margins; vulnerable to price manipulation by larger players in the alligator meat market.` # Auth: [Pr imal Mama Coherence Protocol - Oligarchy Friction]
    *   `# Functional Undersaturation: Ability to perform  advanced ritual magic (highly unlikely), detailed knowledge of pre-calamity history, piloting larger vessels.`

**3.  Psychological Properties (Authenticated Interiority):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's textually constituted inner life.*

    *   `- Dominant Emotion: Grumbling Resignation / Sto ic Pragmatism (knows the world is tough, but you gotta keep going).` # Auth: [Character Conception ]

    *   `- Key Belief: "A man's work  is his worth." Believes in tangible results and honest labor. Cattle are weird art for rich folk; gator is  honest food.` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Cattle as Artifacts, Alligator Meat Primary Protein]
     *   `- Key Belief: Reveres Burt Reynolds, Jerry Reed, and Gram Parsons as embodying ideals of rugged individualism, anti -authoritarian charm, and authentic (Southern) soul, respectively. Might have a faded poster or two in his processing  shed.` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Deified Celebrities, Axiological Values]
    *    `- Internal Conflict: Desire for independence vs. crushing economic pressure from meat oligarchies.

Pride vs. occasional necessity to deal with ' unsavory' elements for survival.` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Oligarchy Friction]
    *    `- Subjective Memory Content: Vivid memories of Lickskillet life stretching back decades. Stories heard about the "Big  Spoil" (local term for the Biological Calamity) are more legend than precise history. Believes the "invisible women"  conspiracy might have *some* truth to it, "stands to reason someone's pulling strings."` # Auth: [ Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Conspiracy Beliefs, Epistemic Modalities]
    *   `# Psychological  Undersaturation: Specific details of his relationship with (implied) family, detailed theological understanding of the celebrity deities ( more lived reverence than doctrine), specific fears beyond economic ruin or gator attack.`

   *Purpose: Define the character's place within the world's networks.*
    *    `- Official Role: Owner-Operator, "Swampfoot's Select Gator" (unincorporated small business in Licksk illet).` # Auth: [Character Conception]

    *   `- Secondary Affiliations: Occasional , wary dealings with local Swamp Witch for "pest solutions" (e.g., too many vampire bunnies near his pens ) or rare ingredients. Knows *of* Erpenthropes, treats them with distant, fearful respect if encountered.` # Auth : [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Swamp Witches, Erpenthropes]
    *   `- Key Relationship  1: To "The Consolidated Gator Conglomerate" (Meat Oligarchy): Adversarial – they set prices, control  distribution, and generally make his life harder through "friction."` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Deont ic/Axiological Friction]
    *   `- Key Relationship 2: To Jedediah "Gator -Tooth" Grimshaw (Neighboring small processor): Competitive camaraderie; they might complain together about the Conglomerate but also  vie for the best catchments in the Saurian Sanctuary when the gates open.` # Auth: [Character Conception, Saur ian Sanctuary Access]
    *   `- Key Relationship 3: To the memory/icons of Burt Reynolds/Jerry Reed: Rever ential; sees them as spiritual guides for navigating a tough world with grit and a bit of style.` # Auth: [Primal Mama  Coherence Protocol - Deified Celebrities]
    *   `- Species/Type: Human (Standard Post-Calam ity Bayou Strain).` # Auth: [World Setting]

        *   *Limits:* `Subject to all standard biological needs, societal laws (including the cattle consumption  taboo, which he upholds without question as "just how things are, and for good reason too, I reckon"). `
        *   *Authentication:* `Absence of any textual evidence to the contrary; consistency with "human citizen" role.` 

**6. Axiological Properties (Authenticated Value/Reputation):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's value  status *within* Primal Mama.*
    *   `- Reputation (Lickskillet Locals): Authenticated as "a  tough old coot," "knows his gators," "honest in his dealings (mostly)," "hates them  Beetriot pencil-pushers." Generally respected for his resilience and skill.` # Auth: [Implied community perception]
     *   `- Reputation (Meat Oligarchy Representatives): Authenticated as "minor independent operator," "potential source of local unrest  if pushed too hard but ultimately insignificant," "resistant to modernization (i.e., buyout)." ` # Auth: [ Implied antagonist perception]
    *   `- Moral Alignment (Narrative Framing): Authenticated through his actions and internal  thoughts as fundamentally decent, hardworking, and loyal to his own code, which values self-reliance, community (Lickskillet- style), and a healthy disrespect for overreaching authority. Embodies the "common folk" struggling against larger forces.` # Auth : [Character Conception & Thematic Role]
    *   `- Value (Cultural): Possesses high value for his practical  skills within Lickskillet's economy. His adherence to the 1970s aesthetic in tools and taste  is unremarkable, as it's the cultural norm.` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol - Axiological Values,  Tech Aesthetic]

**7. Historical Properties (Authenticated Past Links):**
   *Purpose: Define the character' s known origins and connections to past events.*
    *   `- Origin: Born and raised in the Lickskillet  region, several decades post-Biological Calamity. His parents and grandparents were also swamp dwellers, adapting to the changing  world.` # Auth: [Character Conception - Generational Swamper]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection:  Witnessed the rise of the GE Alligators as the dominant protein source and the subsequent consolidation of power by the meat oligarchies.  Remembers a time when "mom-and-pop" operations had more autonomy.` # Auth: [Implied personal  history within world timeline]
    *   `- Key Past Event Connection: Has participated in regulated harvests within the Saurian Sanctuary  since he was a young man; recalls variations in access rules over the years.` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence  Protocol - Saurian Sanctuary Access]
    *   `- Inherited Items:** Authenticated to possess his grandfather's lucky  (1970s-era analog display) fish-finder, a collection of slightly warped 8-track tapes ( heavy on Jerry Reed and outlaw country), and the deed to his small plot and processing shed, written on surprisingly durable, synth -treated parchment with a dot-matrix printer font.` # Auth: [Character Conception, Primal Mama Tech Aesthetic]
     *   `# Historical Undersaturation: Specific details of his childhood beyond "grew up in the swamp." Any  direct personal experience with the more esoteric aspects of the world (e.g., ghost interactions) unless a narrative necessitates it.`

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Buck "Swampfoot" Landry is constituted  as a quintessential Lickskillet survivor: a pragmatic, fiercely independent alligator processor whose life is dictated by the rhythms of the swamp,  the demands of the GE gator economy, and the pervasive 1970s retro-future aesthetic. His identity is  forged in opposition to the impersonal power of the meat oligarchies and the distant, alien culture of Beetriot. He finds  solace and moral guidance in the deified figures of Reynolds, Reed, and Parsons, who represent an idealized form of the  rugged individualism he strives for. He is a man of simple tastes, deep-seated skepticism, and a profound, if gr umbling, resilience.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a viewpoint character illustrating the daily realities, struggles , and cultural norms of the common citizen in Primal Mama's Lickskillet region. He can provide exposition  on local customs, voice common grievances against the ruling powers (oligarchies, Beetriot), and react to the world' s more bizarre elements (Erpenthropes, Swamp Witches, vampire bunnies) with a grounded, relatable skepticism or  folk wisdom. He embodies the "mom-and-pop" spirit clashing with corporate control.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts  (From Bundle):** `The drive for self-sufficiency vs. the economic stranglehold of the meat oligarchies. Loyalty  to traditional (post-calamity) ways vs. the pragmatic need to adapt to new regulations or pressures. Personal  pride and gun-toting independence vs. the awareness of his own smallness in the face of larger forces. A  deep-seated suspicion of "progress" as defined by Beetriot vs. a reliance on the established GE gator/ solar tech.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Buck could be pushed to the breaking point by the  oligarchy, forcing him into reluctant activism or alliances with other marginalized groups (even Swamp Witches or, in extreme cases , Erpenthropes if their "truth-seeking" aligns). His faith in his celebrity deities could be tested or  provide unexpected inspiration. He might be forced to confront aspects of the world he prefers to ignore (e.g., the  true nature of the calamity, the reasons behind the Automaton stigma) if they directly impact his livelihood or community.`
