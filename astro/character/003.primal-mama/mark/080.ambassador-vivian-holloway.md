# Based  on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Text ually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal  Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them ** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition **.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating  multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions  are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential,  acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Authenticated Property Bundle:

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory  Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.*
    *   `- Appearance_General : [Human female, appears late 40s, poised and impeccably maintained. Medium height, slender build that  suggests discipline rather than fragility.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Visual Guide Concept]
    *   `- Appearance_ Specific Features: [Sharp, intelligent dark eyes that miss little. Defined jawline. Hair is a rich auburn,  always styled in a neat, professional coif reminiscent of late 1970s formal styles (e.g.,  a sophisticated wedge or feathered cut). Complexion is fair, suggesting diligent protection from the harsh sun, contrasting with swamp den izens.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Visual Guide Concept]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks: [A  single, tastefully small solar-charged lapel pin in the shape of the Beetriot city emblem – a stylized skyscraper entw ined with a solar flare. Wears subtle, 1970s-style gold jewelry.]` # Auth:  [Primal Mama Visual Guide Concept, World Coherence (Solar Dominance, 70s Aesthetic)]
    *    `- Typical Attire: [Custom-tailored pantsuits in muted but high-quality fabrics (e.g ., stone grey, deep ochre, olive green) with wide lapels and flared trousers, or elegant A-line dresses  with structured shoulders – all adhering to the late 1970s high-fashion aesthetic. Always wears heeled shoes  or boots, practical for navigating official Beetriot functions but somewhat challenging in Lickskillet's environs.]` # Auth : [Primal Mama Visual Guide Concept, World Coherence (Technological Aesthetic Constraint)]
    *   `- Voice/Speech  Pattern: [Modulated, clear alto voice with precise diction. Speech is articulate, diplomatic, and calm, even under  pressure. Avoids slang and overly casual vernacular. Capable of a subtle, disarming charm or a firm, non -negotiable tone as required.]` # Auth: [Narrative Description]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms:  [Graceful, deliberate movements. Maintains excellent posture. Often clasps her hands lightly in front of her when listening.  Has a habit of subtly adjusting her lapel pin when deep in thought or preparing to make a significant point.]` # Auth : [Narrative Description]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Faint, expensive floral perfume  (a rare luxury likely imported or synthesized in Beetriot) mixed with the sterile scent of recycled air from Beetriot's arc ologies, subtly clashing with the earthy miasma of the swamps when outside the city.]` # Auth: [Sens ory Palette, World Coherence (Beetriot vs. Swamp)]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation : [Exact height/weight, specific brand of perfume, presence of minor, non-visible scars or birthmarks.]`

    *   `- Limitation (Technical): [Reliant on Beetriot-maintained  1970s-aesthetic communication technology. May struggle with jury-rigged or less sophisticated Lickskillet systems . While she understands the *utility* of Automatons/LLMs, she is acutely aware of and adheres to the social  protocols minimizing their overt personal use to avoid reputational stain, preferring human attachés for sensitive tasks.]` # Auth: [World  Coherence (Tech Aesthetic, Automaton Stigma)]
    *   `- Limitation (Social): [Perceived as an  outsider in Lickskillet, potentially viewed with suspicion or resentment by locals and mom-and-pop operators. Her Beet riot polish can be a barrier.]` # Auth: [World Coherence (Beetriot vs. Lickskillet )]

    *   `- Subjective Memory Content: [Possesses detailed knowledge of Beetriot 's official history post-calamity.

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle .*

*   **Core Essence:** `Ambassador Vivian Holloway is constituted as a quintessential Beetriot elite, embodying its  values of order, technological sophistication (within the 1970s aesthetic), and reliance on the structured exploitation of the swamp' s resources. Her Physical polish and Functional capabilities in diplomacy are a direct product of her upbringing and training. Psychologically, she is  pragmatic and controlled, driven by a belief in Beetriot's civilizing mission, though this creates an internal conflict when  confronted with the raw, often ethically murky, realities of Lickskillet and the powerful, self-serving Meat Oligarchs.  Her Social position grants her authority but also isolates her from the very people she needs to understand and influence.`
*    **Primary Narrative Function:** `To act as a key interface and point of friction between the "civilized" urban center of Beetriot  and the "primal" resource-rich swamplands of Lickskillet. She can be a quest-giver,  an obstacle, a source of information (filtered through Beetriot's lens), or a potential ally/target depending on protagonist  goals. She embodies the themes of colonialism/neo-colonialism (Beetriot's dependence on and control over Licksk illet), order vs. chaos, and the compromises of power.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** ` Beetriot idealism/order vs. Lickskillet pragmatism/chaos; Adherence to diplomatic protocol vs. the  need for unconventional solutions to deal with oligarchs or swamp mysteries; Personal distaste/discomfort with the swamp vs. professional  necessity; Duty to Beetriot vs. nascent empathy or understanding for Lickskillet's plight (potential development).`
*    **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Her views on Lickskillet and its people could evolve  through prolonged exposure. She might be forced to make difficult ethical choices that challenge her Beetriot conditioning. She could become more deeply entangled  with the Meat Oligarchs (either as an opponent or a compromised pawn). Her official skepticism regarding the supernatural elements of Primal Mama  (Erpenthropes, ghosts, Swamp Witches) could be shattered by direct experience, forcing a re-evaluation of her  worldview. She might uncover inconvenient truths about Beetriot's history or its true relationship with the calamity.`
