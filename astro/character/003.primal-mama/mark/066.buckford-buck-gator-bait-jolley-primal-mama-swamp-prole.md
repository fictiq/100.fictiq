# Based on Dole žel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fict ional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within  the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from  the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Buck 'Gator-Bait' Jolley is constituted  as the quintessential Primal Mama swamp-lander: a fiercely independent, technologically traditional (1970s aesthetic adherent ), and deeply pragmatic alligator processor. His identity is forged by the bayou environment, the economic realities of the gator trade , and the cultural reverence for figures like Burt Reynolds. He is defined by his struggle against the encroaching meat oligarchy, his  adherence to the "old ways" of doing things (including his rejection of Automatons), and his unwavering belief in the  toxicity of cattle meat, a foundational rule of his world.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a ground -level perspective on life in Lickskillet, showcasing the everyday impact of Primal Mama's unique societal rules  (cattle taboo, gator economy, tech aesthetic, celebrity worship, Automaton stigma) and the central conflict between " mom-and-pop" operations and the powerful meat oligarchy. He can act as a source of local lore, a reluctant  ally, or a protagonist in stories focusing on the socio-economic struggles within the swamp.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts ( From Bundle):** `The need to survive and provide vs. his stubborn refusal to compromise his independence or values (e.g.,  by working for/with GatorCorp, or using "soul-staining" LLMs). Pride in his craft vs. the economic  obsolescence threatened by larger, more ruthless players. Loyalty to community vs. individual risk when speaking out.`
*   ** Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be pushed to the brink by oligarchy pressure, forcing him to either  break, make a desperate alliance (perhaps even with distrusted elements like an Erpenthrope or seeking aid from a Swamp Witch  if truly desperate), or find a novel way to resist within the world's constraints. Exposure to undeniable supernatural events could challenge  his pragmatic worldview. He might be forced to learn more about the GE gators or solar tech if his traditional methods fail .`
