# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica  III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This  protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama  heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them ** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition **.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating  multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded  in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is  intentionally left undefined.*

### Authent icated Property Bundle:

*(Detail the specific, validated properties constituting this character's being within the heterocosm.)* 

**1. Physical Properties (Authenticated Form & Sensory Signature):**
   *Purpose: Define the character's tangible presence.* 
    *   `- Appearance_General: [Wiry, sun-weathered human male, appears late 50s , with the leathery toughness of a life lived outdoors in the bayou.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol  - Lickskillet Environment Implication]
    *   `- Appearance_Specific Features: [Deep-set,  shrewd eyes that constantly scan; calloused, capable hands; a jaw perpetually working on a piece of dried gator jerky or  reed.]` # Auth: [Implied by Profession/Environment]
    *   `- Appearance_Distinctive Marks:  [Prominent, faded alligator bite scar on his left forearm – the source of his nickname. Missing tip of his right ring finger,  lost to a faulty winch (1970s tech!).]` # Auth: [Character Concept Detail]
    *    `- Typical Attire: [Worn denim overalls over a faded plaid work shirt (synthetic, quick-dry but  styled 1970s). Reinforced, knee-high swamp boots. Often a battered, wide-brimmed  hat made of GE-gator hide (a personal craft).]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence Protocol -  70s Aesthetic, Local Resources]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Slow, deliberate Southern drawl,  rich with Lickskillet colloquialisms. Tends towards understatement and dry wit. Distrustful of "fancy talk ."]` # Auth: [Implied by Archetype and Regional Setting]
    *   `- Gait/Mannerisms:  [Economical, sure-footed movements, even on treacherous swamp terrain or a bucking airboat. Habit of spitting  jerky juice. Frequently polishes the wood-panel accent on his trusty shotgun.]` # Auth: [Implied by Profession /Environment]
    *   `- Associated Scent (If Any): [Swamp mud, alligator musk, stale coffee , and a faint whiff of ozone from his airboat's solar charger unit.]` # Auth: [Sensory  Palette of Primal Mama]
    *   `# Physical Undersaturation: [Exact height/weight, specific eye  color beyond 'shrewd', dental condition.]`

**2. Functional Properties (Authenticated Capabilities & Limitations):**
    *Purpose: Define what the character *can* and *cannot* do.*

    *   `- Skill: [Proficient Airboat  Operation & Field Repair (Adept with its 1970s-style chunky controls, analog dials, and occasionally  temperamental solar converters)]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence - 70s Tech, Solar Dominance]
     *   `- Skill: [Small-Scale Alligator Butchering & Basic Preservation (For personal use and limited local trade, ' mom-and-pop' style)]` # Auth: [Role, Primal Mama Coherence - Lickskillet  Economy]
    *   `- Skill: [Competent Shotgun Use (For hunting, defense, and expressing local  pride in firearm ownership)]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence - Gun Ownership Norms]

    *   `- Limitation (Knowledge): [Deeply skeptical of and largely ignorant about the advanced  bio-engineering behind GE gators or the full workings of the meat oligarchy's financial structures. Relies on folk  knowledge and experience over "Beetriot book-learnin'." Avoids Automatons/LLMs due to ingrained social  stigma and personal distrust.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama Coherence - Epistemic Divides, Automaton St igma]

    *   `- Key Belief: [" The swamp provides for those who respect it and work it honest." Believes in the "old gods" (Reynolds, Reed, Parsons ) in a casual, cultural sense – their posters might be in his shack, representing a 'better time'. Mildly superstitious  about certain swamp phenomena (ghosts, witch-doings) but keeps a practical distance.]` # Auth: [Primal Mama  Coherence - Axiological (Deities), Epistemic (Ghosts/Witches)]
    *   `- Internal Conflict: [ Desire for a 'fair shake' vs. the overwhelming power of the oligarchy. Pride in traditional methods vs. the  subtle pressure to adopt more "efficient" (oligarchy-controlled) practices. Loyalty to community vs. individual survival needs .]` # Auth: [Narrative Potential]

Occasional, wary dealings with a local Swamp Witch for poultices or warding charms  against vampire bunnies.]` # Auth: [Flavor, Primal Mama Elements]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle .*

*   **Core Essence:** `Jebediah "Gator-Bait" Jones is constituted as the quintessential  Primal Mama Lickskillet denizen: a product of the post-Calamity world, his life and  livelihood inextricably linked to the GE solar alligators and the pervasive 1970s technological aesthetic. He embodies rugged  independence, traditional swamp wisdom, and a deep-seated suspicion of the encroaching meat oligarchy and the distant, decadent  Beetriot. His existence is a testament to adaptation, defined by the practical skills needed to survive in the bayou and navigate  its unique socio-economic landscape, all while clinging to a vanishing sense of autonomy and cultural identity symbolized by his firearms,  his battered airboat, and his quiet reverence for the celebrity deities of a "simpler" past.`
*    **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a grounding viewpoint character representing the everyday struggles, values, and perspectives of the common folk  in Primal Mama's rural, alligator-dependent regions like Lickskillet. He can act as a source  of local lore, an obstacle or ally to protagonists from outside his culture, and a direct illustration of the impact of the world 's core rules (e.g., Saurian Sanctuary regulations, oligarchy pressures, the utility and limitations of  1970s tech). He embodies the tension between individual self-reliance and systemic forces.`
*   **Key Internal  Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The drive for independence vs. the crushing economic power of the meat oligarchy. Ad herence to traditional methods/values vs. the necessity of adapting to survive in a technologically advanced (albeit aesthetically retro) world. Loyalty  to his community vs. the temptation of individual gain or escape. Skepticism of the "new" (Automatons, complex  GE explanations) vs. the undeniable reality of the world he lives in.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based  on Bundle):** `Could be pushed into a leadership role in local resistance against the oligarchy. Might be forced to confront  or reluctantly utilize elements he distrusts (e.g., information from an Automaton user, aid from an Erpenthrope ). Could have his folk beliefs challenged or confirmed by direct encounters with more overt supernatural elements (powerful ghosts, witch rituals). May  have to pass on his knowledge to a younger generation, confronting his own obsolescence or legacy.`
