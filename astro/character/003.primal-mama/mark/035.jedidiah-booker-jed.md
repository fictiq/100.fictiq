# Based  on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction: Constituting Fictional  Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings)  within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of  properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality  beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories.  Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose  actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

    *   `- Typical  Attire: [Worn, patched canvas overalls (color faded to a muddy green-brown) over a simple, dark  thermal undershirt – practical for swamp work, even if he has little left. Heavy-duty, oft-re paired rubber boots. Sometimes a wide-brimmed, battered hat made of gator hide scraps.]` # Auth : [This Codex Entry / Primal Mama Aesthetic]
    *   `- Voice/Speech Pattern: [Deep bar itone, speaks slowly and deliberately with a Lickskillet regional drawl. His words often carry a weight of bitterness or resignation , but can flare with carefully controlled anger when discussing his past or the oligarchs.]` # Auth: [This Codex Entry]

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and  narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Jedidiah Booker is constituted as a man  defined by loss and injustice within the Primal Mama heterocosm. His identity is inextricably linked to his mastery of small -scale, 1970s-aesthetic alligator processing – a skill rendered economically unviable by the predatory actions of the Meat  Processor Oligarchy. His African features ground him visually, while his Primal Mama upbringing in Lickskillet informs his knowledge , skills, and resentments. He embodies the struggle of the common person against unchecked corporate power in a world where survival  itself is a commodity. His bitterness is a direct result of his values (pride in craftsmanship, self-reliance) cl ashing with the world's harsh realities. His skepticism towards the dominant cultural deities highlights his grounded, cynical perspective shaped by hardship.`
 *   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a living testament to the "friction" caused by the meat processor  oligarchies; to provide a ground-level perspective on life in Lickskillet for those outside the power structures; potentially  a reluctant ally, mentor, or source of critical information/skills for protagonists opposing the oligarchy; a source of conflict if  his bitterness leads him to make desperate choices.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The desire  for justice/revenge vs. the pragmatic need for survival and the overwhelming power of his enemies. Pride in his lost  craft vs. the shame of his current dispossession. The instinct to trust (perhaps in fellow victims or potential allies) vs.  deep-seated suspicion born from betrayal.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be  galvanized into action, moving from bitter resignation to active resistance. Could find a new purpose in teaching his skills or helping others survive . Might reclaim some aspect of his former life or find a measure of peace/justice. Conversely, could descend further into bitterness and  isolation, becoming a more dangerous or tragic figure.`
