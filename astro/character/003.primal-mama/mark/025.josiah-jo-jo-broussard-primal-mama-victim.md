## Introduction: Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of ** Fictional Persons** (characters, significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework , characters **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex,  core narratives). They possess **no independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters  by explicitly authenticating their properties across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence , and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle**, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember  **undersaturation**: define what is essential, acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative Function:

* Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle.*

*    **Core Essence:** `Josiah "Jo-Jo" Broussard is constituted as an embodiment of the Primal Mama world 's working-class struggle, particularly in Lickskillet. He is a man defined by his connection to his  family, his ancestral (though technologically dependent on GE gators and solar tech) farm, and the relentless economic pressure exerted  by the Meat Oligarchy. His existence is a testament to resilience in the face of systemic exploitation, grounded in the world 's 1970s retro-tech aesthetic and bayou culture. He is a victim of the world 's deontic structure (oligarchy power, ineffective local governance) and its axiology (his honest labor is undervalued). `
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To represent the human cost of the Meat Oligarchy's dominance; to provide a  grounded, sympathetic viewpoint character for exploring the socio-economic realities of Lickskillet; to potentially act as a catalyst or  reluctant participant in any narrative arc involving resistance or investigation into the oligarchy's practices. He highlights the disparity between the " incredible source of energy" (solar) and its equitable distribution or benefit.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):**  `Pride in self-sufficiency vs. Crushing weight of debt and dependence on predatory lenders/buyers. Love for family vs.  Fear of failing them. Desire for justice vs. Pragmatic fear of retaliation from the powerful. Hope for future vs. Daily  grind of poverty and exploitation. Distrust of advanced tech (Automatons/LLMs due to stigma) vs. The  potential benefits he's missing.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Josiah could be pushed to  a breaking point, leading to desperate actions (potentially illegal or dangerous). He might become involved with individuals seeking to expose or  challenge the oligarchy (e.g., an Erpenthrope truth-seeker, an investigative journalist from outside L ickskillet). His practical skills could become vital in unexpected circumstances. He could be forced to confront his prejudices (e.g.,  about Automaton users or even Swamp Witches) if they offer an unlikely path to survival or resistance.`
