# Based  on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II.C (Character as Property Bundle)

## Introduction : Constituting Fictional Persons Textually

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of **Fictional Persons** (characters,  significant sentient beings) within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel's framework, characters **ARE** constituted  by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (this Codex, core narratives). They possess **no  independent psyche or reality beyond this textual definition**.*

*Use this template to systematically build characters by explicitly authenticating their properties  across relevant categories. Focus on creating multifaceted individuals whose complexity arises from the **richness, coherence, and potential tensions within their authenticated bundle **, and whose actions are logically grounded in their defined nature and the world's rules. Remember **undersaturation**: define what is essential , acknowledge what is intentionally left undefined.*

### Character Constitution Summary & Narrative  Function:

*Purpose: Synthesize the core identity, internal conflicts, and narrative role emerging from the authenticated property bundle .*

*   **Core Essence:** `Jebediah Cottonmouth is constituted as a proud man broken by the systemic  greed inherent in Primal Mama's meat oligarchy. His identity, once rooted in the self-sufficient,  1970s-aesthetic-driven enterprise of alligator processing—a cornerstone of post-Calamity society—has been violently  stripped away. He is a living testament to the "friction" mentioned in the world's deontic rules, embodying  the struggle of the common swamp-dweller against powerful, corrupt forces. His bitterness is a direct consequence of his legitimate  grievance, and his resilience is a quiet defiance against a world that has devalued his labor and life. He clings to symbols  of a more 'just' past (celebrity deities, memories of honest work) amidst the strange spiritual miasma and  retro-futuristic decay.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To serve as a clear victim and representation of the injustices  perpetrated by the meat oligarchy; a potential catalyst for quests for justice or exposure; a source of grounded, bitter wisdom about the realities  of life in Primal Mama's Lickskillet region; a moral touchstone highlighting the human cost of the world 's power dynamics.`
*   **Key Internal Conflicts (From Bundle):** `The burning desire for his past  life/status vs. the crushing reality of his present poverty; The need to warn others or seek justice vs. the paraly zing fear of further retaliation from the oligarchy; The Southern value of hospitality/community vs. a deep, learned distrust  of everyone.`
*   **Potential for Development (Based on Bundle):** `Could be galvanized by a protagonist to  share his story or aid in a quest against the oligarchy (Functional/Social change); Might find a new, albeit smaller , purpose or community (Psychological/Social change); Could pass on his knowledge of alligator processing or swamp survival (Functional  change); Might succumb further to bitterness or paranoia, or find a measure of peace/acceptance (Psychological change). His  knowledge of the oligarchy's past tactics could be crucial.`
