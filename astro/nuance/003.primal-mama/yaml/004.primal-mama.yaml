introduction: |
  This protocol guides the conscious design of **implicit meaning and guided inference ** within the Primal Mama heterocosm. While Doležel's framework prioritizes explicit textual authentication, it acknowledges  that rich worlds are also built through **strong implication, consistent patterns, and the necessary inferences** readers draw from established rules  and facts.

  Use this document to strategically plan where direct authentication is needed, where meaning can be effectively implied, what inferences  are crucial for audience understanding, and where ambiguity serves a specific purpose. This refines the texture and depth of your world -building, particularly in illustrating the lived experience of its unique rules.

section_i:
  title: " Explicit Authentication vs. Implicit Authentication"
  purpose: "To differentiate between facts stated directly versus those strongly implied by consistent textual evidence , demonstrated through a specific scene."
  world_element_rule:
    name: "The Societal Stigma  and Practical Distrust of Automaton/LLM Users Outside Elite Circles (specifically in Lickskillet)."
     explicit_authentications:
      - "- Rule DEO-003 (Coherence Protocol): Individuals who utilize Automat ons and Large Language Models...suffer a discernible \"stain on their reputation.\" This implies social ostracization,  distrust, or other negative social consequences."
      - "- Rule AXI-008 (Coherence Protocol): Aut onomy vs. Automation: A tension exists, where self-reliance (mom-and-pop, guns) might be  implicitly valued over reliance on \"impersonal\" Automatons/LLMs."
      - "- Rule TEC-001 (Co herence Protocol - Implied by Aesthetic Constraint): The late 1970s design aesthetic for all tech might foster  a cultural preference for analog, hands-on processes, making purely digital/AI interfaces feel alien or untrustworthy."

          details: |
            Jed Rimes needs a rare hydro-spanner schematic for his aging fanboat. The usual  human parts brokers in Lickskillet have shrugged. Reluctantly, he approaches "Data-Dave," a known  LLM-terminal operator working from a grimy, wood-paneled booth at the edge of the market. Dave 's terminal is a chunky, beige plastic affair with a flickering amber monochrome screen and a clunky keyboard.
            As Jed approaches , two other swampers waiting for a different (human) broker noticeably create more distance, one muttering just loud enough for  Jed to hear, "Smells like ozone and bad ideas over there."
            Data-Dave, a pale man with oversized  glasses, speaks in a slightly too-precise, uninflected tone. When he finds the schematic (displayed in blocky , 70s-style graphics), he prints it on a noisy dot-matrix printer. The transaction is quick, but  Jed feels a prickle of unease, unrelated to the cost.
            The human broker at the next stall, a  woman named Mama Sass, who normally banters with Jed, gives him a curt nod and a look that mixes pity with disapproval as  he walks away with the printout. She then loudly offers another customer a "real, hand-drawn" map,  emphasizing the word "real."
        - type: "Environmental Storytelling:"
          details: |
            Data -Dave's booth is isolated, tucked away near the refuse bins. While functional, it lacks the personal touches (char ms, photos of deified celebrities, quirky hand-painted signs) common to other Lickskillet vendor stalls. 
            The air around Dave's booth has a faint, sharp electronic smell (from the old terminal) that contrasts with  the usual Lickskillet scents of swamp water, fried gator, and diesel.
    design_intent: "To show , not just tell, the social cost and ingrained cultural distrust of LLM users in a community like Lickskillet.  It makes the abstract \"stain on reputation\" a tangible social experience for Jed and the audience, reinforcing the world' s unique values without needing an explicit narrator voiceover saying \"People in Lickskillet don't trust LLM users .\""

section_ii:
  title: "Textually Licensed Inferences (Guiding the Audience)"
   purpose: "To identify key inferences the audience *must* make for the world/plot to function, ensuring the necessary premises are clearly  authenticated."
  required_inference:
    name: "Using Data-Dave's LLM service, while  effective, marks Jed as someone willing to engage with \"unnatural\" or socially suspect means, potentially impacting his reputation or future interactions  within the Lickskillet community."
    authenticated_premises:
      - "- Fact: Explicit rule of \"stain on  reputation\" for Automaton/LLM users (DEO-003)."
      - "- Observed Behavior: Other  swampers' avoidance and negative comments directed at/around Data-Dave's stall."
      - "- Observed Behavior: Mama  Sass's coldness and pointed emphasis on \"real, hand-drawn\" alternatives, implying Dave's output is  somehow less legitimate or trustworthy."
      - "- Jed's internal unease: Despite getting what he needed, he  doesn't feel good about the transaction, sensing the social disapproval."
      - "- Cultural Value: The high value placed on  self-reliance and \"grit\" in Lickskillet (AXI-008, implied by gun ownership norms  and mom-and-pop pride)."
    narrative_function: "Establishes the subtle social pressures and consequences  of technological choices within Primal Mama. It shows that even \"functional\" advanced tech (within the 70s  aesthetic) isn't automatically accepted if it violates cultural norms. It can also serve as a setup for future plot points if  Jed's association with Dave causes him problems."
    clarity_check:
      question: "Are the premises supporting this  inference clearly and consistently authenticated through the scene's description?"
      answer: "Yes, the reactions of other characters  and Jed's own feelings clearly signal the negative social judgment."

section_iii:
  title: "Strategic Ambiguity  & Polysemy (Intentional Gaps & Multiple Meanings)"
  purpose: "To consciously design areas where  meaning is deliberately left open, uncertain, or multi-layered, serving specific narrative or thematic goals."
  area_of_amb iguity:
    name: "The *precise origin and full extent* of the anti-Automaton/LLM  cultural programming or belief."
    authenticated_facts:
      - "The stigma exists and is socially enforced in places like Lick skillet."
      - "The technology functions (Data-Dave gets the schematic)."
      - "All technology must conform to  a late 1970s design aesthetic."
      - "The biological calamity drastically reshaped society."
     intentionally_unauthenticated:
      title: "Intentionally Unauthenticated (within this scene and potentially broader lore):"
       points:
        - "Is the stigma a direct result of the calamity (e.g., \"thinking machines\" were  blamed, or their \"unnatural logic\" is seen as kindred to whatever caused the biological chaos)?"
        -  "Is it a form of Luddism, a cultural reaction to preserve \"human\" skills and ingenuity in a world where  so much has been lost or altered?"
        - "Is it actively promoted by certain factions (e.g., the meat olig archy, or even the \"invisible women\" of conspiracy, to keep the populace less informed or reliant on controlled information channels)?" 
        - "Is it tied to the deified celebrities – perhaps their personas embody a \"simpler, more direct\" way of  being that clashes with AI?"
    narrative_thematic_function: "The ambiguity allows the stigma to serve multiple  thematic purposes: critiques of technophobia, explorations of societal control, reflections on what \"humanity\" means in this world. It makes  the world feel more real, as societal taboos often have complex, unstated, or forgotten origins. It also allows  for character-specific interpretations (Jed just thinks it's \"unnatural,\" another might have a more elaborate conspiracy theory )."
    boundary_of_ambiguity: "While the *why* is ambiguous, the *effect* of the  stigma (social ostracization, distrust) is clearly authenticated and consistently portrayed in the scene. Data-Dave is marginalized , Jed feels the pressure."

section_iv:
  title: "Managing Genre Conventions & Minimal Departure"
   purpose: "To be aware of how genre conventions and the reader's default assumptions interact with explicit and implicit authentication ."
  relevant_genres: "Primal Mama: Bayou-infused Retro-Futurism, Southern Gothic,  Bio-Punk."
  convention_assumption:
    name: "Sci-Fi/Retro-Futurism: Often  involves advanced information technology. Default AW assumption: Computers/AI are generally accepted tools if available."
    primal_mama_ alignment_subversion:
      alignment: "Information technology (LLM terminal) exists and is functional."
      subversion : "Despite functionality and adherence to the 1970s aesthetic, this specific form of advanced tech (AI /LLMs) faces strong cultural resistance and social stigma in many parts of society. This contrasts with the acceptance of other advanced tech  like genetic engineering (GE alligators) or sophisticated solar power."
    authentication_strategy: "The scene explicitly shows both the  LLM's functionality (Jed gets his schematic) AND the social friction it causes. This juxtaposition highlights the unique Primal Mama  rule, deviating from a simple \"tech is good/bad\" binary. The 1970s aesthetic further  complicates this by making the \"advanced\" tech look archaic to an AW audience, yet still \"too much\" for some Primal Mama  inhabitants."
  minimal_departure_management:
    awareness: "Readers will assume that if a tool is useful , people will generally use it without major social penalty (AW default)."
    strategy: "The scene *explicitly authenticates  the deviation* from this AW norm. Jed's need for the schematic (utility) is pitted against the observed social cost. This  makes the world's specific deontic rule (DEO-003) feel earned and impactful rather than arbitrary ."
    grounding: "The use of a recognizable setting (a market, a parts broker) grounds the unusual social dynamic." 

conclusion: |
  This protocol highlights that constructing a compelling heterocosm involves mastering not only explicit authentication but also the subtle  arts of **implication, guided inference, and strategic ambiguity**. The scene with Jed at the Lickskillet Parts Exchange demonstrates  how these principles can bring a world rule like "Automaton/LLM user stigma" to life, making it a palpable  social reality rather than an abstract decree.

  By consciously designing how information is revealed – directly stated (the rule),  strongly suggested (the swampers' reactions), logically necessitated (Jed's inference of social risk), or intentionally obscured (the  ultimate *why* of the stigma) – the creator acts as a sophisticated semantic architect, guiding the audience through the complex , layered reality of Primal Mama. This nuanced approach allows for both structural integrity and profound imaginative space, making the weirdness  of Primal Mama feel strangely, compellingly real.
