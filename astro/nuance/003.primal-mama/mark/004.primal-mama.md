# Character Snapshot: Jedediah "Jed " Rimes

**World:** Primal Mama
**Role:** Independent Gator Hauler / Occasional Scavenger 
**Age:** Late 40s
**Appearance:** Wiry, sun-weathered skin, faded denim overalls  often patched with alligator hide, a trucker cap advertising "Burt's Best Bait & Tackle" (a fictional establishment  revering Burt Reynolds). Always carries a well-maintained, but visibly old, lever-action rifle.
**Personality :** Laconic, pragmatic, deeply suspicious of Beetriot "elites" and complex technology he doesn't understand.  Believes in hard work, straight talk, and the wisdom of the swamp. Adherent to the "common sense" version  of the celebrity deities â€“ e.g., "What would Jerry do?" when faced with a tricky situation needing quick thinking.
** Notable Beliefs:**
*   Firmly believes cattle flesh is poison, both physically and morally.
*   Mild ly subscribes to the "invisible women" conspiracy, blaming them for things like unfair gator prices or unexpected storms,  but not obsessively.
*   Views Automatons/LLMs with deep distrust, seeing them as "unnatural" and  a way for "city folk to get lazy and lose their grit."
*   Respects Erpenthropes  from a distance, viewing them as powerful and ancient forces of nature, best left to their own devices unless they interfere with  his livelihood.
