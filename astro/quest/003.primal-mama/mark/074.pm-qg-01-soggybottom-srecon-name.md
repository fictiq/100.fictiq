Okay, let's re-skin and re- contextualize the Velen quest flow using the established rules and atmosphere of the Primal Mama world.

# Pr imal Mama: Gator Stompin' Grounds - Bayou Recon & Access Protocol

**Location:** The Soggy Bottoms Sector  (Adjacent to Lickskillet Outskirts)
**Codex Version:** PM-QG-0.1
**Auth ored:** [Your Name/Studio Name]

---

## Arrival: The Soggy Bottoms Welcome

Your air boat sputters to a halt near **"Snaggletooth Point"**, a grim landmark festooned with weathered  gator skulls and faded warning signs – likely marking territory disputes between mom-and-pop outfits and the ever-present **G atorCorp Oligarchy**. This stretch of bayou is contested territory, caught between the processing plants of Lickskillet further  downstream and the murky, untamed wilds feeding into the **Saurian Sanctuary**. Evidence of conflict – discarded shell casings, hastily  patched levees, the occasional scent of burnt fuel – hangs thick in the humid air, heavier than the drone of mutant  insects.

Boot up your trusty **Scan-O-Matic 5000™** (all beige plastic  and chunky buttons, naturally) and check the local threat assessment. The immediate vicinity seems manageable – packs of mutated **F eral Swamp Hounds** (Level 1-2), maybe some surprisingly vicious **Vampire Bunnies** ( Level 2) drawn by the refuse near the Point. But the Scan-O-Matic's flickering CRT warns of escalating  dangers. A short jaunt north into the cypress groves reveals nests of chittering **Lesser Swamp Ghouls ** (Level 6) – wretched things, possibly mutated remnants of Calamity victims. Further north, near the old  water channels, expect **Feral GE Gators** (Level 9, escaped or mis-engineered stock) and territorial  **Mutated Snapping Turtles** (Level 11) lurking beneath the scum. For a Level 4 Swamp  Runner with a standard-issue Gator Prod and a well-oiled shotgun, these encounters push the limits. Deeper east , amidst glowing fungal islands, rumors speak of a rogue, heavily modified **Oligarchy Maintenance Automaton** (Level  20+) gone feral.

Bottom line: charging blindly through the Soggy Bottoms like you owned the place is  a quick way to become gator chow or ghoul fertilizer. We need to navigate smartly, pick our fights, and maybe backtrack  when the Scan-O-Matic screams bloody murder.

## Crossing the Channel: Accessing Lickskillet Restricted  Zones

You've likely noticed the imposing silhouette of **Lickskillet**'s processing towers downstream, maybe  even caught the distant gleam of **Beetriot**'s elite habitat domes far to the north-east. Problem  is, getting closer means crossing the main shipping channel, and the **GatorCorp Oligarchy Enforcers** have  checkpoints tighter than a drum on all the maintained bridges and ferry landings. Reasons to get past? Access to specialized **Parts  Vendors** (for that vintage 70s tech), **Masterwork Gator-Hide Tailors**, maybe even underground  **Swamp Witch apothecaries**, and rumors of high-stakes "Gator-Tooth" betting pools. So , how do we bypass the goons in their suspiciously clean, Oligarchy-branded jumpsuits?

First, the direct  approach: **Swimming**. The channel water is likely thick with processing runoff and things best left undisturbed, but if you're tough  (maybe got a bit of that **Erpenthrope resilience**?) and don't mind the smell clinging for  days, it's an option. Just watch out for those Feral Gators and maybe worse things lurking below.

Alternatively,  we can grease some palms or do some favors. This involves navigating the local network of favors, threats, and desperation.

Start  by following the rickety boardwalk north from **Snaggletooth Point**. Ignore the first path leading into the deeper swamp for  now (unless you want to clear out a nest, see **"Ghoul Den Clearing"** below). When the path forks again , head north-west towards a cluster of makeshift stilt-huts clinging to a slightly drier patch of land – a known  haunt for **Bayou Black Marketeers** and other independent operators. South of here stretches a hazardous **Calamity De bris Field**, while north is a heavily guarded Oligarchy checkpoint controlling access to a major supply levee leading towards Lickskillet  proper. Getting past that checkpoint is our ticket closer to the action.

### Ghoul Den Clearing (Level 6  Recommended)

If you're feeling froggy, take that first side path west from the main boardwalk north of Snaggletooth . It winds deeper into the mangroves before passing a collapsed pre-Calamity structure – now a **Lesser Swamp Gh oul Den** (Level 6). These things hunt in packs, gibbering and clawing. They're fast  but fragile; aggressive tactics with a shotgun or well-aimed Gator Prod strikes work well. Try not to get surrounded  in the muck.

Clear out the ghouls milling outside. Loot a rusty footlocker half-submerged west  of the entrance. Clamber onto some precarious scaffolding north of the main hole to find another stash box. Further south, across  a dangerously rotten wooden bridge spanning a sludge-filled ditch, more salvage awaits the sure-footed.

Head into the den itself  – likely a series of interconnected concrete tunnels from whatever structure this used to be. Keep your Scan-O-Matic handy for  movement pings. Check a side alcove to the north for crates and a potential schematic cache – maybe plans for ** "Tough-Hide" Armor Augments** (level 27 needed, requires Enhanced base plans, but good  to file away).

Follow the main tunnel as it curves. Take out another pack of Ghouls in a larger central  chamber. Loot a container along the northern wall. There might be a makeshift platform with another chest above it. Check an eastern alc ove for a final salvage opportunity before heading back out.

### Scavenger Camp Raid (Level 10 Recommended)

 Don't let the level rating spook you; patience and cover are key. North and slightly east of the Ghoul Den ( or accessible from the main boardwalk route) lies a known **Scavenger Camp**. You might first encounter lookouts on jury -rigged swamp skimmers (Level 7). Try using a **Sonic Stunner** gadget (if you have  one) to disorient them, or just blast them off their rides with buckshot. Finishing downed opponents quickly is advised .

Proceed towards the main camp marker. The Scavengers on foot (Levels 9-10) are better  armed, often with salvaged Oligarchy gear. Use cover, wait for openings after their attacks (ripostes if you' re skilled with a machete), and keep your own **Personal Energy Shield™** (flickering, belt-mounted device ) charged. They hit hard but aren't overly quick.

Once they're dealt with, find the **Sc avenger Boss** (likely the one with the biggest gun or crudest power armor pieces). Loot them for a **Mag -Lock Override Key** (chunky, 70s style). Use it on the nearby cage holding a terrified -looking **Independent Merchant**. He’ll thank you profusely and mention setting up shop near the Oligarchy checkpoint camp ( our destination), promising "deals" (likely overpriced junk, but maybe useful components). Grab the **Audio Log** ( cassette tape) near the Boss's usual spot – detailing plans to fence salvaged tech and complain about someone named ' Brenda'. Right. North of the cage, check containers for salvage, including a potentially valuable locked chest. Once done, find  the main path north-west, navigating through the Calamity Debris Field towards the checkpoint camp and the looming Olig archy levee.

### Thou Shalt Not Pass (Level 7 Interaction)

Approach the checkpoint bridge. Olig archy Enforcers, looking bored but alert, will halt you. They make it clear: no **GatorCorp Access Permit **, no passage. They might make sneering comments about independent "Swamp Rats" or your lack of proper "Corporate  Sanitation Seals." You can try:

*   **Bribe:** Offer a hefty amount of **Solar Cells** or  high-grade **Processed Gator Rations** (10 units?). (Gain 1 XP per 10 units value  offered – not efficient XP gain).
*   **Persuade/Bluff (Requires Charm/Deception Skill or  maybe invoking Burt Reynolds' name as a blessing):** Try to talk your way through, maybe claiming you have urgent delivery  for a foreman in Lickskillet.
*   **Inquire:** Ask politely how one *obtains* a  permit. They'll grumble about needing official Oligarchy paperwork or finding someone "connected" who deals in such things. This  starts the quest **"Permit Procurement."**

**Objective:** `For using Persuasion/Bluff successfully on the  Enforcer: 25 XP`

### Fake Permits

Return to the stilt-hut camp south of the checkpoint . Look for a nervous individual hunched over a flickering dataslate – the **Bayou Black Marketeer**. He'll offer a  forged GatorCorp Access Permit, but the price is steep: 100 Solar Cells. Ouch. Options:

*    **Pay:** Fork over the 100 Cells.
*   **Persuade/Intimidate (Requires  Delusion Level 1 / High Intimidation):** Try to haggle or subtly threaten him. Maybe mention you  know people who know people, or flash a (fake?) Erpenthrope gang sign. Might get the price down  to 50 Cells.
*   **Work-for-Discount:** Play broke. He'll sigh and offer a deal . His associate is out scavenging valuable **Bio-Luminescent Fungi** from the nearby Calamity Debris Field,  but the place is crawling with Ghouls and Feral Gators. Protect the scavenger, and the permit price drops significantly . This starts the quest **"Fungus Field Escort."** Given the potential for salvage and XP, this  is probably the best route.

**Objective:** `For using Persuasion/Intimidation successfully on the Marketeer: 4 0 XP`

### Fungus Field Escort (Level 9 Recommended)

Head south into the sprawling Calamity De bris Field. Use your Scan-O-Matic to locate the scavenger, **Albin** – you might need to clear a few  Feral Gators (Level 9) first. Talk to Albin; he’s jumpy but direct. He needs  protection while his crew harvests the glowing fungi. Agree to help.

Find a defensible spot amidst the wreckage and wait.  Several waves of swamp threats will attack, drawn by the activity and the fungi's glow:
*   Wave 1:  3 Swamp Ghouls (Level 7)
*   Wave 2: 3 Swamp Ghouls (Level 7 )
*   Wave 3: 1 **Bloat-Sac Ghoul** (Level 8, explodes  on death – keep distance!) + 2 Swamp Ghouls (Level 7)
*   Wave 4:  3 Feral Gators (Level 9)

Focus on protecting Albin and his crew – the creatures will prioritize the  living targets. Use area-effect tools if you have them (Molotovs, maybe an Igni-like mini -flamer gadget).

After the last wave, check on the survivors. Talk to Albin. Depending on how many of  his crew survived, he'll reward you with 20, 50, 70, or 100  Solar Cells, plus 50 XP. Return to the Black Marketeer. If Albin survived, the Marketeer will gratefully  offer the forged permit for only 25 Cells. If Albin *died*, the Marketeer becomes hostile, refuses  the deal, and even Persuasion attempts might fail to secure the permit (though you might still get the XP for trying ).

**Objective:** `For successfully defending the scavengers: 50 XP`
**Reward:** `20 -  100 Solar Cells`

If you failed to get a permit here, or just want another option, check the makeshift  **Bounty Board** near the checkpoint camp. Look for a notice titled **"Contract: Bayou Raider."** Talk  to the nearby **Oligarchy Foreman** (likely lounging near an idling airboat). He’ll complain about some  "critter" or swamp bandits raiding supply barges moving towards Lickskillet. He offers Solar Cells and an official ( temporary) Access Permit for dealing with the problem. Sounds promising.

### Hungry Kids (Level 4 Encounter)

While  exploring south-west of the checkpoint camp, follow a side path. If the path splits, keep heading generally west.  You might spot an old, half-sunken house boat with a quest marker. Approach, deal with a couple of  Feral Swamp Hounds (Level 4) nosing around, and you'll hear kids whispering inside. Co ax them out. They're war orphans or abandoned kids, survivors of the harsh Soggy Bottoms life. Ask about their  parents (sad stories likely). You can offer:
*   Solar Cells (might make them a target).
*   Food  (Processed Gator Jerky or similar rations).
*   Nothing.

Giving food seems kindest. If you happen  to have read a salvaged copy of **"Swamp Critters & How to Skin 'Em Vol. 3"**, you might  gain bestiary entries for local mutated fauna and perhaps a recipe for **"Swamp Tea Poultice."**

**Objective:**  `For giving the children aid: 10 XP`
**Reward:** `Maybe a crude hand-carved g ator tooth charm?`

### Contract: Bayou Raider (Level 6 Recommended)

Follow the road south-west from  the checkpoint camp until you find the quest marker area east of the path. Head into the overgrown swamp. You might encounter  a pair of **Alpha Swamp Ghouls** (Level 5, tougher variants, maybe use corrosive spit?). Use Ig ni-gadget or strong attacks, dodging their lunges. Activate your Scan-O-Matic near the wrecked supply  barge indicated. Examining the damage and discarded casings suggests this wasn't random wildlife.

Scan for tracks, then follow the trail south . The search area updates. Follow the tracks south-west, across a shallow stream (watch for leeches!), and up  a muddy bank. Soon, you'll be hailed – figures emerge from the foliage, armed with salvaged rifles and bows. They  look like hardened **Bayou Freefolk**, independent swamp dwellers known for resisting Oligarchy control. They're suspicious. 

Options:
1.  **Agree to Parley:** Lower your weapon, agree to be escorted (maybe temporarily  disarmed) to meet their leader.
2.  **Pick a Fight:** Make hostile moves, insult their reverence  for Gram Parsons (a known Freefolk patron saint), or claim you're just sightseeing.

Choosing option 2 means  fighting several Freefolk Fighters (Level 5) and their leader, perhaps **Vernossiel** (Level 9 , skilled sniper). Even if you plan to fight later, choosing option 1 now is safer.

Meeting the leader, you  get more choices:
*   **Fight:** Attack them (unarmed if they took your weapons!). Tough fight.
*    **Agree to Leave:** Promise to forget you saw them and leave them be. They might offer a small token reward  for your discretion (seeing you as potentially non-hostile).
*   **Negotiate?** (Requires high  Speech/Charm) Maybe try to understand their motives? Unlikely to change the immediate outcome much.

If you choose to  leave peacefully, they give you a reward (maybe useful herbs, swamp navigation charts?). Now, you can:
*   **Return  to Foreman, Report Freefolk:** Lie and say you couldn't find the raiders, or tattle on the Free folk's location. Tattling gets you the Access Permit but likely *no* Solar Cells (Foreman might  claim the info is payment enough).
*   **Return to Foreman, Report Killed Raiders:** After agreeing to leave the  Freefolk peacefully, sneak back, ambush them, loot their camp (including leader's gear), then return to the Foreman  claiming you eliminated the threat. This gets you the full reward (Permit + Cells) from the Foreman, who mus es darkly about needing harsher measures against the "swamp trash." You also get whatever loot you took from the Freefolk  camp. This is the double-crossing, morally dubious route.

**Objective:** `For promising to leave the Freefolk alone:  Reward (e.g., Rare Herbs, Salvaged Components, 6x Gator Hides)`
**Objective:** `For  telling the Foreman the Freefolk's location: 25 XP, GatorCorp Access Permit`
**Objective:**  `For telling the Foreman you killed the Freefolk: 25 XP, 30 Solar Cells, GatorCorp  Access Permit`

---

## Access Granted

One way or another, you should now possess a valid (or forged ) **GatorCorp Access Permit**. Return to the Oligarchy checkpoint. Flash the permit (or the convincingly forged replica ) at the Enforcers. They'll wave you through with a grunt. This permit should also grant basic access through similar  low-level checkpoints around Lickskillet and potentially the outer markers for Oxenfurt (if that's a location  in your Primal Mama).

Now's a good time to explore the newly accessible areas cautiously. Find airboat travel points  (signposts), look for merchants hawking salvaged 70s tech or gator parts, challenge locals to " Gator-Tooth" (if that's your Gwent equivalent), and visit **Gator-Hide Tailors** or  **Scrap-Metal Smiths**. Lickskillet itself might hold more immediate quests or dangers, so maybe stick to the outskirts  and connecting routes first if you want to avoid triggering major plot points prematurely.

**Objective:** `For showing the guard  your valid permit: 75 XP`

## Gear Scavenging: Gator-Prod Upgrade

Before  diving deeper into the main investigation (tracking those aggressive GE Gators), there's some potentially useful gear to scavenge. We  need schematics for a better melee weapon.

### Death by Fire (Level 10 Encounter)

From the Olig archy checkpoint, head back south-east across the channel, follow the path past the stilt-village turn-off, and  back towards Snaggletooth Point. Continue east along an unexplored track until you find some rough-looking **Oligarchy  Thugs** standing around a burning stilt-house. Approach, and they'll brag about "teaching a lesson"  to someone who didn't pay their "protection fee."

Options:
1.  **Leave:** Walk away, let  them finish their grim work.
2.  **Intervene:** Stand up for the victim. Prepare for a fight with  the Thugs (Level 10).

If you intervene, take down the Thugs. Then, quickly use a  crowbar or strong kick (maybe an Aard-like sonic pulse gadget) to break down the jammed door of the burning house . Smoke inhalation is a real danger (timer mechanic like drowning). An **elderly Swamp Witch apprentice** stumbles out, coughing . Loot a shelf inside quickly before getting out yourself. Talk to the apprentice outside. Grateful, she'll tell you about  a hidden stash of valuable herbs and components she can no longer safely keep. She departs into the swamp. Loot the Th ugs – one might have **Reinforced Workman Boots** (Relic quality, likely an upgrade).

**Objective:** `For  saving the apprentice: 25 XP`

### Feral Gator Nest (Level 6)

Follow the path  east from the burning house until it branches south near some old quarry signs (**"Sulfur Gulch Quarry"** signpost ). Ignore the quarry for now, backtrack slightly north, and follow the path north-east until it crosses another decaying track. To  the west is a dilapidated bridge over a murky stream. Climb down and follow the stream north to find a **Feral Gator Nest**  (Level 6), guarded by several juvenile Ferals. Clear them out, use explosives or a strong Igni- gadget charge to destroy the nest mound, and loot a nearby waterlogged chest.

**Objective:** `For destroying the F eral Gator Nest: 20 XP`

### Abandoned Watchtower (Level 7 Nest & Level 9 /11 Guards)

Climb back onto the path, head south-west across the rickety bridge remnants,  and follow the track until it ends at another collapsed bridge section falling into the swamp. Carefully make your way across the swamp to the north  where the path continues on higher ground leading towards a ruined pre-Calamity watchtower (**"Lookout Point Zulu "** signpost). Beware of **Mist Lurkers** (Level 4, Foglet equivalent) that phase in and out of  the fog – use wide-area Igni bursts or sonic pulses (Yrden equivalent?) to reveal them.

Cl oser to the tower island, you'll encounter tougher threats: **Adolescent Feral Gators** (Level  9) and hulking **Alpha Feral Gators** (Level 11). The Alphas are dangerous, potentially  with armored hides or a venomous bite (Quen-shield recommended!). Try to isolate them. Hit them with  3 strong Gator Prod strikes, dodge their predictable lunge/tail swipe, repeat. It takes time at lower levels.

Once  the area is clear, find an entrance to the tower base near the signpost. Loot containers on the ground floor ( your reward for dealing with the Gators). Near a blocked gate, find a waterlogged note: **"Security Memo 77 -B: Containment Breach."**

Go up the crumbling stairs to an exterior platform. Deal with a flock of aggressive  **Mutated Vultures** (Levels 5-7, Harpy equivalent). Their nest is near the stairs –  destroy it (explosives/Igni). East of the nest, through a collapsed doorway, find a skeleton slumped against  a wall. Search it for **Schematic: Solar-Charged Gator Prod** and a crumpled **"Technician's Final  Log."** Reading the log starts the scavenger hunt **"Relics of the Old Techs: Prod Division."** A  nearby chest contains miscellaneous salvage and **"Chief Engineer Wallace's Confession"** (audio log on tape).

**Objective :** `For destroying the Mutated Vulture Nest: 20 XP`

The next schematic piece is guarded by something  nastier, but the potential weapon upgrade is significant. Proceed only if confident or feeling lucky. If not, skip ahead  to your main objective tracking the aggressive GE Gators.

### Hidden Stash: Pre-Calamity Payday (Level 1 2 Recommended)

Activate the **"Lookout Point Zulu"** signpost and fast travel (if possible via airboat routes ) back to the **Oligarchy Checkpoint** signpost. From there, take your airboat (or swim  carefully) west to a small, muddy island marked by a perpetually burning pyre of discarded bio-waste. Lovely. Some  **Lesser Swamp Ghouls** (Level 6) might be scavenging here; dispatch them. Find the Hidden  Stash marker – a dead **Smuggler** near a collapsed comms tower. Search him for a **Secure  Container Keycard** (70s style, punch holes) and a **Data Cassette** labeled "Pickup Instructions ," starting the quest **"Things Folks Do For Solar Cells..."**. Read the instructions (if you have a working player). Follow  the trail south – towards the burning pyre. Use a fire extinguisher gadget or maybe dump a load of swamp water to  temporarily douse the flames (Aard equivalent). Search near some warped metal debris to find the secure container. Unlock it for  valuable salvage (high-grade components, maybe pre-Calamity currency?).

### Rot-Fly Nest (Level 6 )

Take your airboat/swim west again to another island showing signs of a derelict camp. Now it hosts  a **Rot-Fly Nest**. Rot-Flies (Level 6, Rotfiend equivalent) are mutated insects  that swell and explode violently when near death. When one starts pulsing and glowing, back off fast! Igni-gadgets work well .

Clear the buzzing guardians, then destroy the pulsating nest mound (explosives/Igni). A larger **Queen  Rot-Fly** (Level 5, but tougher) might emerge. It explodes into a toxic gas cloud upon death,  so finish it from range (shotgun, crossbow, thrown explosives). Loot the nest remnants. Search the derelict camp for salvage , including a potentially valuable chest near the water's edge north of the nest site.

**Objective:** `For destroying  the Rot-Fly Nest: 20 XP`

### Calamity Cache (Level 4)

Leave  the Rot-Fly island and head south-west, navigating by Scan-O-Matic towards a "Salvage Opportunity " marker in the deeper water channel. Dive down (hold your breath!) to find two sealed pre-Calamity  crates resting on the silty bottom. You might be harassed by **Mutated Eels** (Level 4, Drow ner equivalent) – use an underwater spear gun or harpoon attachment if you have one. Loot the chests, surface, and continue  swimming/boating west. **Important:** Avoid the large island immediately south – scans show a territorial **Apex Feral Gator** ( Level 18, Forktail equivalent) patrols the northern ridge. Don't become a snack. Aim for the * next* island further west.
