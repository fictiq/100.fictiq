## Introduction: Defining Dynamic Potential Through  Authentication

*This protocol guides the definition of the **functional properties** of quests within the Primal Mama heterocosm. These properties  define the quest's potential for player action, interaction, narrative progression, and influence within the world's established rules ( modalities). They encompass **objectives, key interactions, success/failure states, rewards,** and crucial **constraints  or requirements**.*

*Focus on **authenticating** these functions clearly and consistently. Define not just *what* the quest is  about, but *how* it unfolds, under *what conditions*, with *what potential outcomes*, and crucially, *how  it integrates with established world lore and modalities*. These properties are essential for narrative mechanics, conflict generation, player agency, and world coherence .*

### Authenticated Functional Properties Bundle:

 **1. Core Function / Purpose:**
   *Purpose: Define the primary intended or actualized function of the quest within the  world system.*
    *   `- Primary Role: To immerse the player in the socio-economic tensions of Primal Mama by highlighting  the conflict between mom-and-pop alligator farmers and the encroaching influence of the Meat Oligarchy. It showcases the world 's unique blend of advanced biotech (GE Alligators) and the imposed 1970s technological aesthetic, and  introduces key character archetypes (struggling farmer, enigmatic Swamp Witch).` # Auth: [PrimalMama_ Coherence_v0.1_Deontic_Axiological]
    *   `- Secondary Role( s): Provide an opportunity for the player to make choices with tangible local consequences, build reputation with Lickskillet locals  or gain insight into GatorCorp's methods. Introduce the concept of technological sabotage masked as other issues. Allow interaction with the supernatural  elements (Swamp Witch) in a practical problem-solving context.` # Auth: [PrimalMama_Coherence_v 0.1_Axiological_Epistemic]

**2. Key Capabilities & Powers (Player Actions /  Quest Objectives):**
   *Purpose: Define what the player *can* actively do to progress the quest.*
     *   `- Capability ID: FUNC-QGBS-01`
        *   *Name:* ` Investigate Distressed Gators`
        *   *Description:* `Player is tasked by Mama Agnes, a Lickskillet g ator farmer, to discover why her prize GE Alligators are failing to hold their solar charge and exhibiting unusual sluggishness or  aggression. Player uses observational skills (Witcher Senses-equivalent: "Swamp Sense") to examine the gators  and their enclosure.`
        *   *Authentication:* `Visual cues on gators (dimmed chromatophores, unusual attachments ), environmental clues.`
        *   *Limits/Nuances:* `Initial examination may yield confusing or misleading data (e.g ., appearing like a biological ailment or simple malfunction).`
    *   `- Capability ID: FUNC-QGBS- 02`
        *   *Name:* `Consult Local Experts`
        *   *Description:* `Player seeks  advice. Mama Agnes suggests Mambo Shula, a local Swamp Witch, due to the "unnatural" feel of the problem . Player can also try talking to a local (stigmatized) Automaton mechanic if they suspect tech, though the mechanic  may be unhelpful or fearful.`
        *   *Authentication:* `Dialogue with Mama Agnes. Mambo Shula 's known esoteric knowledge. Automaton mechanic's social standing.`
        *   *Limits/Nuances:* ` Mambo Shula speaks in riddles or demands a small favor (e.g., a rare herb, a shiny  bauble). Automaton mechanic is hesitant to get involved due to stigma.`

        *   *Description:*  `Guided by clues (e.g., Mambo Shula pointing out non-70s tech, or player 's own deduction), player discovers a small, sophisticated device attached to the gators' solar absorption arrays or internal bio-batter ies. The device's design is too sleek, too modern, violating the 1970s aesthetic constraint .`
        *   *Authentication:* `Device is visually distinct. Swamp Sense highlights it as anomalous. Possible interaction with it  yields diagnostic data (if player has tech skill) or Mambo Shula can "read" its intent.`
        *    *Limits/Nuances:* `Device might have a minor countermeasure (small shock, temporary disorientation).`
     *   `- Capability ID: FUNC-QGBS-04`
        *   *Name:* `Trace  Device Origin`
        *   *Description:* `Player investigates the origin of the device. This could involve: finding  a discarded shipping manifest with a GatorCorp shell company logo nearby, Mambo Shula identifying residual "corporate magic" ( i.e., bad juju from soulless entities), or tracking faint energy signatures back to a hidden drop point  used by a GatorCorp agent.`
        *   *Authentication:* `Physical evidence, magical "scrying" by Sh ula, or following electronic/energy trails with Swamp Sense.`
        *   *Limits/Nuances:* `Evidence  trail may be deliberately obscured or lead through dangerous swamp territory (vampire bunnies, wild gators).`
    *   `-  Capability ID: FUNC-QGBS-05`
        *   *Name:* `Confront GatorCorp Agent /  Resolve Situation`
        *   *Description:* `Player confronts a low-level GatorCorp "field technician" or  enforcer responsible for placing the devices. Player has multiple resolution paths:`
            *   `1. Intimidation/Pers uasion: Convince/threaten the agent to remove devices and provide a counter-measure or compensation for Mama Agnes.` 
            *   `2. Combat: Fight the agent (who might have a stun baton or a less-le thal 70s-style energy weapon, or even a "leashed" small, aggressive gator).`
             *   `3. Sabotage Reversal: With Mambo Shula's help or player's own  tech/magic skill, disable or reverse-engineer the devices (potentially creating a jury-rigged 70s-style counter ).`
            *   `4. Report to Ineffective Local Authority: Leading to minimal or no real consequence for GatorCorp but  perhaps some local sympathy.`
        *   *Authentication:* `Dialogue system, combat mechanics, crafting/ritual mechanics.`

### Quest Functional Profile Summary & Narrative Role:

 *Purpose: Synthesize the quest's dynamic potential and its function within the narrative system.*

*   **Core Functional Identity:**  `Gator Bait and Switch functions as an introductory investigation into the underbelly of Primal Mama's primary food source, forcing  the player to navigate local grievances, esoteric swamp wisdom, and corporate malfeasance, all while constrained by the world' s peculiar technological and social rules. It's a microcosm of the world's core conflicts.`
*   ** Key Narrative Functions Served:**
    *   `Introduces the player to the everyday struggles of Lickskillet inhabitants  versus the Meat Oligarchy.`
    *   `Provides tangible examples of the 1970s tech aesthetic cl ashing with underlying advanced biotech.`
    *   `Allows meaningful interaction with a Swamp Witch, showcasing their role and knowledge .`
    *   `Offers choice and consequence in a localized conflict, building player agency.`
    *   ` Reinforces the Alethic modality of the 1970s tech aesthetic by showing attempts to subvert it  (the sabotage device).`
    *   `Demonstrates the Deontic modality of Automaton user stigma if  that path is explored for information.`
*   **Relationship to Alethic Modality:** `The quest directly engages  with the 'Technological Aesthetic Constraint' by introducing a device that violates it. The capabilities of GE Alligators are central to the problem . Mambo Shula's potential magical interventions test the boundaries of 'Spectral Interaction' or similar esoteric knowledge.`
*    **Relationship to Deontic Modality:** `The actions of GatorCorp and the potential involvement of an Automaton/LLM  user (if that path is taken for how the devices were planted) brush against the 'Automaton/LLM User St igma.' The power of the Meat Oligarchy to act with relative impunity reflects their de facto permission to bend rules.`
*   ** Relationship to Axiological Modality:** `The quest highlights the value of alligator meat to the local economy, the ingenuity required  to survive (Mama Agnes, potentially the player), and the negative value placed on corporate overreach by Lickskillet locals . It also subtly reinforces the ingrained 1970s aesthetic by making deviations noticeable and suspicious.`
*    **Relationship to Epistemic Modality:** `The player must discern truth from misdirection (is it magic, malfunction , or sabotage?). Mambo Shula holds specific 'Swamp Witch Lore.' GatorCorp operates with a degree of hidden knowledge/ intent. The 'invisible women' conspiracy might be invoked by paranoid locals as an initial explanation for the gator problems before  the truth is found.`
*   **Key Functional Tensions/Trade-offs:**
    *   `Helping  Mama Agnes vs. avoiding direct conflict with the powerful GatorCorp.`
    *   `Trusting the "weird" Swamp  Witch vs. relying on purely "logical" (but perhaps flawed) technological explanations.`
    *   `Choosing a "clean " solution that lets GatorCorp off easy vs. a "messy" one that might bring justice but also repercussions.`
    *    `Upholding the 1970s tech aesthetic in solutions vs. the temptation of using/understanding the more advanced  (but illicit) sabotage tech.`
