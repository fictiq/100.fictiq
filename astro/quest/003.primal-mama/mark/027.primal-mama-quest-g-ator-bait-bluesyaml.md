## I. Quest Overview

*    **Logline:** A desperate Lickskillet gator processor, Mama June, is losing her livelihood as her  prime alligator catches are being mysteriously "spooked" or stolen right from her traps before she can harvest them. She suspects  foul play from the encroaching Consolidated Croc Corp (CCC) and needs an outsider to investigate without drawing CCC's direct ire .
*   **Location(s):** Lickskillet (Mama June's Processing Shack), surrounding Bayou  trap lines, potential hidden CCC outpost/facility.
*   **Suggested Player Level:** 5-8 (assuming  a leveling system)
*   **Primary Objective(s):**
    1.  Investigate the disturbances at  Mama June's trap lines.
    2.  Identify the cause of the missing/spooked gators .
    3.  Neutralize the threat to Mama June's operation.
*   **Potential Rewards:**
    *    Crowns (currency)
    *   XP
    *   Reputation increase in Lickskillet
     *   Unique 1970s-aesthetic schematic (e.g., "Gator Sonar Lure Mk . II" or "Camouflaged Trap Emitter")
    *   A prized cut of "Mama June's Best " alligator jerky.
*   **Key Primal Mama Elements Utilized:**
    *   Alligator-based economy and diet .
    *   Bayou environment.
    *   1970s tech aesthetic (even for nefarious  devices).
    *   Meat oligarchy (Consolidated Croc Corp) vs. mom-and-pop operations .
    *   Potential for Automaton/LLM involvement (as a red herring or minor tool).
     *   Solar power reliance (for GE gators and tech).

## II. Quest Walkthrough

** A. The Hook: Mama June's Plea**

1.  **Starting Point:** The player arrives in Licksk illet. They might overhear worried whispers among locals about tough times for independent processors, or Mama June herself (a stout, no-nonsense  woman in her late 50s with a voice like gravel and a heart of gold) might approach the player if  they have a reputation for "fixin' things" or look capable.
2.  **The Problem:** Mama June  explains that her gator traps, usually reliable, have been coming up empty or showing signs of gators being violently scared  off. Her best solar-charged GE gators, which she relies on, are either vanishing or returning skittish and  non-productive. She suspects Consolidated Croc Corp (CCC), who have been trying to buy her out for months.
    *    *Dialogue Snippet (Mama June):* "Them CCC vultures been circlin', tryin' to peck  away at what little us small folk got left. Now my gators are actin' like Burt Reynolds himself done told ' em a ghost story! Somethin' ain't right, and it smells fishier than a week-old catfish  in July."

**B. Investigation: Bayou Blues**

1.  **Examine Trap Lines:** The player  follows Mama June (or directions) to her trap lines in the bayou.
    *   **Clue 1 ( Alethic: Possibility):** At the first few empty traps, player uses their "Swamp Savvy" (W itcher Senses equivalent). They find unusually large, panicked thrash marks, but no alligator remains. Some traps are  damaged in a way inconsistent with normal alligator behavior.
    *   **Clue 2 (Alethic: Poss ibility/Epistemic: Knowledge):** Further along, they find a trap with a strange, faint, rhythmic hum.  Using a basic 1970s-style "Frequency Detector" (chunky buttons, analog needle display), they isolate  a peculiar sonic frequency.
    *   **Clue 3 (Alethic: Impossibility/Poss ibility):** Near another trap, they find a patch of swamp grass that’s been oddly flattened, not by an  alligator, but by something with a regular, mechanical pattern. Perhaps faint oil traces that don't match local flora/fauna. 
    *   *(Optional Complication/Red Herring – Deontic/Epistemic):* Player might find a discarded , damaged datachip near a trap. If they try to get it read in Lickskillet, the local  tech (who uses an Automaton for diagnostics) might be ostracized, or the chip might contain harmless agricultural data, leading  the player to suspect Automaton sabotage, a common fear/prejudice.*

**C. Tracing the Source: The Hum  in the Swamp**

1.  **Follow the Frequency:** Using the Frequency Detector, the player tracks the sonic emissions  deeper into a less-traveled part of the bayou.
2.  **Obstacles:**
    *   Natural  swamp hazards (e.g., territorial non-GE gators, vampire bunnies – if only as environmental color, or a minor  threat if disturbed).
    *   Perhaps a few low-level CCC "security" drones (stylized with 197 0s aesthetics – boxy, maybe with wood paneling, but functionally still drones) that patrol the perimeter of the source.  These would be designed to scare, not necessarily kill, to maintain plausible deniability.
3.  **Discovery :** The player discovers a hidden, camouflaged CCC sub-station. It's solar-powered (large,  clunky solar panels artfully blended with the swamp) and features a prominent, chunky antenna array emitting the disruptive sonic frequency . The station itself adheres to the 1970s tech aesthetic (control panels with large toggle switches, CRT -style monitors displaying simple wave patterns).

**D. Confrontation: Disrupting the Disruption**

1.  **In filtration/Assault:** The player must find a way into the sub-station.
    *   **Stealth:** Sne ak past patrols and disable external security measures (e.g., re-wiring a chunky junction box).
    *    **Combat:** Engage CCC Enforcers (Humans with standard firearms of the era).
2.  **The Device :** Inside, they find the "Sonic Scarecrow Mk. III" – a large, console-like machine with multiple oscillators  and a complex (but analog-looking) control panel. It’s clearly designed to emit frequencies that terrify all igators. Schematics on a nearby table (hand-drawn with 1970s drafting style) confirm its purpose .
3.  **The Choice:**
    *   **Destroy the Device:** The most direct approach. Plant  an explosive or sabotage its core components (pulling out vacuum tubes, smashing control panels). This will likely cause a significant  commotion and alert CCC more directly.
    *   **Reprogram/Disable the Device:** A more subtle approach. If  the player has technical skills (or finds a manual), they might be able to alter the frequency to something harmless, or simply  shut it down without major destruction. This might leave CCC unaware of who interfered for a while.
    *   ** Gather Evidence:** Take the schematics and perhaps a key component of the device to expose CCC to local authorities or a rival corporation  (if one exists/player knows of one). This is riskier but could have wider implications.

**E.  Resolution: Lickskillet Harmony?**

1.  **Return to Mama June:** The player reports their findings and  actions.
2.  **Consequences based on player's choice at the sub-station:**
    *   ** Device Destroyed:** Mama June is overjoyed. Lickskillet celebrates. CCC will likely investigate and may send more aggressive agents  later (leading to potential follow-up quests).
    *   **Device Disabled/Reprogrammed:** Mama June is  relieved. Things return to normal, but the threat of CCC reactivating or deploying a new device looms. CCC is less  likely to trace it back to the player immediately.
    *   **Evidence Gathered:** Mama June is cautious but  hopeful. This path could lead to a larger narrative arc involving legal battles, corporate espionage, or even rallying other small processors  against CCC. The immediate problem might not be fully solved.
3.  **Rewards Distributed:** Mama June pays the player.  Reputation in Lickskillet changes. Player receives any unique schematics or items promised.

## III. Pr imal Mama Codex Integration & Coherence Checks

*   **Alethic Modality:**
    *   The existence  of GE solar-powered gators is central.
    *   The 1970s tech aesthetic is  strictly applied to the CCC Sonic Scarecrow and player's Frequency Detector.
    *   Solar power is the source for  the CCC sub-station.
    *   Vampire bunnies might make a cameo as environmental hazards, their authenticated  existence upheld.
*   **Deontic Modality:**
    *   CCC's actions are illegal/ unethical (sabotage).
    *   The player operates outside formal law enforcement, as is common in such settings.
     *   The (optional) Automaton/LLM user stigma is touched upon as a potential social dynamic.
*    **Axiological Modality:**
    *   The quest highlights the value of self-reliance (Mama June)  vs. corporate greed (CCC).
    *   Alligator meat is shown as a vital resource.
    *    The 1970s aesthetic is the accepted norm for technology.
*   **Epistemic Modality:** 
    *   The player uncovers hidden knowledge (CCC's plot).
    *   The nature of the Sonic  Scarecrow technology (advanced function, retro shell) is a piece of world-specific knowledge.
    *   Mis information (blaming Automaton users) could be a minor theme.
*   **Historical & Temporal Coherence:** 
    *   The conflict between established mom-and-pop businesses and newer, aggressive corporations like CCC is a logical outgrowth  of a post-calamity society rebuilding its economy.
*   **Synchronic Coherence:**
    *    The bayou environment, the 1970s tech, and the alligator-centric economy coexist. The  Sonic Scarecrow, while perhaps using advanced acoustic principles, *looks* like it was built in 1978 .
    *   The actions of CCC are plausible given their desire to dominate the market.

 ## V. Designer Notes & Potential Expansions

*   The "Sonic Scarecrow" could be a piece of repurposed  pre-Calamity tech, retrofitted by CCC with a 1970s interface. This could tie  into deeper lore about what technology survived or was rediscovered.
*   If the player chooses to gather evidence, a follow -up quest could involve navigating Lickskillet's (or even Beetriot's) corrupt local bureaucracy or  trying to find a media outlet (perhaps a pirate radio station broadcasting Burt Reynolds sermons?) willing to expose CCC.
*    The optional Automaton/LLM red herring could be expanded if desired, perhaps with a side-character in Lickskillet  who *is* being unfairly targeted due to their use of such tools, and the player can choose to help them clear  their name separately.
*   The specific design of the Frequency Detector should be pure 1970s:  a handheld box with an antenna, a dial for tuning, and a needle gauge that jumps when near the target frequency,  perhaps with an earphone for audio feedback (crackles and a distinct tone).
*   The "Vampire Bunn ies" could be an alternative cause investigated by the player, only to find out it's *also* CCC experimenting  with biological disruption methods, or a Swamp Witch whose territory was encroached upon by Mama June or CCC. This adds another layer of  weirdness. For this quest, I've kept them as minor environmental color, but they *could* be the primary method  of sabotage.
