## I. Quest Overview

*   **Quest Giver:** Jeb ediah "Jeb" Cottle, a nervous, independent alligator trapper/processor from a small, unnamed hamlet  near Lickskillet.
*   **Location(s):** Jeb's Hamlet, a specific stretch of the Saur ian Sanctuary's periphery, a hidden alcove within the deeper swamp, potentially a brief interaction point in Licksk illet.
*   **Premise:** Jeb's usually reliable GE Alligator traps, which rely on solar-charged  lures and 1970s-aesthetic sonic emitters, have been failing. Worse, the few alligators he * has* managed to catch recently have exhibited strange, sluggish behavior and their normally vibrant solar-absorption patterns are dull and ting ed with an unnatural crimson hue. He suspects foul play from a GatorCorp subsidiary trying to muscle him out, or perhaps a new  swamp sickness.
*   **Core Conflict:** Investigation of an anomaly, potential confrontation with natural or unnatural forces, uncovering a localized  ecological imbalance or a new form of interference.
*   **Potential Themes:** Man vs. Nature (altered), consequences  of GE, corporate overreach vs. individual survival, the pervasiveness of the world's "miasma."

## II. Quest Structure & Objectives

**Phase 1: The Complaint**
1.  **Objective :** Speak to Jebediah Cottle in his hamlet.
    *   **Details:** Jeb is agitated. His  livelihood is threatened. He'll show the player a malfunctioning lure (chunky, wood-paneled, with a dim , flickering LED display) and perhaps a data-cassette (1970s style) with erratic energy readings from a recent  "sick" gator.
    *   **Player Actions:** Listen, ask questions about the symptoms, GatorCorp' s recent activities, any unusual swamp phenomena.
    *   **World Coherence Links:**
        *   Alethic : `Solar Dominance`, `Technological Aesthetic Constraint`, `Alligator Biogenesis`.
        *   Deontic:  `Automaton/LLM User Stigma` (Jeb might mention he can't afford or trust an Autom aton diagnostician), friction from meat processor oligarchies.
        *   Axiological: Value of alligator meat for  survival.

**Phase 2: On the Trail**
1.  **Objective:** Investigate Jeb's trap line  near the Saurian Sanctuary.
    *   **Details:** Player travels to the designated area. Traps are indeed  inert or malfunctioning.
    *   **Player Actions:**
        *   Use Witcher Senses-equivalent (e .g., "Swamp Sense" or "Primal Attunement") to examine traps, lures, and the  immediate environment.
        *   Find crimson-stained cattails or algae near affected traps.
        *   Discover faint , unusual energy signatures or biological residue on lures that doesn't match typical alligator spoor.
    *   **World  Coherence Links:**
        *   Alethic: `Alligator Biogenesis` (understanding normal gator function vs . this anomaly), `Solar Dominance` (lures should be working).
        *   Epistemic: Player  gathers knowledge about the anomaly.

2.  **Objective (Optional):** Analyze a residue sample.
    *    **Details:** If player collects a sample, they might take it to a contact in Lickskillet (e. g., a back-alley bio-tinkerer who works within the 70s tech constraints but understands GE  basics).
    *   **Player Actions:**
        *   Interact with the bio-tinkerer. The analysis  (done on chunky, analog equipment) might be inconclusive or point towards an unknown biological agent, possibly with strange energy- leeching properties.
        *   The tinkerer might have a "stain on their reputation" if they use a  hidden, jury-rigged LLM for cross-referencing, adding a small social risk/dialogue element.
     *   **World Coherence Links:**
        *   Alethic: `Technological Aesthetic Constraint`.
        *    Deontic: `Automaton/LLM User Stigma`.
        *   Epistemic: Access to specialized knowledge. 

**Phase 3: The Crimson Source**
1.  **Objective:** Follow the trail of crimson cattails/ energy signatures deeper into the swamp.
    *   **Details:** The trail leads away from the main sanctuary waterways into a less- traveled, gloomier part of the bayou.
    *   **Player Actions:** Navigate the swamp, potentially encounter  mutated swamp flora/fauna (minor threats, e.g., overly aggressive gar, glowing fungi that pulse erratically). The  1970s aesthetic could mean the player's navigation tools are somewhat rudimentary (e.g., compass  and paper map with hand-drawn additions, a chunky depth-sounder).
    *   **World Coherence Links :**
        *   Alethic: The "strangely spiritual miasma" influencing the environment.

2.  ** Objective:** Discover the source of the crimson anomaly.
    *   **Details:** The trail leads to a hidden alc ove or a small, isolated island where a cluster of "Vampire Bunnies" have established a warren. These  bunnies aren't drinking blood, but their fur (or some excreted substance) has taken on a crimson hue after they 've gnawed on specific, bio-luminescent roots that have become hyper-energized by runoff from a faulty , buried solar power conduit (1970s era, of course, and leaking). The bunnies are now inadvertently  leeching energy from nearby solar-powered devices (like Jeb's lures) and affecting the alligators that consume plants  growing near their warren.
    *   **Player Actions:** Observe the bunnies. Examine the glowing roots. Discover  the damaged conduit (perhaps with a rusted, wood-paneled access hatch).
    *   **World Coherence Links:**
         *   Alethic: `Vampire Bunny Propagation` (their existence is fact), `Solar Dominance` (mal functioning solar tech as a plot point), `Technological Aesthetic Constraint` (the faulty conduit).

**Phase 4:  Resolution**
1.  **Objective:** Deal with the Vampire Bunny infestation and the faulty conduit.
    *   ** Player Choices & Consequences:**
        *   **A) Exterminate the Bunnies:** Player can try to clear the war ren. This is messy and might anger a local Swamp Witch if these are *her* bunnies (see "Potential Com plications"). Alligators and lures recover quickly. Jeb is happy.
        *   **B) Repair/Seal the Conduit:**  Requires finding a way to patch the 1970s-tech conduit (perhaps needing specific parts, or a jury -rig that fits the aesthetic). This stops the hyper-energizing of the roots. Bunnies return to normal. All igators/lures recover slowly as the crimson effect dissipates. Jeb is eventually happy. This might require interacting with a grumpy , old-school solar technician.
        *   **C) Consult a Swamp Witch:** If the player suspects a deeper  supernatural element or discovers signs of witchery (e.g., small fetishes near the warren), they might seek out a local  Swamp Witch. She might explain the bunnies' new behavior is due to the "energized roots" and offer a ritual istic solution to cleanse the area or relocate the bunnies (perhaps for a price, or a favor). This is the most " Primal Mama" solution.
    *   **World Coherence Links:**
        *   All Modalities come  into play depending on the choice. `Spectral Interaction` might be relevant if a witch uses ghosts to help. `Sw amp Witch Lore` is key for option C.

**Phase 5: Reporting Back**
1.  **Objective :** Inform Jebediah Cottle of the outcome.
    *   **Details:** Jeb's reaction and reward will  vary based on the player's solution and its speed/effectiveness.
    *   **Player Actions:** Dialogue, receive  reward.
    *   **World Coherence Links:** The resolution reinforces the world's internal logic.

## IV. Potential Complications & Branches

*   **GatorCorp Interference:** While not the direct cause,  a GatorCorp agent might be snooping around, trying to buy out Jeb on the cheap due to his "bad luck,"  or even trying to steal his trap locations once they seem abandoned. Player might confront them.
*   **Swamp  Witch's Wrath/Aid:** If the bunnies belong to a specific Swamp Witch, killing them might incur her wrath. Conversely , approaching her respectfully might lead to her offering a unique solution (e.g., a ritual to calm the bunnies or shield  the traps, in exchange for a rare alchemical ingredient only found in a ghost-haunted part of the swamp). 
*   **Erpenthrope Witness:** An Erpenthrope, in their pursuit of "truth," might have  observed the strange bunny behavior and could offer cryptic clues if the player encounters them.
*   **Technological Challenge:** Repair ing the conduit might involve a mini-puzzle conforming to the 1970s tech aesthetic – e.g.,  rerouting power using specific chunky switches in a sequence, or finding a vacuum tube replacement for a control unit.

 ## V. Rewards

*   **Standard:** Crowns, crafting materials (alligator parts, common swamp resources).
*    **Choice-Dependent:**
    *   Exterminating bunnies + quick fix for Jeb: Higher cash reward from Jeb.
     *   Repairing conduit: Moderate cash reward, perhaps a unique 1970s-style gadget schematic from an  old solar technician.
    *   Swamp Witch solution: Lower cash reward from Jeb, but a unique charm/ talisman from the Witch, or access to new ritual knowledge/recipes. Maybe a "Vampire Bunny Rep ellent" recipe that uses Burt Reynolds' Old Spice aftershave (a nod to deified celebs).
*    **Reputation:** Minor positive reputation with independent trappers; minor negative with GatorCorp if their agent is thwarted. Significant  positive or negative reputation with the local Swamp Witch.

## VI. World Coherence & Internal Logic Notes

*    This quest directly engages with the `Alethic` modalities of GE Alligator solar dependence, Vampire Bunny existence, the 1 970s tech constraint, and the permeating "miasma" of the swamp.
*   It explores  the `Deontic` modality of the meat oligarchy's pressure on small operators.
*   The player 's choices reflect different `Axiological` approaches – pragmatic destruction, technical problem-solving, or embracing the supernatural /spiritual side of the world.
*   `Epistemic` modality is central, as the player uncovers the true , unexpected cause of the problem, moving beyond Jeb's initial (and plausible) conspiracy theory.
*   The quest  aims to feel like a natural occurrence within Primal Mama, where advanced biotech, retro aesthetics, and strange swamp phenomena collide . The "death by burger" rule isn't directly invoked, but the reliance on alligator meat underscores its importance.
*    The potential involvement of an Automaton/LLM-using tinkerer reinforces that specific social stigma.
*   The  solution involving a Swamp Witch and her unique lore provides a distinctly "Primal Mama" flavor.
