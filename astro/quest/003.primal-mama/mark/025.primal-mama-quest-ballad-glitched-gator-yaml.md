---

## I. Quest Overview

*   **Quest Giver:** Jedediah "Jed"  Beaux, a grizzled, independent alligator rancher in the Lickskillet outskirts.
*   **Location:** Jed 's Alligator Ranch (a series of interconnected, murky bayou pens), Lickskillet's local " Tech & Tinker" shack, and potentially a discreet BayouCorp processing outpost.
*   **Premise:** One of Jed's  prize genetically engineered (GE) alligators, "Burt" (named in reverence), has started malfunctioning. Its solar absorption  is erratic, its regeneration is sluggish, and its usually placid (for a 24-foot gator) demeanor  has become unpredictable. Jed suspects sabotage, possibly from the encroaching meat oligarchy (BayouCorp), or a curse from  Old Maude, the local Swamp Witch he recently underpaid for some "protective" charms.
*   **Player Goal :** Investigate the cause of Burt's malfunction, determine if it's sabotage, supernatural, or simple technological failure within  the world's constraints, and find a solution.
*   **Core Themes:** Tradition vs. Progress (O ligarchy vs. Mom-and-Pop), Technological Reliance & Vulnerability (within 1970s aesthetic ), Distrust of Authority/Corporations, Bayou Superstition.

## II. Quest Steps & Co herence Integration

**Step 1: Jed's Plea**

*   **Description:** The player finds Jed Beaux  agitated near one of his larger pens. Burt the alligator is listless one moment, thrashing erratically the next. Jed  explains the situation, offering a handsome sum of Alligator Scrip and prime gator steaks (the local currency and valued  commodity). He mentions his suspicions about BayouCorp's recent "friendly inquiries" about his ranch and his spat with Old Maude .
*   **Coherence Check (Modalities):**
    *   **Alethic:** Establishes the existence  and general capabilities of GE Alligators (`Alligator Biogenesis`). Hints at potential for malfunction.
    *   **Deontic :** Highlights the economic pressure from `Meat Processor Oligarchies` and the local norms of dealing with `Swamp Witches`. 
    *   **Axiological:** Alligator meat as valuable (`Primary, acceptable... protein`), reverence for de ified celebrities (`Burt Reynolds`).
    *   **Epistemic:** Jed's knowledge is limited to ranch ing; he resorts to common beliefs (sabotage, curses).

**Step 2: Initial Investigation - Observing Burt** 

*   **Description:** The player observes Burt.
    *   **Witcher Senses (or equivalent Pr imal Mama sensory skill):** Might reveal unusual energy fluctuations around Burt's solar chromatophores, or a faint, artificial  scent. The gator's internal bio-battery readouts (on a chunky, 70s-style  panel attached to the pen's control station) show erratic charging.
    *   **Direct Observation:** Burt's movements  are jerky, his regenerative attempts on a minor scratch are slow.
*   **Coherence Check (Modalities &  Entity Function):**
    *   **Alethic:** `Alligator Biogenesis` (solar absorption, regeneration) is  shown to be failing. `Technological Aesthetic Constraint` is visible in the control panel.
    *   **Entity  Function (Burt the GE Alligator - Modified):**
        *   *Current State:* Malfunctioning solar absorption , impaired regeneration, erratic behavior.
        *   *Authenticated Baseline (pre-malfunction):* Efficient solar energy absorption,  rapid tail regeneration, predictable (trained) behavior.

**Step 3: Following Leads**

*   **A. The Swamp  Witch (Optional):**
    *   **Description:** Player visits Old Maude. She's initially hostile due  to Jed's underpayment. Player can bribe her, intimidate her (if capable), or do a small favor (e. g., retrieve a particularly plump vampire bunny). Maude, using her esoteric methods (perhaps examining a scale from Burt or  reading gator-bone omens), declares it's "no natural swamp curse" but "bad machine-juju." She  might offer a (temporarily useful but ultimately ineffective) "cleansing" charm with a 1970s- style amulet.
    *   **Coherence Check:**
        *   **Alethic:** `Vampire Bunny  Propagation`, `Spectral Interaction` (implied in her methods).
        *   **Epistemic:** `Swamp Witch  Lore` (her ability to diagnose, even if not fix, the issue).
        *   **Axiological:** The  transactional nature of dealing with a Swamp Witch.

*   **B. The Local Tech (Lickskillet Tech  & Tinker):**
    *   **Description:** Player takes a data-crystal (a chunky 8-track- looking thing) from Burt's pen control panel to "Sparky" Pete, Lickskillet's tech. Pete  works in a shack filled with 1970s tools and salvaged parts. He grumbles about the difficulty of maintaining advanced  biotech with "stone-age interfaces." He might initially be wary of helping if BayouCorp has been leaning on locals.
         *   *Analysis:* Pete hooks the data-crystal to a clunky diagnostic machine (oscilloscope, analog dials, wood  paneling). He discovers anomalous code fragments or energy signatures, suggesting external interference rather than simple component failure. He might mention  that the interference pattern is "too clean" for typical swamp interference, almost like it's targeted. He might not have the  components to fully shield against it but could identify the *type* of interference.
    *   **Coherence Check :**
        *   **Alethic:** `Technological Aesthetic Constraint` (Pete's tools, the data -crystal). `Solar Dominance` (implies advanced understanding, even if interfaces are retro).
        *   **De ontic:** `Automaton/LLM User Stigma` (Pete prides himself on "hands-on" work , eschewing more advanced AI diagnostics even if they theoretically exist).
        *   **Epistemic:** Pete's ` Technical Knowledge` is specialized in maintaining/repairing tech within the aesthetic constraints.

**Step 4: Uncovering Sab otage**

*   **Description:** Based on Pete's findings (or Maude's "machine-juju"  hint), the player searches Burt's pen and the surrounding ranch more thoroughly.
    *   **Discovery:** Using Witcher  Senses/sensory skill, the player finds a small, discreetly placed device camouflaged near the pen. It  has a crude BayouCorp logo scratched into its casing (or a serial number Pete can later trace to a BayouCorp batch  order). The device itself is a "Bio-Disruptor" â€“ a piece of 1970s- styled tech (chunky, maybe a directional antenna, powered by a small, overcharged solar cell) emitting a focused  energy pulse that interferes with the GE Alligators' specific solar absorption frequencies and regenerative nanites.
*   **Coherence  Check:**
    *   **Alethic:** `Technological Aesthetic Constraint` (design of the disruptor). Bayou Corp's capacity for such tech is implied by their oligarchy status.
    *   **Entity Function (Bay ouCorp Bio-Disruptor):**
        *   *Core Function:* To subtly impair the functionality of competitor  GE Alligators.
        *   *Capabilities:* Emits targeted energy pulses.
        *   *Limitations:* Requires  line-of-sight or close proximity; vulnerable to physical damage or specific counter-frequencies (if the player can develop one ). Its 1970s design might make it prone to overheating or its power source easily identifiable.

**Step  5: Resolution Paths**

*   **A. Simple Fix:**
    *   **Description:** The player destroys  or disables the Bio-Disruptor. Burt's condition gradually improves. Jed is overjoyed and pays the reward.
     *   **Consequences:** BayouCorp's involvement remains suspected but unproven. They might try again later.

 *   **B. Confrontation & Exposure (Harder):**
    *   **Description:** The player traces  the device (via Pete's help or by finding more clues) to a nearby, hidden BayouCorp monitoring station or a delivery  agent in Lickskillet.
        *   Player can confront the agent, leading to a fight or intimidation. The  agent might confess or try to bribe the player.
        *   Player could attempt to gather more evidence to expose BayouCorp to  the (ineffectual) local Lickskillet council or (more riskily) a rival corporation or an Er penthrope truth-seeker.
    *   **Coherence Check (Deontic):** This path tests the ` Meat Processor Oligarchies'` power and the local community's ability/willingness to act against them. `Gun  Ownership (Regional)` might come into play if a firefight ensues.
    *   **Consequences:** Higher reward  from Jed, potential reputation gain/loss with factions, BayouCorp becomes a more direct antagonist.

*   **C. Supernatural  Misdirection (Player Error/Alternative):**
    *   **Description:** If the player focused solely on Old Maude and didn 't investigate technologically, they might use her "cleansing" charm. Burt might show temporary, slight improvement (place bo, or the charm coincidentally masks a symptom for a bit), but the problem will recur, leading Jed to be disappointed .
    *   **Consequences:** Lower reward, quest feels incomplete, underlying issue persists.

## IV. Rewards

*   **Base:** Alligator Scrip, selection  of prime gator steaks.
*   **Bonus (Sabotage Confirmed):** Extra Scrip, a unique  1970s-style ranching tool (e.g., a "Gator Soother" sonic device  with limited charges, calming minor agitation), increased reputation in Lickskillet.
*   **Bonus (BayouCorp Agent  Dealt With):** Significant Scrip increase, potential lead for a follow-up quest against BayouCorp, faction standing  changes.
*   **Failure (Misdiagnosed as Curse, problem recurs):** Minimal Scrip, Jed's disappointment. 

---

## V. Coherence Notes & World Integration

*   This quest directly engages with the core economic conflict of  Primal Mama: the tension between mom-and-pop operations and the `Meat Processor Oligarchies`.
*    It leverages the `Technological Aesthetic Constraint` by having the sabotage device and diagnostic tools adhere to the 1970s  style, creating unique challenges for detection and analysis.
*   The GE `Alligator Biogenesis` rules are central,  as their specific functions (solar power, regeneration) are the target of the sabotage.
*   The `Epistemic ` modality is explored through Jed's limited understanding, Maude's supernatural (but ultimately misdirected) insights, and Pete 's specialized technical knowledge. The player uncovers the "truth" of the situation.
*   `Axiological`  values like self-reliance (Jed) and the value of alligator meat are reinforced.
*   The quest provides opportunities to interact  with diverse facets of Lickskillet society (ranchers, witches, techs).
*   The "death  by burger" rule is not directly invoked but the world's reliance on alligator meat as the primary protein source underscores the  importance of Jed's ranch.
*   The `Automaton/LLM User Stigma` is subtly reinforced by  Pete's hands-on, analog approach to diagnostics, contrasting with a potentially more efficient (but culturally undesirable) AI- driven analysis.

This quest aims to feel grounded in Primal Mama's unique blend of retro-futurism, bay ou culture, and underlying societal tensions, using the established modalities and entity functions as its foundation.
