Okay,  this is a fantastic challenge! I'll take the structure and concept of Witcher 3's Decoctions and re- imagine them entirely within the Primal Mama world, using its established lore and aesthetic from the "Coherence & Internal Logic Protocol" you  provided.

The core idea: long-lasting, high-toxicity (or "Miasmic Strain") concoctions made  from the unique flora and fauna of Primal Mama's bayou, granting passive effects. These will be "Bayou Brews " or "Swamp Tonics."

Here's the re-contextualized list:

## Introduction:  Harnessing the Bayou's Essence

*Bayou Brews (often called "Swamp Tonics" by old -timers or "Bio-Synergists" in Beetriot's fringe labs) are potent concoctions imbibed for  sustained, passive biological effects. Unlike the quick-acting "Gator Gulp" stims or ritualistic "Spirit  Fumes," Brews integrate with the user's physiology over a considerable duration â€“ sometimes lasting well over an hour,  especially if the imbiber has undergone Miasma Acclimatization treatments.*

*The trade-off for this  longevity is significant **Miasmic Strain**. Each Brew floods the system with complex bio-compounds and latent energies, taxing the  body's ability to maintain equilibrium. Their effects, while persistent, are often more nuanced or specialized than immediate combat stims.  Mastering the use of Bayou Brews requires a robust constitution or specific biological/technological enhancements to increase one's M iasmic Strain threshold. With careful preparation and tolerance, an individual can benefit from a long-lasting augmentation, perfectly suited for  extended expeditions into the deeper swamp or navigating the subtle dangers of Primal Mama's altered ecosystem.*

*These recipes  are often hoarded by Swamp Witches, seasoned Erpenthropes, or rogue bio-engineers operating outside  Beetriot's stringent (if aesthetically limited) R&D protocols.*

**Notes on Ingredients:**

*   **Cypress Still Spirit:** The common, potent, and often  illicitly distilled alcohol base. Probably has a 1970s-style cheap liquor label if bought, or comes  in a repurposed gas can if homemade.
*   **Mutagens/Glands/Specific Parts:** These are the core of  the Brew, carrying the essence of the creature or phenomenon. "Alpha Solar-Gator Gland," "Erpenthrope D ermal Sample," "Vampire Bunny Prime Fang," "Spectral Weeper Tear-Duct Crystal" all suggest unique  properties.
*   **Flora:** Ingredients like "Sun-Kissed Kudzu," "Spirit-Bloom Petals,"  "Deep Bayou Root," "Murkweed Leaf," "Ghost Orchid Petal," "Mirecap Fungus," "Phosphor -Moss," "Volt-Fruit," "Lumina-Berry," "Bayou Pepper," "Styx Root," and  "Sunpetal" evoke the unique, possibly mutated or bio-luminescent, plant life of Primal Mama's  swamps.
*   **Bio-Gels/Capacitor Gels/Bio-Oil:** These suggest some  level of processing or refinement, fitting the retro-futuristic biotech angle.
*   **Spectral Components:** "E ctoplasmic Residue," "Condensed Vapor," "Bone Dust" (from undead), "Tear-Duct Crystal ," "Resonance Membrane," "Purified Spectral Condensate" indicate interactions with the ghostly elements of Primal Mama .
*   **"Prime" or "Alpha" or "Elder" variants:** Suggest stronger, rarer versions of  base creatures, yielding more potent Brew components.

This list maintains the *function* of Witcher decoctions (long-lasting buffs from  creature parts) but re-skins them entirely for the Primal Mama universe, drawing on its specific entities, aesthetics, and the  overall "bayou-infused, retro-futuristic, and strangely spiritual miasma." The effects of these Brews would  then be defined elsewhere, but their creation is now grounded in Primal Mama's world.
