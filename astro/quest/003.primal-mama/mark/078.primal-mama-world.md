Okay, let's re forge those Witcher bombs in the crucible of Primal Mama's bayou-infused, retro-futuristic, strangely  spiritual miasma. We'll use the established rules and flavor from the Coherence Protocol as our guide.

The  core mechanic remains: craftable explosives using scavenged/local components, replenished via rest using a local potent potable (let 's call it "Swamp Hooch"), with improved versions requiring rarer ingredients and the base item.

## Introduction: Bayou Ingen uity & Makeshift Mayhem

*In the murky depths and rusting settlements of Primal Mama's world, necessity  breeds invention. These aren't the clean, mass-produced explosives of a forgotten age, nor the elegant sorceries  of high fantasy. These are **Bayou Bombs** â€“ volatile concoctions brewed from swamp flora, processed alligator parts, salvaged  70s-era electronics components, and perhaps a touch of the Cthulhu-goth witchery that  permeates the wetlands.*

*Bombs provide tactical advantages, dealing damage, disrupting foes, or altering the environment. They  are crafted from scavenged components and recipes found or learned throughout the swamps and settlements. A limited supply can be carried, but  resting allows for replenishment, assuming you have a stash of potent **Swamp Hooch** (a ubiquitous, often hazardous , local moonshine) to serve as a primary solvent and catalyst.*

*Higher-grade bombs ("Improved," "Prime ") offer enhanced effects but require rarer materials and the knowledge (or possession) of the preceding version.*
