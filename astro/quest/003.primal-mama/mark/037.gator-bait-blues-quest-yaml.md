 
# Primal Mama Quest: Gator Bait Blues

**Quest Giver:** Mama Creole, a weathered gator farmer in L ickskillet.
**Location:** Lickskillet & surrounding Bayou Nonesuch.
**Suggested Level:** 5 -8
**Prerequisites:** Access to Lickskillet.

---

## Quest Log Entry:

* Mama Creole, a pillar of the Lickskillet gator farming community, is in a right tizzy. Her prize  solar-charged, tail-regeneratin' breeding gator, "Big Earl," has vanished from his pen. She  suspects the no-good Gator Grabbers gang, but somethin' about the scene smells fishier than week-old bait . She needs a sharp eye and a steady hand to track down Earl and deal with whoever's responsible.*

---

##  Walkthrough:

**1. Meeting Mama Creole**

*   **Objective:** Speak to Mama Creole in Lickskillet .

Head to the heart of Lickskillet, a ramshackle collection of stilt-houses and g ator pens smelling of swamp gas and fried gator tail. Mama Creole can usually be found near her main processing shed, a structure  adorned with faded Burt Reynolds posters and festooned with surprisingly sophisticated (though undeniably 1970s-styled ) solar battery monitors.

Approach Mama Creole. She's a woman whose face tells a thousand swamp tales, her voice  raspy but firm.

> **Mama Creole:** "Well, look what the cat-gator dragged in. You  ain't from around here, are ya, cher? Don't matter. Got troubles bigger'n a Beet riot ego. My Big Earl... gone! Vanished like a fart in a hurricane!"

Ask her about Big Earl  and the circumstances of his disappearance.

> **Mama Creole:** "Earl ain't just any gator. He's a  prime specimen! Twenty-four feet of sun-eatin', tail-growin' perfection. His pen... busted  open. Them low-down Gator Grabbers, I reckon. Always tryin' to undercut honest folk. But...  there's somethin' odd. Tracks too heavy, and a strange... *slickness* left behind. Ain' t natural."

She'll offer a reward of prime gator steaks (the lifeblood of Lickskillet's  economy) and some "pre-Calamity" tech-bits she's salvaged (1970s  aesthetic, of course) if you can find Earl and deal with the culprits.

*   **Note: Mama Creole ( Entity Functional Profile Snippet - EFPP Style):**
    *   **Entity Type:** Person (NPC)
     *   **Core Function:** Quest Giver, Local Expert.
    *   **Key Capabilities:**
        *    `FUNC-MCREOLE-01 (Gator Husbandry)`: Deep knowledge of GE alligator behavior,  needs, and pen security (within Lickskillet norms). Auth: CILP - Alethic (GE  Alligators), Axiological (Alligator Meat).
        *   `FUNC-MCREOLE-02 (Local  Intel)`: Aware of local gangs like the Gator Grabbers and general bayou happenings. Auth: CILP - Ep istemic (Folk Knowledge).
    *   **Limitations:**
        *   `INAB-MCREOLE-0 1 (Limited Combat Prowess)`: Relies on others for direct confrontation beyond basic self-defense.
        *   ` DEPEND-MCREOLE-01 (Community Reliance)`: Her operation is small-scale, vulnerable to larger forces . Auth: CILP - Deontic (friction from meat oligarchy).

*   **Reward:**
     *   200 XP
    *   50 Crowns (or equivalent in Gator Steaks)
    *   1 x  "Chunk-o-Matic" 1970s Tech Mod (e.g., a slightly more efficient solar charger  component with wood paneling).

**2. Investigating Big Earl's Pen**

*   **Objective:** Examine  Big Earl's pen for clues.

Mama Creole leads you to a large, reinforced pen. The gate is indeed  busted.

*   **Witcher Senses (or "Swamp Savvy" equivalent):**
    *    **Broken Gate:** Heavy, metallic. Bent outwards with considerable force. Seems almost *peeled* open.
    *    **Drag Marks:** Deep gouges in the mud, leading away from the pen. Much heavier than a gator usually makes,  even one Earl's size.
    *   **Oily Residue:** Patches of a strange, viscous,  black oil near the drag marks and on the broken gate. Smells faintly of burnt circuits and ozone, not swamp decay .
        *   *Geralt/Player Character:* "This oil... it's not natural. Smells  like old machinery, but... different."
    *   **Discarded Component:** Near the edge of the swamp, find  a small, strangely clean piece of 1970s-styled tech – perhaps a data-cassette casing  or a singed vacuum tube with an unfamiliar insignia.
        *   *Geralt/Player Character:* "This  looks like it came off something... manufactured. Too clean for swamp junk."

*   **Note: GE Alligator " Big Earl" (EFPP Snippet):**
    *   **Entity Type:** Creature (Objective)
    *    **Core Function:** Prize breeding stock, MacGuffin.
    *   **Key Capabilities (as per CILP  - Alethic):**
        *   `FUNC-GEGATOR-01 (Solar Sustenance)`: Can  absorb solar energy via specialized chromatophores.
        *   `FUNC-GEGATOR-02 (Regeneration)`: Efficient  tail regeneration.
        *   `PROP-GEGATOR-01 (Size/Weight)`: Approx. 24 .15 ft, 3500 lbs. (Explains heavy drag marks but also makes him hard to move conventionally ).
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**
        *   `VULN-GEGATOR-01 ( Capture)`: Can be subdued/transported with sufficient force/technology.
        *   `DEPEND-GEGATOR -01 (Sunlight/Maintenance)`: May require periods of direct sun for optimal function or specialized maintenance, potentially  influencing captor's motives. (Implicit from "solar energy absorption").

Mama Creole, upon seeing the oil and  tech-bit:
> **Mama Creole:** "Saints of the Smokey and the Bandit... that ain't  no Gator Grabber spoor. That's... that's *Beetriot* slick, or worse. What  in the bayou is goin' on?"

She suggests talking to **Ol' Man Cypress**, a reclusive tra pper who sees much from his perch deep in Bayou Nonesuch, or perhaps **Madame Mambo**, the local Swamp Witch, if  you're brave enough to seek her counsel.

**3. Seeking Information**

*   **Optional Objective:**  Talk to Ol' Man Cypress.
*   **Optional Objective:** Talk to Madame Mambo.

*   **Ol ' Man Cypress:**
    Found in a rickety shack further into the bayou. He’s initially suspicious. 
    > **Ol' Man Cypress:** "Seen a commotion last night. Lights, strange whirrin' sounds...  like a thousand angry june bugs in a tin can. Weren't no airboat. Too quiet for that, too fast . Headed towards the old Sunken Labs, I reckon."
    He can mark the "Sunken Labs" on your map . He might also mutter about "them invisible women and their metal devils again," referencing the common conspiracy.

*   ** Madame Mambo (Swamp Witch):**
    Her hut is in a particularly fetid, Cthulhu- goth-infused part of the swamp, surrounded by pens of chittering Vampire Bunnies.
    > **Madame  Mambo:** (Cackles) "Big Earl, eh? The spirits are restless. They whisper of *metal  bones and cold thought*, not flesh and blood thieves. They say the old world stirs in its watery grave. If you seek  him, follow the black blood of the machine... and perhaps leave an offering of fresh gator liver for my darlings."
     She might offer a minor charm for protection (e.g., "Vampire Bunny Repellent") or a vague  prophecy about facing "something that ain't alive but ain't dead neither."

*   **Note: Swamp  Witch (EFPP Snippet):**
    *   **Entity Type:** Person (NPC, Information Source)
    *    **Core Function:** Provides esoteric knowledge, potential minor magical aid.
    *   **Key Capabilities:**
        *    `FUNC-SWWITCH-01 (Ritual Magic/Divination)`: Can perceive/interact with spirits , gain cryptic insights. Auth: CILP - Alethic (Spectral Interaction), Epistemic (Swamp Witch Lore). 
        *   `FUNC-SWWITCH-02 (Vampire Bunny Propagation)`: Controls/creates  Vampire Bunnies. Auth: CILP - Alethic.
    *   **Costs/Dependencies:** May  require offerings, operates on inscrutable motives.

**4. Tracking the Abductors**

*   **Objective:** Follow  the trail to the Sunken Labs.

The drag marks and oily residue lead deeper into Bayou Nonesuch. You 'll likely need an airboat or pirogue. The trail is intermittent, forcing you to rely on your " Swamp Savvy" and the clues gathered.

*   **Encounters along the way:**
    *   **G ator Grabbers Camp:** You stumble upon the Gator Grabbers. They're battered and terrified.
        > **Gator Grab ber Boss:** "Man, we *tried* for Earl! Figured a payday. But... somethin' else got  to him first. Big, metal things... silent. Tore through our nets like paper. Took Earl, and nearly took us  too! Headed towards the Sunken Labs, last we saw."
        They can offer a bit more detail about the machines  – "clunky, like old '70s earth-movers but faster, stronger," and "wood panel ing, can you believe it?" This reinforces the aesthetic constraint. They won't fight unless provoked.
    *   **Environmental  Hazards:** Patches of Vampire Bunnies (minor annoyance, can drain small amounts of health if player isn't careful),  treacherous quicksand bogs.

**5. The Sunken Labs**

*   **Objective:** Find Big Earl in the Sun ken Labs.
*   **Objective:** Deal with the abductors.

The Sunken Labs are a pre-C alamity (or early post-Calamity) research facility, partially submerged and overgrown. The architecture is brutalist retro -futuristic, with a distinct late 1970s design language. Flickering analog lights, humming generators , and the occasional whir of tape drives create an eerie atmosphere.

*   **Note: Rogue Automatons (EFPP  Snippet):**
    *   **Entity Type:** Creature/Object (Antagonist)
    *   **Core Function :** Abductors of Big Earl, guardians of the Sunken Labs.
    *   **Key Capabilities:**
        *    `FUNC-AUTO-01 (Heavy Lifting/Combat)`: Equipped with powerful hydraulic limbs (for dragging Earl) and possibly  crude, integrated 1970s-style energy weapons (lasers with chunky power packs, sonic emitters with  large parabolic dishes). Auth: Implied by advanced tech existing alongside 1970s aesthetic (CILP -  Alethic/Aesthetic Constraint).
        *   `FUNC-AUTO-02 (Networked Coordination - Rud imentary)`: Operate in small groups with basic tactical awareness.
    *   **Inabilities/Limitations:**
         *   `INAB-AUTO-01 (Outdated AI)`: Programming is old, potentially leading to predictable patterns  or exploitable glitches.
        *   `VULN-AUTO-01 (Aesthetic Weak Points)`: Dam aging their 1970s-style casings (wood panels, chunky buttons) might expose more vulnerable advanced components .
        *   `VULN-AUTO-02 (Power Source Reliance)`: May be tethered to or  reliant on recharging stations within the Labs. Disabling a central generator (with big, satisfying analog switches) could deactivate them.
         *   `CONSTRAINT-AUTO-01 (Design Adherence)`: Their 1970s design limits  their agility and repairability, making them somewhat clunky. Auth: CILP - Alethic (Technological Aesthetic  Constraint).
    *   **Stigma Context:** Their existence and actions might fuel the "Automaton/LLM  User Stigma" if news gets out, or confirm the "Invisible Women" conspiracy for some. Auth: CILP  - Deontic, Epistemic.

Inside the labs, you'll encounter several Rogue Automatons. They are surprisingly  tough and their 1970s aesthetic makes them unsettlingly anachronistic. Fight or sneak your way through. 

*   **Clues within the Labs:**
    *   Data-tapes (playable on a chunky,  reel-to-reel style console) reveal the Automatons were part of an old bio-energy research project. They were  programmed to acquire and utilize large biological power sources. Big Earl, a solar-powered gator, is a perfect,  if unintended, target.
    *   The Automatons may have reactivated due to a recent power surge or external  signal (tying into the "Invisible Women" conspiracy, perhaps, or just a random swamp phenomenon).

You find  Big Earl in a central chamber, hooked up to strange machinery, his solar chromatophores pulsing weakly as energy is drained from him.

 **6. Resolution**

*   **Player Choice:**
    *   **Destroy the Automatons:** A direct fight . If you can find the main control room, you might be able to trigger a feedback loop or overload their systems using  a decidedly analog interface (big red button, pulling multiple levers in sequence).
    *   **Disable the Power Core :** Find the Labs' main generator (a massive, humming contraption with exposed vacuum tubes and blinking lights). Sabot aging it (perhaps by finding a specific override keycard or solving a simple 1970s-style logic  puzzle on a terminal) deactivates all Automatons.
    *   **Reprogram/Redirect (Difficult Check ):** If the player has high "Tech Savvy" (or a special item), they might find a terminal to alter  the Automatons' prime directive, making them release Earl and become inert or even helpful (e.g., "Guard  this specific location only"). This would require navigating a clunky, text-based 1970s interface.

 Once the Automatons are dealt with, unhook Big Earl. He's weak but alive.

**7. Return  to Mama Creole**

*   **Objective:** Report back to Mama Creole.

Escort Big Earl back to L ickskillet (he'll slowly follow if nudged, or perhaps you find a way to jury-rig a  solar boost for him from lab equipment).

Mama Creole is overjoyed/relieved.
> **Mama Creole:** "By  Burt's glorious mustache, you did it, cher! Earl! Oh, you poor thing. Metal devils, you say? K new them Gator Grabbers weren't smart enough for this. The world's gettin' stranger than a two -headed gator at a crawfish boil."

*   **Rewards:**
    *   Standard reward (XP, Crowns /Steaks, Tech Mod).
    *   If Earl is returned unharmed: Bonus reputation in Lickskillet . Mama Creole might share a unique gator recipe or a particularly potent local moonshine.
    *   If the player  learned about the Automatons' origins: This information could be valuable. An Erpenthrope might appear and offer a cryptic  thanks or a small, ancient artifact for uncovering a piece of "truth."
    *   The story of the "Retro -Bots of Bayou Nonesuch" becomes local legend, further cementing the strangeness of Primal Mama.

## Post-Quest Notes (Internal Logic Considerations):

*   **Alethic Consistency:** The GE gator's solar  power and the Automatons' 1970s tech with advanced capabilities are central. The Automatons' power  source and Big Earl's energy draining should be visually and narratively consistent with the world's tech rules.
 *   **Deontic/Axiological Impact:** The quest can reinforce the Automaton/LLM stigma. The mom -and-pop farmer vs. mysterious advanced tech can play into themes of autonomy vs. automation. Mama Creole's faith  in local deities/celebrities could be invoked.
*   **Epistemic Elements:** The truth about the Automat ons is hidden, requiring investigation. The Swamp Witch and Ol' Man Cypress offer fragmented, folk-level knowledge, contrasting with the potential  for more "technical" truth found in the labs. The "Invisible Women" conspiracy can be subtly hinted at as a  possible origin for the Automatons' reactivation.
*   **Aesthetic Coherence:** All technology encountered (Automatons, lab  equipment, Mama Creole's farm tech, player's potential tools) must adhere to the late 197 0s design aesthetic, creating a unique visual and functional challenge/flavor.
