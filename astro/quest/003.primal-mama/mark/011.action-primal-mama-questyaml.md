## Introduction: A Disappearing Act in the  Lickskillet Backwaters

*The humid air of Lickskillet hangs heavy, thick with the scent of fried  gator and the distant hum of solar converters. But for "Granny" Agnes Perdue, a normally resilient mom -and-pop alligator rancher, the air is thick with worry. Her prize genetically-engineered (GE) alligator, "B urt's Pride" – a magnificent 20-footer with custom chrome-plated solar panels (strictly 70s aesthetic , of course) – has gone missing from its reinforced pen. Without Burt's Pride, her small operation, already  feeling the squeeze from the GatorCorp oligarchy, might just go belly-up. She needs a savvy individual, someone  who knows the swamp and isn't afraid of its stranger denizens, to find her prized possession or, failing that,  what happened to him.*

## Quest Giver & Location

*   **Quest Giver:** "Granny" Agnes  Perdue
*   **Location:** Perdue Gator Ranch, a somewhat dilapidated but functional ranch on the outskirts of Lickskillet , bordering the deeper, less-charted swamp.
*   **Suggested Player Level (if applicable):** 5-8 

---

## Objectives (Walkthrough Style)

1.  **Talk to Granny Agnes:**
    *   Travel  to the Perdue Gator Ranch. Granny Agnes, a woman whose face is a roadmap of bayou life, will be fre tting near an empty, damaged alligator pen.
    *   Listen to her story: Burt's Pride, her biggest  and most reliable solar-gator, vanished overnight. The pen's analog lock system (chunky keypad, flickering  LED display) was bypassed, and a section of the reinforced fence is bent outwards.
    *   She suspects Gator Corp foul play ("Those slick-suited Beetriot vultures!"), but also mentions local legends of Swamp Witches being particularly active  lately. She'll offer a reward of Pre-Calamity Bottlecaps and a legendary family recipe for "Sw amp Surprise Stew."

2.  **Investigate Burt's Pride's Pen:**
    *   Use  your "Bayou Intuition" [Ability Button, e.g., L2/LT + R3] to examine the  scene.
        *   `Red Highlight (Quest Object):` Damaged Fence – Bent outwards, but scorch marks suggest  something beyond brute force.
        *   `Red Highlight (Quest Object):` Bypassed Lock Panel – The  wood-panelled casing is pried open, wires crudely hotwired. The 1970s- style interface shows an "ERR: OVERRIDE" message on its CRT-like display.
        *   `Yellow  Highlight (Clue):` Strange, almost iridescent slime near the damaged fence.
        *   `Yellow Highlight (Clue ):` Faint, unusual humming sound, almost like a miscalibrated synthesizer, detected by your augmetic ear implant ( if player has one, or just general keen hearing).
    *   Geralt-equivalent commentary: "Sl ime's not gator. Smells... unnatural. And that humming... not standard tech malfunction."

3.  **( Optional) Question Lickskillet Locals:**
    *   Head into Lickskillet proper.
    *    Talk to Skeeter, the local junk dealer with a penchant for conspiracy theories. He might mention seeing "glowing  eyes" near Perdue's ranch or talk about the "Invisible Women" stealing prime gator stock. (Ep istemic: Conspiracy)
    *   Talk to a disgruntled ex-GatorCorp technician (if player can find one,  perhaps one with the "Automaton User Stigma"). They might recognize the type of crude bypass on the lock panel as  something a desperate amateur might try, or a sign of sabotage designed to *look* amateur.

4.  ** Follow the Trail into the Deep Swamp:**
    *   The slime trail and the faint humming lead away from the ranch , deeper into the swamp.
    *   The trail will pass by signs of minor struggle – uprooted glowing fungi , disturbed mud.
    *   Encounter: A pack of 2-3 **Vampire Bunnies**. 
        *   *Function:* Minor environmental hazard, source of the iridescent slime. Their bites seem to drain energy,  perhaps even from solar panels if they got too close to Burt's Pride.
    *   Further along, the  humming gets stronger. You find a discarded, broken chunk of what looks like a 1970s-style solar  panel, unmistakably from Burt's Pride, covered in the same slime.

5.  **Discover the Source of  the Humming (The "Nest"):**
    *   The trail leads to a strangely pulsating, bio-luminescent mound  of swamp detritus, glowing fungi, and discarded 1970s-era technological junk (old circuit boards with  chunky transistors, wood-panelled casings, etc.). This is where the humming is loudest.
    *   Burt' s Pride is nearby, partially submerged in mud, looking listless. His chrome solar panels are dim and coated in the iridescent  slime. He occasionally thrashes weakly.
    *   The mound itself is defended by a larger, more aggressive  **Alpha Vampire Bunny** and several regular ones.

6.  **Deal with the Vampire Bunny "Nest" and Rescue  Burt's Pride:**
    *   **Choice Point:**
        *   **A) Direct Assault:** Fight  the Alpha Vampire Bunny and its minions. The Alpha is tougher, faster, and its energy drain is more potent.
         *   **B) Esoteric Solution:** If the player has learned any basic Swamp Witch counter-charms ( perhaps from a previous encounter or a rare lore book), they might be able to disrupt the "nest" with a specific  ritual or item, causing the bunnies to scatter or weaken. This might involve finding specific rare swamp herbs nearby.
        *    **C) Technological Solution (Partial):** The player might try to use a salvaged sonic emitter (with a distinctly 7 0s feel – large dials, clunky antenna) to drive the bunnies away, but the Alpha might be resistant.
     *   Once the bunnies are dealt with, examine Burt's Pride. His solar panels are fouled. The internal  diagnostic panel (chunky buttons, analog needle gauges) shows "CRITICAL ENERGY DRAIN - FOREIGN SUBSTANCE DET ECTED."

7.  **Cleanse/Repair Burt's Pride:**
    *   The slime needs to be  removed.
        *   `Technical Option:` If the player has solvent or can craft some, they can try to  clean the panels. This might require a mini-game of carefully applying the solvent without damaging the retro-tech components.
        *    `Ritual Option:` A local (perhaps a friendly Erpenthrope encountered, or even Granny Agnes if she knows  some old swamp lore) might know a cleansing ritual using specific swamp plants and blessed Burt Reynolds iconography to neutralize the "cur se" of the bunnies.
        *   `Brute Force (Risky):` Trying to just scrape it  off might damage the delicate (by 70s aesthetic standards) solar collectors.
    *   Once cleansed, Burt 's Pride's solar panels begin to slowly recharge (indicated by a satisfying "ka-CHUNK" and a slowly  brightening panel light). He might need a jump-start from a portable solar charger if the player has one, or be  left in a sunny spot for a while.

8.  **Return to Granny Agnes:**
    *   Escort  the slowly recovering Burt's Pride back to the ranch (he'll follow sluggishly).
    *   Inform Granny  Agnes of what happened.
        *   If you reveal the Vampire Bunnies, she'll shudder. "Sw amp Witches' work, no doubt! Or one of them new-fangled bio-calamity critters!"
        *    If you mention GatorCorp suspicions, she'll nod grimly, "Knew it! They're always tryin'  to run us little folk outta business!" (even if they weren't involved).

## Potential Choices & Outcomes

*   **Dealing with the Vampire Bunny Nest:**
    *    *Combat:* Succeeds, but might be resource-intensive. Burt's Pride might take some incidental damage.
     *   *Esoteric/Ritual:* Cleaner, possibly yields unique alchemical components or favor with a knowledgeable swamp dweller .
    *   *Technological (Sonic Emitter):* Might only partially work, or drive the Alpha into  a frenzy.
*   **Cleaning/Repairing Burt's Pride:**
    *   *Technical:* Successful  repair, showcases player skill.
    *   *Ritual:* Successful repair, reinforces the world's spiritual mi asma.
    *   *Brute Force:* May damage Burt's Pride, reducing his efficiency and Granny's reward/ satisfaction.
*   **Informing Granny Agnes:**
    *   *Blaming GatorCorp (regardless of evidence ):* Reinforces her paranoia, might lead to her taking defensive (possibly futile) actions later.
    *   *Reve aling the Vampire Bunnies/Swamp Witch link:* Increases her fear of the swamp's weirder side. Might  lead her to seek protection from an Erpenthrope or try to appease a local deity (Burt Reynolds effigy gets  extra polish).
    *   *Downplaying the supernatural (if solved technologically):* She might be skeptical but relieved  it wasn't "dark magic."

## Coherence Notes  (Linking to Primal Mama Codex)

*   **Alethic Modalities:**
    *   Relies on `All igator Biogenesis` (Burt's Pride's nature and solar power).
    *   Introduces ` Vampire Bunny Propagation` as a direct plot element.
    *   The 1970s ` Technological Aesthetic Constraint` is visually and functionally present in Burt's Pride's design and repair.
    *    Potential for `Spectral Interaction` if a ghost witnessed something (though not a primary path here).
*   **Deont ic Modalities:**
    *   The implied threat of GatorCorp ties into the `Automaton/LLM User St igma` (as they'd likely use such tech) and the power of the `Oligarchy of meat processors`.
     *   Granny's independence reflects the `Gun Ownership (Regional)` and self-reliance values outside Beetriot.
*    **Axiological Modalities:**
    *   `Alligator Meat` as a primary resource is central to Granny' s livelihood.
    *   The value of `Solar Power & Ingenuity` is shown through Burt's Pride .
    *   The `Late 1970s Aesthetic` is a key design feature.
    *    Granny might invoke `Deified Celebrities` in exclamations.
*   **Epistemic Modalities :**
    *   The true cause of Burt's Pride's disappearance is initially obscured, requiring investigation.
    *    `Swamp Witch Lore` is implicated via the Vampire Bunnies.
    *   `Conspiracy` theories  (Skeeter, "Invisible Women") provide local color and potential misdirection.
*   **Historical & Temporal Coherence:**  The quest occurs in the post-Calamity present, with technology and societal structures consistent with this era.
*    **Synchronic Coherence:** The interaction of GE tech (Burt's Pride), retro-aesthetic (his panels /interface), and supernatural elements (Vampire Bunnies) is central to the quest's conflict and resolution,  fitting the world's established blend. The economic backdrop of Lickskillet vs. GatorCorp is present.
*    **Complexity Management:** The quest focuses on a core mystery (missing gator) but weaves in several distinct Primal Mama elements  (GE gators, Vampire Bunnies, 1970s tech, oligarchy) without becoming overwhelming. Each  element serves the plot or provides flavor.

This quest aims to be a microcosm of Primal Mama, allowing the player to engage  with its core rules, aesthetics, and strange atmosphere in a narratively satisfying way.
