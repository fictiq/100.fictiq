## Exploring  Lickskillet's Southern Fringe & The Well Wraith (Part 1)

**Objective:** Investigate the haunted  well near the abandoned settlement south of Lickskillet.

**Initiation:**
Return to the outskirts of Licksk illet. Offload processed gator hides, tune up your swamp skiff, maybe polish the wood paneling on your  shotgun. Our next task involves scouting the notoriously miasma-choked bayous south and south-east of the main processing  hub. Coincidentally, a local contract fits right in: "Bayou Spirit Blues."

To start, find  the weathered stilt-house belonging to **Jedediah**, a grizzled independent gator processor, located just off  the main mud-track leading south from Lickskillet proper. His youngest kin has taken ill – not from simple  swamp fever, but from something worse, contracted after drinking from the contaminated bayou channels. The runoff from the big processing  plants upstream, combined with lingering Calamity-era biochemical quirks in the water, makes it toxic. According to Mama  Léonie, the local Root Doctor (part herbalist, part Swamp Witch apprentice), the specific affliction requires constant hydration with  *pure* water. The only reliable source nearby is an old hand-pump well in a long-abandoned settlement  further south. Problem is, it's haunted – fiercely. Back when the bayou flowed cleaner, folks just avoided the  place. Now? That ghost is a death sentence for Jedediah's child.

**The Contract:**
This  smells like work for someone... specialized. Someone like you, maybe an **Erpenthrope** attuned to the strange  energies of the swamp, or just a well-armed local willing to tangle with things best left undisturbed.

Ask Jedediah  about the haunting. He'll describe chilling whispers on the wind, tools moving on their own, and a paralyzing cold  near the well site. He might mention glimpses of a "shimmering woman figure" wailing in despair.

Accept the  job. Jedediah offers a base rate – maybe **40 Gator Scrip**. You can haggle. Push  too hard (asking for 60, maybe?), and he'll get ornery, muttering about fat- cat Beetriot prices. Settle around **50 Scrip**; it's honest pay for risking spectral interference.  Agree to handle the "spirit problem."

**The Journey South:**
Leave Jedediah's place and head south along  the main track, likely needing watercraft for stretches depending on the water levels. You'll pass isolated shacks clinging  to cypress roots. The track eventually forks near a cluster of skeletal, Calamity-petrified trees. The south-eastern fork  leads towards the abandoned settlement and our haunted well. Naturally, we head south-west first – can't leave potentially  useful salvage unexplored.

Following the south-west track (a mix of precarious walkways and shallow channels), you'll  notice signs of violence: splintered planks, dark stains that smell faintly of ozone and fear (especially if you have Er penthrope senses), maybe discarded crude weapons. Continue south-west to find the **Rickety Bridge Signpost**  (a piece of rusted 70s-era road sign nailed to a piling), marking a treacherous crossing over a deeper  channel choked with strange, phosphorescent weeds.

Navigate the crossing (carefully, the planks groan). The path winds  south-east briefly before turning back south-west into denser, darker swamp.

**Scavenger Camp:**
Ve er west off the main path, deeper into the mangroves and cypress knees. You'll soon hear rough voices or spot  the flicker of a contained fire. A camp of **Scavengers** – desperate folks living off salvaged tech and poached  gators – has been set up here. Deal with them as needed (negotiation is unlikely; firearms are common outside  Beetriot). Their main stash is usually under a tarp lean-to: salvaged components, gator parts, maybe ammo , and often a locked footlocker (70s avocado green plastic?) potentially containing functional salvage or a decent weapon modification  schematic.

**Place of Power (Whispering Cypress):**
Return east to the track, then continue pushing east past it  into a particularly ancient-feeling grove. Find the **Whispering Cypress**, a colossal, ancient tree draped in Spanish moss that  hums with a low energy palpable even to mundane senses (and intensely felt by Erpenthropes). Drawing upon  its energy might grant a temporary boost to stamina or focus, or perhaps even yield a permanent **Erpenthrope Ability  Point** if applicable.

*Self-Correction Note:* From the Whispering Cypress, heading north/north-east would  lead towards an **Abandoned GE Gator Pen**. This area might hold clues related to the history of alligator bio-genesis or the  oligarchy's less ethical experiments. However, discovering it now might disrupt the intended flow or rewards of a later investigation  concerning rogue GE strains or oligarch secrets. Best avoided for now unless specifically directed.

## Bayou Spirit Blues (Part 2)

 **Objective:** Investigate the abandoned settlement and deal with the entity haunting the well.

**The Abandoned Settlement:**
Head back  to the main fork near the petrified trees and take the south-eastern path. Follow it until you reach the **Abandoned  Settlement Signpost**. Beyond lies the remains of a small community, swallowed by the swamp. Rusted-out airboats, collapsed  stilt-houses half-submerged in green water, an unnerving silence broken only by insects and distant gator bellows .

Enter the settlement cautiously. Engage your specialized senses (Witcher Senses analogue: perhaps enhanced hearing, thermal /energy trace vision for Erpenthropes, or focused ritual awareness). Around the central well, notice patches of strangely  **blighted ground**, where vegetation refuses to grow, or maybe unnaturally **cold spots**. West of the well,  investigate a **desiccated husk** tangled in mutated vines – not burned, but seemingly drained of all moisture and life- force. From the evidence, you might deduce this isn't a simple haunting; it feels targeted, hungry – perhaps a **S orrowful Shade** or **Miasma Wraith**, a spirit formed from intense grief and the toxic energies of the post -Calamity swamp.

**Searching for Clues:**
Explore the few remaining structures:
*   **Western most Shack:** Contains mostly junk – rusted cans, rotted fabric. Use brute force (or maybe a controlled Erpenthrope  strength surge) to clear collapsed beams, revealing a waterlogged crate with some basic crafting materials (gator sinew, salvage able wiring).
*   **Central House (Partially Flooded):** Inside, find a couple of sturdy foot lockers half-submerged. These often contain better salvage – Alchemical ingredients unique to the deep swamp (like Biol uminescent Algae) or useful 70s-era components (vacuum tubes, intact circuit boards).
*   **Eastern most House:** Underneath a tilted, rusted-out swamp buggy frame outside, find a concealed chest. Inside the shack , near the doorway, various sacks hold minor loot. Deeper inside, find a small wooden box on a shelf.  Turn towards the back wall – against it rests a larger, metal footlocker. Nearby, on a mildewed table, lies  a **Water-Damaged Journal**. As you note, this might hold answers.

**The Journal's Tale:**
 Access your inventory (perhaps via a clunky wrist-mounted datapad with an amber CRT display). Read the Journal. The entries  speak of hardship: settlers pushed into this marginal land by pressure from Beetriot expansion or early meat oligarchy land grabs.  It mentions conflict with local agents or enforcers. The last entries speak of a tense meeting, maybe involving a specific,  cherished personal item, before the writing abruptly stops. The tone suggests betrayal or violence linked to someone trying to protect their family  or homestead. This reinforces the idea of a spirit bound by unfinished business or intense emotion, possibly tied to a specific object. Check  your internal Bestiary (if you have one, perhaps loaded onto your datapad): entries on Sorrowful Shades or Miasma Wra iths confirm they often latch onto objects imbued with strong emotional resonance.

**The Trail:**
Time to find that object.  Turn around from where you found the journal. Using your senses, examine the corner opposite. Highlighted might be **faint  ectoplasmic residue** or **splintered flooring** suggesting a violent struggle. You identify signs consistent with someone being attacked , dying right there. However, a faint trail – shimmering energy, disturbed mold patterns, or a thin trail of viscous , unnatural slime – leads away from the spot. Follow it, making observations near the body's location and again near the doorway,  confirming the trail leads directly to the **well**. Examine the rusted metal lip and the frayed, algae-covered rope tied  to the decrepit pump mechanism. A grim realization dawns: the victim wasn't just killed *near* the well ; they ended up *in* it. No wonder the spirit is tied here. Whatever happened, this spectral torment needs to end . The binding object – perhaps the one mentioned indirectly in the journal – must be down there.

**Into the Well:**
 Steel yourself and hop into the well shaft. The murky water below cushions the fall. Activate underwater lighting (maybe a helmet lamp  with that distinct 70s halogen yellow glow) and dive [Controller Button]. Use your senses to scan the debris -filled bottom. Locate the target: not a bracelet, but perhaps a **Tarnished Silver Locket**, half -buried in the muck. Pocket it.

Surface [Controller Button]. Find a ledge or opening in the well wall  to the north. Climb up into a narrow, dripping tunnel leading east into a flooded cavern system – likely interconnected sinkholes or  hollow cypress root networks. Dive into the next pool of water. Swim north-east through the submerged passage to another large  chamber. Search the western side to find a submerged, heavy-duty plastic crate (perhaps DOW chemical branding, faded). Inside:  useful salvage and maybe the **formula** for **Swamp Lung Salve** or a **Miasma Filter**. Follow  the bubbles to the surface for air. Swim down another tunnel east, surfacing in a small, eerily still pond open  to the sky, surrounded by hanging vines. Get air. Search near the center of this pond for another submerged crate with  minor loot. You feel the spectral energy intensifying; the Wraith knows you have its anchor. Time to prepare. All you truly  *need* is your **treated Gator-Tooth Blade** (or equivalent spectral-harming weapon) and knowledge of the necessary  **containment ritual** (perhaps drawing a specific sigil on the ground near the well using powdered gator bone mixed  with specific swamp clays).

**The Confrontation:**
Return to the Abandoned Settlement via the tunnels or by climbing  out of the final pond. When ready, approach the well. Perform the required action to draw the Wraith out – perhaps not  burning the body, but placing the recovered Locket on the well's edge and beginning the containment ritual chant, or  burning a specific mixture of swamp herbs and gator fat as an offering.

The **Miasma Wraith** manifests  – a shimmering, vaguely humanoid shape coalescing from the swamp fumes, radiating cold and despair. Its attacks are swift,  spectral claws swiping, and it can unleash a disorienting **miasma cloud**. Periodically, it might fade  or create illusory duplicates. Lure it into the area of your **containment sigil** (replacing Yrden). While  within the sigil's influence, the Wraith becomes more tangible, vulnerable to your Gator-Tooth Blade. Use aggressive strikes,  then dodge back from its spectral reach or the miasma bursts.

Once defeated, the Wraith dissipates. Loot the  lingering **Ectoplasmic Residue**: perhaps **Ghostly Essence**, **Bioluminescent Algae**, maybe a rare  **Spectral Mutagen** (Vitality/Sense boost?). Crucially, you'll find the **Wraith Fet ish** (the cleansed Locket, now inert but proof of your deed, replaces Noonwraith Trophy). Equipping it might  offer a slight resistance to fear effects or spectral energy.

**Resolution & Reward:**

| Objective                           | Reward        | 
| :---------------------------------- | :------------ |
| For defeating the Miasma Wraith     | XP 50          |

Return to Jedediah's stilt-house. Tell him the well is clear. Your Erpenthrope nature  (or simple perceptiveness) might compel you to ask about the name found in the journal (let's say it  was "Clara"). Jedediah might recognize the name, muttering about old settlement feuds or troubles caused by early  Oligarchy land grabs long ago – seeds for future plotlines.

Jedediah, relieved, offers payment – the Gator  Scrip promised, money he admits was set aside for his kid's future apprenticeship or tools. He reasons it's better the  kid *has* a future. You can:
1.  Take the **50 Gator Scrip**.
 2.  Decline the Scrip, perhaps saying spectral cleanup is sometimes its own reward (or that you covered costs  with salvage).

If you decline, Jedediah, respecting the gesture but adhering to bayou custom (debts paid ), insists you take something. He offers a piece of functional **Pre-Calamity Salvage** – maybe a sturdy , working analog dive watch, a multi-tool, or a compass unaffected by the swamp's weird magnetism – likely  worth more than the Scrip to the right buyer or for personal use. Sometimes, decency pays better dividends.

|  Objective                                            | Reward                                         |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| For  returning to Jedediah after clearing the well    | 50 XP                                          |
|                                                      | 5 0 Gator Scrip **OR** Pre-Calamity Salvage Item |

**Lingering Tasks:**
The contract  is done, but the southern bayou holds more secrets (and salvage). Return to the Abandoned Settlement. Take the track  leading east out of it. Ignore the first small game trail branching off. Take the second, more established path leading towards a ** Dilapidated Fishing Shack** or partially sunken **Houseboat** on the edge of a larger lagoon. Inside, amongst  the decay and gator nests, search carefully. In a protected locker or chest, you might find a valuable piece of gear –  perhaps a well-maintained **Lever-Action Rifle** with custom wood paneling, or schematics for a useful **70s -tech gadget**.
