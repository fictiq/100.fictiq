Okay, this is a fantastic  challenge! I'll take the structure and flow of the Witcher 3 quest "Count Reuven's Treasure" ( and its subsequent parts like "Get Junior" and "The Gangs of Novigrad") and re-imagine it entirely  within the Primal Mama world, using your Coherence Protocol as the reference.

Here's the re-context ualized quest walkthrough:

---

## Primal Mama: Gator Gus's Grievance & The Crankshaft Con undrum

**Initial Rumor:** Word on the humid Lickskillet airwaves (likely crackling over an  old CB radio) is that a musician, **Buck "Banjo" Beaumont**, known for his soulful swamp ballads and tales of pre -calamity folk heroes (like the deified Burt Reynolds), has gone missing. He was last seen trying to get  a gig with **"Gator" Gus Reptilio**, a big shot in the Lickskillet alligator processing scene , possibly one of the "oligarchs" mentioned as causing friction.

**Quest Start: Finding "Gator" Gus  Reptilio**

Let's start by tracking down this "Gator" Gus. To find him, head north from the main  Lickskillet market barge, past the flickering neon sign of the "Greasy Gator Grill." When the boardwalk splits near  the bubbling methane seeps, take the western, more rickety path (the eastern one leads towards the Purity Patrol's  imposing, blocky precinct house). Shortly, you'll see a surprisingly well-maintained, albeit rust-streaked, corrugated  iron structure adorned with blinking, oversized Christmas lights (despite the season) and what looks like a repurposed bank vault door –  this is **Gus's Humidor & Hydroponics Hub**, his base of operations.

Knock on the  heavy door. A slot slides open, revealing suspicious eyes. Drop the name "Buck 'Banjo' Beaumont" and mention you heard  Gus might know his whereabouts. After a tense moment, the door groans open.

You'll be led through  steamy, surprisingly lush hydroponic gardens (likely growing exotic herbs or perhaps even base components for some of the more " esoteric" local concoctions) under flickering fluorescent lights encased in chunky, amber plastic. The air is thick with the smell  of damp earth, ozone, and expensive cigar smoke (or its local equivalent). You'll meet Gus – a large  man in a loud, synthetic 70s-style leisure suit, adorned with gator-tooth jewelry – and  other shady figures of Lickskillet's underbelly, all gathered around a table made from a giant, pet rified cypress stump, its surface inlaid with mother-of-pearl depicting alligator hunts.

Your meeting is violently interrupted by an  attack – **Crankshaft Cody's Bayou Boys** (Level 11 Goons with modified spearguns and  rusty machetes, Level 12 Brute with a salvaged jackhammer) burst in, clearly looking for trouble. Help  Gus's men fend them off. After the dust settles and the air clears of curses and cordite, the atmosphere  is even more tense. A formidable Swamp Witch matriarch, **Mama Roux**, glares at Gus, mutters something about " amateurs attractin' heat," and sweeps out with her entourage. A nervous-looking individual known as "The Ghost -Whisperer" also makes a hasty exit.

This leaves you and a deeply annoyed Gator Gus to talk business . This starts the quest **"The Bayou Bruisers."**

Once you talk to Gus in private (perhaps in a  back room with wood-paneled walls and a bubbling lava lamp), he'll reveal his real problem. Buck "Ban jo" Beaumont isn't just missing; Gus suspects he was snatched or silenced by his main rival, **"Crankshaft"  Cody**. Crankshaft is not only trying to muscle in on Gus's alligator processing turf but is also rumored to be  dabbling in dangerous, forbidden pre-calamity tech and possibly even trying to establish a black market for *actual  cattle components* – a massive taboo. Gus needs to find Crankshaft before Mama Roux (who has her own vendetta against Cody for  stealing sacred swamp herbs) tears Lickskillet apart looking for him, or worse, before the Purity Patrol gets  wind of Cody's more heretical activities.

Fortunately, Gus has three leads on where Crankshaft might be corner ed or where information about his operations (and Buck's fate) can be found:
1.  **C rankshaft's Chop Shop & Chance Emporium** (his illicit gambling den and front for shady deals).
2.   **The Gator Pit** (an illegal arena where souped-up GE alligators and other unfortunate creatures are made  to fight).
3.  **Crankshaft's Fortified Scrapyard** (his main hideout  on the edge of the toxic bogs).
If all that fails, Gus himself might have to "persuade" some  of his more reluctant contacts.

**Objective Reward:**
*   For surviving the ambush and meeting Gus: **150 Solar  Credits (SC)**

**Side Hustle: Gator Gambits with Gus**
You can also ask Gus about Buck  Beaumont again, but before you do, end the conversation, save your progress (perhaps by syncing your internal chronometer with  a public data-totem), and challenge Gus to a game of **Gator Gambits** (a popular local dice/ card game involving betting on alligator hunt outcomes and swamp spirit interventions).
Gus plays a mean game with a custom deck of "Legend ary Gator" cards, favoring "Solar Flare" (weather-like effect) and "Ambush Predator" (Scorch -like) cards, but his actual "Swamp Creature" cards are surprisingly weak. Beat him, and he'll gr umble about some Erpenthrope out in the deep swamp who's a savant at Gambits, reviving the side  quest **"Gator Gambits: Bayou Big Shots."** Your prize for winning is the **"Burt Reynolds ' Bandit' Ascendant"** card, a 10 Strength Hero Card for the "Swamp Folk" faction , quite a collector's item.

**Objective Reward:**
*   For defeating Gus at Gator Gambits:  **25 SC**
*   **Burt Reynolds 'Bandit' Ascendant** Card

**The Sabotage in the  Sump (Replaces "Bomb in the Bathhouse")**

Ask Gus about Buck again. He'll confirm Buck  crossed Crankshaft... and suggest he might be able to leverage his contacts more effectively if you do some "discreet work" for him . Agree to help. Gus leads you down a rusty spiral staircase into a sub-level of his Hub, a noisy , steamy area housing his primary water filtration and geothermal vent system, crucial for his high-yield GE alligator tanks and specialized  hydroponics.
He reveals his problem: a sophisticated act of sabotage. Someone introduced a targeted bio-agent or a localized  EMP into the system, nearly wiping out a batch of prime gator stock and ruining a sensitive crop. He needs you to find out  who was behind it and recover any evidence, *quietly*. He provides you with the schematic for **"Mama's Mias ma Masker,"** a rebreather effective against the toxic fumes in the deeper overflow tunnels.

While you're down  here, you might as well help Gus. Activate your Erpenthrope Senses (or a jury-rigged  1970s-style scanner) and search the remains of a corroded access pipe near a recently patched breach  in a containment wall. Head north-west into the Lickskillet Overflow Tunnels.
Search a clogged grate  in an alcove to the north-west, then follow the sluggish, murky current to the north-east. When  you reach a rusted gate, turn north-west and investigate another section of pipe lying on the slimy floor. Equip your M iasma Masker (it should auto-slot if you have the components to craft one) and head into the pulsing , sickly green clouds of effluvium. Each filter cartridge gives you 360 seconds of protection, and Gus  gives you three – about eighteen minutes.

Go through the gate to the north-east, dispatch a Sewer Skulk  (Level 9 mutated amphibian), and investigate some more pipes fused to the tunnel wall. Loot a waterlogged crate  and other containers on a precarious platform to the north-west, then head down some crumbling steps to the east. Search  some rubble at the end of the steps to find a ** tarnished Solar Credit chip (worth 50 SC)**.  Continue down a tunnel to the east, then north to enter a larger cistern. Here, you find a corpse tangled in debris  – a low-level goon, judging by the cheap jumpsuit. Another corpse is further north, with a discarded **data -slate (broken)** nearby. Turn west into another chamber occupied by several Sewer Skulks (Level 9).

 Clear the room, then use debris to climb (jumping a gap) to an upper walkway where various barrels and parcels hold minor  loot (scrap components, stale nutrient paste). Return to the lower level and search near a western outflow gate to find a **char red circuit board** – part of the EMP device, or a residue sample of the bio-agent. If you continue west,  you'll eventually reach an old canal outlet, and your character will comment on how the saboteur must have made their escape or  entry.

**Objective Reward:**
*   For searching the Overflow Tunnels: **200 SC**

Return  to Gus and tell him what you found. After some deliberation, the two of you will try to figure out which intake  valve or access point was used. Search the eastern-most of two indicated maintenance hatches in Gus’s facility. You ’ll find another piece of the device/a container fragment. Your character calls Gus over. After Gus consults his ( surprisingly analog) meticulous logs of who had access or was on duty (perhaps Happen, his stoic, cybernetically- enhanced gator-handler, checks the records), they find the likely saboteur: one **Margrave Henckel**, a  disgruntled former bio-technician... who was reported "missing, presumed gator-fodder" last week. Looks  like you'll need to investigate Henckel's last known address, a derelict shack on the edge of the  Old Mire.

**Objective Reward:**
*   For searching Gus's facility: **50 SC**

Leave  the Humidor & Hydroponics Hub and head south through Lickskillet's main drag. When you reach the  "Swamp Rat Saloon" signpost, turn west towards the Old Mire. Use a **Kinetic Pulse**  (your Aard-equivalent, maybe a focused sonic burst from a handheld device, or an Erpenthrope ability ) to blast open the barricaded door of the curiously isolated shack.
Activate your enhanced senses. Search some strange footprints ( not quite human, not quite gator) inside. Investigate a strange canister on a workbench along the eastern wall.  Loot the shack, then follow the trail upstairs, where you'll find a "Bottle of Moonshine" (str angely labeled "Chateau du Bayou '77") and a "Mysterious Schematic" to search. Your character will comment  on the advanced (yet still 70s-aesthetic) nature of the device depicted. Head over to a reinforced  locker in the corner and input a code found subtly marked on the moonshine bottle's label (e.g.,  by specific distress marks). This opens a hidden compartment in the floor, where the footprints lead...

Descend into the hidden  cellar to find a makeshift lab with all kinds of forbidden items: spilled Irradiated Gator Lure on the floor, a  mixture of volatile chemicals on a table, instructions for a complex bio-agent on a datapad (with a picture of a smiling,  Hawaiian-shirted man labeled "R.I.P. Kalkstein – True Visionary!"), and finally, a "Memo  from C.C." (Crankshaft Cody) on a crate near a cot. Your character reads the memo aloud, confirming  Cody hired Henckel for the sabotage. Just then, you hear footsteps above.

**Objective Reward:**
*    For searching Henckel's secret lab: **50 SC**

Go upstairs to see who came calling . It’s Gator Gus, who has brought along **Esme "Sparkplug" Faraday**, a sharp, independent  bio-technician known for her custom solar tech and rumored sympathies with Erpenthropes (she might even be one,  or have a close Erpenthrope friend). Reveal what you discovered to Gus, implicating Crankshaft Cody. If  Esme is present, don't correct Gus if he implies a closer working relationship between you and Esme than currently  exists, if you want to gain Esme's trust (she values discretion). Gus will leave to "make arrangements." Es me will tell you to meet her by the old abandoned Radio Tower on the edge of Lickskillet at midnight –  a known landmark used for clandestine meetings.

**To Bait a Purifier (Replaces "To Catch a Witch Hunter ")**

When ready, head to the Radio Tower district and meditate (or simply pass time via your internal chronometer) until  midnight. Esme will be there, outlining a risky plan. Commander Thorne of the Purity Patrol has detained a contact  of hers who knows about Crankshaft's deeper dealings with off-world smugglers or forbidden pre-calamity AI  research (something related to the Automaton/LLM stigma). The only way to get to Thorne is to offer him something  he can't refuse: a high-profile "deviant."

You will take Esme (or a convincing  Erpenthrope in disguise, if your character is one or has such an ally) to the Purity Patrol' s blocky, imposing headquarters. The chance to apprehend a known "bio-heretic sympathizer" or an actual  Erpenthrope will grant you access, but not directly to Thorne.
If you provoke the Purity Patrol En forcers (Level 9, armed with stun batons and net guns), you'll have to fight your way through . Kill the initial group, then go through a reinforced door to the south, where more Enforcers await. Fight your way up  some metal stairs and into an inner sanctum where you'll find **Commander Thorne** (Level 10, equipped  with advanced, but still chunky 70s-style, non-lethal weaponry and heavy armor).

Alternatively , pick dialogue options: "Wanna talk to Thorne," "Got a proposition for Thorne," and "I'll  tell your boss. No one else." You'll be escorted into the stronghold, where the Enforcers will try to take Es me to their "re-education wing."
If you refuse ("She stays with me"), you fight them there. 
If you let them take Esme ("Fine, take her."), you'll be brought to Thorne. You'll hear distressing  sonic pulses and Esme’s (or the decoy's) strained cries from a nearby room. Play it cool.  "Why not?" when Thorne offers you a glass of lukewarm nutrient solution. After he confirms your (assumed) mercenary  identity, say "Your Enforcers are 'questioning' my associate, but my information isn't free,"  then "A professional like me does anything for enough Solar Credits." Then, pivot: "I'm looking for information  on Crankshaft Cody's illegal tech smuggling..." This will get Thorne talking, revealing his own dirt or his knowledge of Cody 's operation, as he hopes to use you to eliminate a rival or a loose end.

Finally, ask about Es me's contact (or whatever leverage you need). If you pressed too hard about Thorne's own corruption earlier, he 'll turn violent. Otherwise, he might just try to double-cross you. In any case, Esme ( if it's really her and not a decoy, and she's not too incapacitated) might create a diversion ( e.g., overloading a nearby solar capacitor, releasing a cage of agitated Vampire Bunnies kept for "study," or an  Erpenthrope ally causing chaos). This will start the quest **"A Shock to the System"** (if Es me needs rescuing/healing later).

No matter how it happens, Thorne is dealt with (either captured, killed, or forced  to flee). If you killed him, search his desk to find a "Confidential Purity Patrol Dossier" ( which he would have shredded if you talked your way in) and "Thorne's Personal Data-Chip." Es me (or your ally) will find Thorne's Master Key Card. Exit the stronghold via a locked door to the west.  Once outside, Esme (if present and able) will decide some "redecorating" is in order and use  a focused solar device to set a pile of Purity Patrol propaganda posters ablaze before vanishing into the swamp mists, telling you to find  her at her workshop later. You'll have to climb atop a nearby storage tank to the west, then jump over  an electrified fence (timing it right). Search a wall to the north to find it's structurally weak – blast it with  a Kinetic Pulse.

**Objective Reward:**
*   For dealing with Thorne yourself (combat): **200 SC**
 *   For playing along until Esme/ally creates chaos: **300 SC**

Time to report back  to Gator Gus. Fortunately, he’s impatient and has his feelers out. Once you're through the wall , one of his runners will find you and take you to meet Gus at a neutral location (perhaps a disused hover craft dock). Banter as you see fit. Depending on what you learned, Gus will either have information on the "Ghost -Whisperer" who might know how to find a reclusive Erpenthrope Seer (if you need  deeper, more esoteric info on Crankshaft's plans, especially if they involve supernatural elements), or direct you to meet  a contact of Thorne's that Gus has now "acquired." Our reward from Gus is the same.

**Objective  Reward:**
*   For giving Gus Thorne's Key Card/Dossier: **100 SC,  90 units of Refined Solar Fuel**
*   *Note: If you learn about Thorne's direct  complicity in the sabotage of Gus's operation and pass this specific intel to Gus, he'll provide a unique  1970s tech weapon mod later.*

If your encounter with Thorne was... messy, and you didn 't get concrete intel on Crankshaft's current whereabouts from Thorne himself, Gus will direct you to intercept Thorne's contact . Travel to the abandoned Weather Station east of Lickskillet. Search the rusted housing of the south-eastern most  sensor array to find a hidden compartment. Deposit Thorne's Data-Chip. Head to a secluded fishing shack on the eastern  outskirts of the bayou and wait (meditate) until midnight.
Once done, sneak inside and use your enhanced  senses to find a hiding spot (under a loose floorboard, in a shadowy alcove). The contact will show up –  after an unexpected intrusion by a hungry Swamp Lurker (quickly dispatched). The contact, a nervous data broker, will try to act  tough until your character (perhaps using an Erpenthrope intimidation display or just cold logic) makes them spill everything about  Crankshaft's current hideout and plans for Buck "Banjo" Beaumont (who is alive, but being forced  to decode some pre-calamity musical data-slate Crankshaft believes leads to a treasure or powerful tech). Decide  the fate of the data broker. Thorne is out of the picture, but Crankshaft is the key to finding Buck. This  also starts **"A Shock to the System"** if Esme needs help.

**Objective Reward:**
*   For  interrogating Thorne's contact: **50 SC**

Before finding Esme (if needed), let's clear up  the **"Gator Gambits: Bayou Big Shots"** quest. Fast-travel (via solar-powered swamp  skimmer) to the "Twisted Cypress Landing" signpost, south-west of Lickskillet. Head  south and slightly east into the deep, bioluminescent part of the swamp to find an Erpenthrope Hermit in  a secluded grove, surrounded by ancient, humming technology of unknown origin (but still with some 70s-style read outs). Now that Gus mentioned him, he'll play Gator Gambits, fielding a tricky "Ephemeral Spirits & Solar  Cycles" deck. He uses many "Phase Shift" cards, "Ancestral Echo" (Muster-like) cards,  and "Solar Nullifier" (Scorch) effects. Once you beat him, he'll gift you the **" Erpenthrope Prime Matriarch"** card – a 15 Strength Close Combat Hero Card – and the ** "Jerry Reed 'Snowman' Unbound"** card. This ends "Gator Gambits: Bayou Big Shots ."

**Objective Reward:**
*   For defeating the Erpenthrope Hermit: **25 SC** 
*   **Erpenthrope Prime Matriarch** Card
*   **Jerry Reed 'Snowman' Unbound**  Card

Return to a signpost and fast travel to "Lickskillet Central." If Esme needs help (quest  "A Shock to the System"), find her at her workshop (a repurposed radio shack filled with humming solar arrays and strange  bio-organic tech experiments). Talk to her. She might be injured or her workshop ransacked by Purity Patrol remnants . Help her recover/rebuild. This completes "A Shock to the System." Then, ask about Buck/Crankshaft.  She might provide a device to bypass some of Crankshaft's 70s-tech security. This also completes ** "Gator Gus's Grievance."**

**Snag Crankshaft (Replaces "Get Junior")** 
Before we can rescue Buck "Banjo" Beaumont, we need to deal with Crankshaft Cody. We have three primary  locations: the Chop Shop, the Gator Pit, and his Fortified Scrapyard. But first, let's see Mama Roux . She’s also after Crankshaft. Why not coordinate?

**Mama Roux's Retribution (Level 9,  Replaces "The Gangs of Novigrad")**
Head west along the southern boardwalk of Lickskillet, then take  some slimy stairs north through a series of interconnected, half-flooded shacks, where you'll find Mama Roux' s enforcers (tough-looking swamp folk and a few hulking, silent types who might be Erpenthropes).  Head inside a larger, stilt-house adorned with Cthulhu-esque carvings and glowing fungi to find Mama  Roux overseeing a bubbling cauldron. After she finishes her "brew," she'll talk. She proposes an alliance – a skilled individual  like yourself is a mighty asset alongside her swamp-savvy crew. If you accept, this quest runs parallel to "Sn ag Crankshaft." Mama Roux will rule out the Fortified Scrapyard as too heavily defended for a direct assault by  her people alone, suggesting you focus on the Chop Shop and Gator Pit. Accepting her offer means any approach to those locations will be loud  and messy. Her swamp folk aren't known for subtlety.

**Crankshaft's Fortified Scrapyard (Re places "Whoreson Junior's Hideout")**
Whether you accept Mama Roux's offer or not, check  out the Scrapyard. Cross the "Gator Gulch Bridge" to reach the industrial outskirts. Follow the rust -stained road north, west, south, then west again past mountains of decaying 70s tech to reach the heavily  fenced compound. Outside, you'll see Mama Roux's scouts if you allied with her, or just eerie silence if not . More of her people (or signs of their recent, messy attempt) are inside if you allied.
Talk to one  of Mama Roux's "swamp scouts." They'll tell you what they've seen – Crankshaft is dug  in deep. Search some discarded data-tapes on the ground, then head into the main office (a stack of welded -together shipping containers). Investigate some disturbing bio-containment units on a rack, then look at some schematics for what  appears to be a device to interface with *cattle brains* (highly illegal and disturbing). After these are searched, you 'll decide this place is a dead end for now without more firepower or a distraction – but you can loot some scrap components  and old solar cells.

**Crankshaft's Chop Shop (Sided with Mama Roux)**
Follow the quest marker to  find the Chop Shop, a garish, pulsating structure on the eastern side of Lickskillet's entertainment district, north -east of the main market. If you sided with Mama Roux, her crew is waiting. Talk to their leader,  tell them you're ready, then storm the place, neutralizing every goon in sight. Grab a "Debtor 's Ledger" (on an old punch-card system) off the counter. Continue upstairs, more mayhem.
On the  third floor, search a locker to find a unique 1970s-style energy pistol, **"The  Solar Flaregun."** Go through the door and talk to **"Ticker" Tim**, a local tech-scav enger, tied up and looking rough. He was caught trying to salvage parts. He's willing to talk. Listen , then decide whether to free him. Doing so starts the quest **"Honor Among Swamp Rats."**
*Note: If  all of Mama Roux's crew are incapacitated, you'll fail "Mama Roux's Retribution."*

 **Crankshaft's Chop Shop (Didn't Side with Mama Roux)**
If you didn't bring  Mama Roux's crew, you'll face Bouncers. Either pick a fight (leading to a full-scale brawl ), bribe them (200 SC), or use an Erpenthrope mind-trick/persuasion (Ax ii-equivalent: "These are not the droids you're looking for... I mean, I'm on the guest  list").
**Objective Reward:**
*   For using mind-trick/persuasion on Bouncers: **40 SC **
Once inside, grab the "Operating Expenses" data-slate. Head to the second floor for Gator Gambits. No  unique cards, but high stakes (up to 100 SC). Win twice, and you're invited upstairs to a  "private game"... where goons accuse you of cheating with "unnatural luck" (especially if you're an Erpenth rope). Neutralize them and talk to Ticker Tim. Decide his fate (starts "Honor Among Swamp Rats" if freed).
 Loot a goon for the "Debtor's Ledger." Leave the room, open a locker for **"The Solar Flare gun."** Head downstairs and deal with remaining goons (Level 12), looting thoroughly.

**Objective Reward:**
*    For freeing Ticker Tim: **SC Varies**

**The Gator Pit (Sided with Mama Roux)**
Leave  the Chop Shop. Head south, turn east under a rusted archway, then through a tunnel to the north. Continue  north to find another group of Mama Roux's people. Talk to their leader, then proceed. Neutralize two Guards  (Level 12) outside a gate, head down some stairs, through more gates, into another room with more guards. After  them, a tunnel south leads to another chamber with more guards. Further east is a large, arena-like space with  many foes, including the pit boss – **Igor "The Gator King"** (Level 13, cyber netically enhanced and wielding a shock-prod). Defeat them. Loot Igor's body for "Igor's  Secure Key," which opens a small strongbox on a nearby table containing a "Memo from Igor." Read it – it mentions  a hidden stash of Crankshaft's ill-gotten Solar Credits.
Backtrack east and go through a gate  north, then down a ramp west. Follow the tunnel south, through a gate, then south into a holding pen area . Turn on your enhanced senses and explore the eastern wall to find a section that sounds hollow. Manipulate a nearby rusty  lever disguised as a decorative alligator jaw to open a secret door. Loot the hidden room – mostly junk, but in a chest at  the eastern end, find a "Coded Communique," confirming Crankshaft's alliance with a shadowy Beetriot oligarch .

**The Gator Pit (Didn't Side with Mama Roux)**
Leave the Chop Shop, navigate as above . Find two Bouncers. Provoke them (fight), bribe (100 SC), or mind-trick/ persuade.
**Objective Reward:**
*   For using mind-trick/persuasion on Bouncers: **4 0 SC**
Past the Bouncers, down stairs and through gates. Enter a chamber with guards, then a tunnel  south. Reach another chamber, turn east. Igor "The Gator King" is there. Tell him you want a job as  an arena fighter. He'll test you.
1.  Gustav "The Mauler" Roone (Level  12 human brawler).
2.  Two hulking "Swamp Yetis" (Level 11 , possibly mutated humans or a local cryptid) with improvised club-like weapons.
3.  A "Bio -Engineered Swamp Hydra" (Level 11, a failed GE experiment).
4.  Two "Ir radiated Mirelurkers" (Levels 10 and 12, giant mutated crabs).
5.  Final round : "Old One-Eye," a legendary, scarred GE Alligator (Level 11).
Defeat them  all. Crankshaft Junior appears to congratulate you. At that moment, Mama Roux (if you didn't ally,  she might opportunistically attack now anyway, seeing an opening) and her crew assault the Gator Pit. Crankshaft flees. Dispatch  Igor (Level 13) and his goons. Get "Igor's Secure Key." Head east through the gate  they used.
Approach the eastern wall; your character notes odd scuff marks. Enhanced senses reveal a secret door.  Interact with the alligator jaw lever to open it. Find the "Coded Communique" in the chest.
Read  it. Leave the secret chamber. Up a tunnel north, through a gate, west around a corner, up stairs, then through  a gate south. Help Mama Roux's swamp folk (if present) defeat Crankshaft's remaining goons in the  main viewing area. Loot the strongbox near Igor's command chair for the "Memo from Igor." Backtrack west, then  up a tunnel north (not back to the arena). Emerge to the surface.

**Objective Reward:**
*   For  finding Crankshaft's documents (Communique/Memo): **SC Varies**

**Collecting Favors**
 Gator Gus would love to know about Crankshaft's Beetriot connection. First, visit Mama Roux (if you helped her)  and the King of the Castaways (a benevolent leader of Lickskillet's downtrodden, Ticker Tim's  patron, if you freed Tim). Mama Roux, pleased with the disruption, gives you a potent **"Swamp Witch 's Hex Bag"** and some rare alchemical ingredients. The King of the Castaways rewards you with a unique silver -plated (but still 70s tech) handgun, **"The Bayou Diplomat,"** and a set of **" Scavenger's Reinforced Leathers."** This completes "Mama Roux's Retribution" and "Honor Among Swamp Rats ."

**Objective Reward:**
*   For helping Mama Roux raid Crankshaft's establishments: **SC Varies,  300 Purified Water Units**
*   For returning to the King of the Castaways after saving Ticker Tim : **SC Varies, The Bayou Diplomat, Scavenger's Reinforced Leathers**

Return to Gator  Gus's Humidor. Tell him about Crankshaft's Beetriot connection. Gus, impressed, instructs you to find  **Rex "Six-Gun" Nebula**, a grizzled, semi-retired ex-Beetriot Enforcer now running  a low-key "security consultancy" out of a converted house-boat. Rex might know how to leverage this information or  get you an audience with the powers that be in Beetriot, or at least someone who can put serious pressure on Crankshaft ’s benefactor and thus on Crankshaft himself, forcing him to release Buck "Banjo" Beaumont. Since you may  have heard of Rex before, you just need to find his houseboat, "The Rusty Pelican," moored near the old cann ery. Turns out, Rex was just about to meet a "concerned citizen" from the fringes of Beetriot society and  invites you along to a rendezvous near the old causeway connecting Lickskillet to the mainland.

**Objective Reward:** 
*   For telling Gus about Crankshaft's Beetriot connection: **150 SC**

 This reimagining attempts to keep the quest structure while deeply infusing it with Primal Mama's specific lore, aesthetics , and character archetypes from your coherence document. The rewards, enemy types, locations, and motivations are all shifted to fit the bay ou-infused, retro-futuristic, strangely spiritual miasma.
