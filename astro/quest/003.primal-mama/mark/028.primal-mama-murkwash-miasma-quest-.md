## Introduction: Defining Dynamic Potential Through Authentication

*This protocol guides the definition of the **functional  properties** of entities within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel, these properties define an entity's potential  for action, interaction, and influence within the world's established rules (modalities). They encompass **capabilities (abilities , skills, powers)** as well as crucial **limitations (weaknesses, costs, constraints, inabilities)**.*

*Focus  on **authenticating** these functions clearly and consistently. Define not just *what* an entity can do, but * how*, under *what conditions*, at *what cost*, and crucially, *what it cannot do*. These properties are essential for  narrative mechanics, conflict generation, character agency, and world coherence.*

### Authenticated Functional Properties Bundle :

**1. Core Function / Purpose:**
   *Purpose: Define the primary intended or actualized function within  the world system.*
    *   `- Primary Role: Player investigates the disruption of GE Alligator behavior in the MurkW ash Delta at the behest of Mama Manchet, a local Swamp Witch, who needs a pristine Solar-Charged Gator Gizzard for  a potent ritual. The quest explores the interaction of advanced GE, retro-tech, and supernatural elements.` # Auth: Codex  PrimalMama v0.1 (Swamp Witches, GE Alligators, 1970s Aesthetic , Solar Dominance)
    *   `- Secondary Role(s): Introduces the player to the unique ecology and  hazards of the MurkWash Delta. Potentially uncovers a relic of forgotten technology or evidence of covert oligarchy activity.  Offers choices affecting local swamp denizens and potentially Mama Manchet's standing.` # Auth: Codex PrimalMama v 0.1 (Technological Aesthetic Constraint, Meat Processor Oligarchy friction)

**2. Key Capabilities & Powers (Authenticated  Strengths of the Quest Structure):**
   *Purpose: Define what the quest *enables* the player to actively  do or experience.*
    *   `- Capability ID: FUNC-QMMM-01`
        *    *Name:* `Investigation & Clue Discovery`
        *   *Description:* `Player utilizes their senses (and  potentially basic 1970s-style scanning equipment provided or found) to uncover clues about the gators' distress:  unusual energy readings, physical symptoms on gators (e.g., malfunctioning solar chromatophores, erratic behavior), environmental anomalies  (e.g., strange hum, localized energy fields, odd plant growth).`
        *   *Authentication:* `World 's allowance for investigation; 1970s tech aesthetic implies analog readouts/scanners.`
        *    *Limits/Nuances:* `Clues may be subtle or require specific conditions (e.g., time of day for  energy readings, specific gator behaviors). Scanners might be unreliable or have limited range/functionality due to the 1 970s aesthetic constraint.`
    *   `- Capability ID: FUNC-QMMM-02`
        *    *Name:* `NPC Interaction & Information Gathering`
        *   *Description:* `Player interacts with Mama Manchet  (quest giver), potentially other swamp dwellers (e.g., reclusive trappers, other minor witches), or even Er penthropes if they are drawn to the "truth" of the disturbance. Dialogue choices can yield more or less information, or  alter NPC disposition.`
        *   *Authentication:* `Authenticated existence of Swamp Witches, Erpenthropes , and general populace.`
        *   *Limits/Nuances:* `NPCs may be distrustful, cryptic , or have their own agendas. Swamp Witch lore might be esoteric and hard to decipher. Erpenthropes might only  reveal certain truths.`
    *   `- Capability ID: FUNC-QMMM-03`
        *   *Name :* `Problem Solving (Technological/Supernatural Interface)`
        *   *Description:* `Player must identify the source of  the gator disruption – an old, malfunctioning "Aetheric Wave Modulator" (conforming to 1970s  aesthetic: wood paneling, chunky dials, Nixie tube displays) – and determine how to neutralize or repair it. This might  involve understanding its retro-tech interface or using ritualistic means to counter its esoteric energy leakage if it's become " haunted" or strangely energized.`
        *   *Authentication:* `Technological Aesthetic Constraint, Spectral Interaction possibility, Solar  Dominance (implying advanced energy tech that could go wrong).`
        *   *Limits/Nuances :* `Repairing the Modulator might require rare 1970s-era components or specific technical knowledge. Ritual istic neutralization might require ingredients gathered from the swamp or knowledge from Mama Manchet/ghosts.`
    *   `- Capability  ID: FUNC-QMMM-04`
        *   *Name:* `Combat & Hazard Navigation`
        *    *Description:* `Player may face glitched/aggressive GE Alligators, other mutated swamp creatures affected by the Mod ulator's miasma, or even automated defenses if the Modulator is an oligarchy experiment. The MurkWash Delta  itself presents environmental hazards (e.g., toxic zones from the miasma, treacherous terrain).`
        *   *Authentication :* `GE Alligators' capabilities, potential for unknown biological effects from the calamity/rogue tech.`
        *   *Limits /Nuances:* `Glitched gators might have unpredictable attack patterns or resistances. The miasma might require protective  gear (improvised 1970s style) or have debilitating effects.`
    *   `- Capability ID: FUNC- QMMM-05`
        *   *Name:* `Ethical/Factional Choice Point`
        *    *Description:* `Player decides what to do with the Modulator once found: Destroy it? Repair it for Mama  Manchet (if she has a use for its controlled output)? Report its existence to the Erpenthropes (truth -seekers) or a rival Meat Oligarchy faction? Each choice has consequences.`
        *   *Authentication:* ` Authenticated values of Erpenthropes (truth), potential for oligarchy machinations.`
        *   *Limits /Nuances:* `Destroying it might anger someone. Repairing it could be dangerous. Reporting it could trigger wider conflict.`
