## Bayou Salvage Run: West Lickskillet & Muddy Crossroads

**Objective:** Recover Schematic: Bio -Resonant Dampener

**Location:** Dilapidated Processing Outpost, West of Lickskillet

** Procedure:**
Launch your airboat from the **"Lickskillet South Gate"** dock marker. Navigate the murky channel  westward, avoiding submerged wrecks and aggressive snapper turtles. Veer north at the three-headed cypress stump. Look for a  collapsed corrugated metal structure overgrown with Kudzu near the water's edge. Climb the rusted exterior ladder (check for stability  first – tetanus is no joke). Inside, navigate the debris-filled upper floor. Search a rusted footlocker near the southern  wall, tucked behind a non-functional, wood-paneled processor unit. Inside, you should find the **Sche matic: Bio-Resonant Dampener**. This device is rumored to help disrupt the sensory organs of certain aggressive swamp fauna , maybe even useful against rogue Erpenthropes if you believe the whispers.

**World Note (Gear Progression ):**
*   "Witcher Gear" is replaced by locally crafted or salvaged gear, often based on durable  Gator Hide and repurposed Pre-Calamity components. High-tier schematics often require components salvaged *from* lower-tier crafted  items (e.g., needing the reinforced plating from a standard Gator-Hide Vest to build an Enhanced version). Ho arding functional, older custom gear is common practice among savvy swamp runners – breaking down unique mods or well-tuned parts is wasteful . Weight is managed by airboat storage or stash boxes at trusted settlements. If you can fabricate the Dampener or the  Enhanced Gator-Hide Drag Suit (see below) and it improves your loadout against local threats, consider visiting a L ickskillet tech-scavenger or crafting bench.

**Journey South: The Missing Hatchling**

** Procedure:**
Time for a potentially long, definitely humid airboat trek. From the processing outpost, head back towards the main channel  and navigate south-east, following the sluggish current past the **"Old Fish Camp"** marker. The bayou wid ens here. Follow the shoreline marked by leaning, moss-draped pylons. Eventually, you'll spot a small, isolated  stilt-house dock east of the main waterway – the **"Hermit's Perch"** marker isn 't official but most locals know it. A jittery Swamp Hermit flags you down, muttering about his prize  "Solar Gator Hatchling" being snatched by "some kinda Swamp Snatcher." Agree to help him to initiate the task  **"Snatcher's Snack."**

---

### Task: Snatcher's Snack (Difficulty: Moderate )

**Procedure:**
Activate your **Bio-Scanner** (standard issue, looks like a bulky 70s  tricorder). Look for faint energy signatures and disturbed muck near the Hermit's dock – the Solar Gators leave a unique  bio-electric trace. Follow the readings south-east into a denser mangrove thicket. The trail will lead across a shallow, algae -choked pond (watch for leeches). On the far side, pick up the trail again, heading further south-east.  You'll eventually stumble upon a hidden camp – likely territorial **Swamp Recluses** (not officially Scoia'tael , but similarly distrustful and potentially hostile).

The Recluse who approaches warns you off. Your options:
1 .  **Intimidate:** Leverage your reputation or swamp knowledge (requires appropriate character build/dialogue choices). May  fail if they're desperate or well-armed.
2.  **Pay:** Offer 100 ** Gator Scrip** (local currency). They might accept if they just wanted supplies.
3.  **Fight :** Draw your weapon (shotgun, modified machete, etc.). Expect a tough fight in close quarters.
4 .  **Strategic Retreat (Fail):** Leave them the hatchling. The Hermit won't be pleased. 

Once you secure the hatchling (it's small, probably scared, emits a faint warmth), carefully transport it back to  the Hermit's enclosure near his stilt-house. Secure the pen, then talk to the Hermit for  your reward.

**Rewards:**
*   **For Intimidation/Clever Talking:** 40 Trust  Points (Local Standing)
*   **For Wiping Out the Recluses:** Salvageable Gear (V aries), Negative Trust Points
*   **For Finding the Hatchling:** Trust Points (Varies)
*   ** For Returning the Hatchling:** Trust Points (Varies)
*   **Reward:** 20 Gator Scrip,  maybe some quality Gator Jerky.

**World Note:** *Approaching the Recluse camp too aggressively (e.g.,  airboat engine roaring right up to them) may cause them to open fire without parley.*

**Continuing  South: Scavver Camp & Distress Call**

**Procedure:**
Continue south-east via airboat along the main channel until  you find the **"Muddy Crossroads"** marker signpost (nailed crookedly to a massive cypress knee). We  technically overshot slightly for the next objective, but finding markers is good practice. From the Crossroads, head south-east into  a smaller tributary choked with water hyacinths. You'll find a **Scavenger Camp**. These aren't necessarily  hostile Recluses, just opportunists. Deal with them (likely violently). Loot their haul – check near the jury -rigged generator (likely salvaged solar panels) and inside their beached, half-stripped airboat hull.

**Objective :** Person(s) in Distress (Difficulty: Moderate)

**Procedure:**
Backtrack north-west via airboat to the  **"Muddy Crossroads"** marker. Take the eastern fork this time. Follow it as it bends north-east.  When it splits again, take the south-eastern channel. Keep an eye out for signs of trouble – maybe blaster scor ch marks on trees, discarded gear. You'll find a **"Person(s) in Distress"** situation:  Several armed thugs (likely low-level Oligarchy enforcers or rival scavengers) guarding a cage.

Take  out the thugs (expect shotguns and maybe some crude stun batons). Loot the leader for a **"Magnetic Lock  Keycard"** (chunky, 70s plastic). Use it on the cage controls to free a ** Swamp Trader** (specializing in rare herbs or maybe black market pre-Calamity tech). He'll thank  you profusely and head back to his hidden stash point further south. Loot the thugs' supplies and check a nearby crate for  **"Water-Logged Notes"** hinting at Oligarchy price-fixing tactics in Lickskillet.

**Reward :**
*   **For Freeing the Trader:** 150 Trust Points (Local Standing), Potential future discounts .

**North to the Ruins: The Bio-Lab**

**Objective:** Recover Schematic: Enhanced Gator-Hide Drag  Suit

**Location:** Derelict Bio-Research Outpost ("Aurelian Labs" - faded sign)

** Procedure:**
Head back north to the last fork and take the north-eastern channel this time. When it forks * again*, continue north-east. At the *third* fork, finally head south-east. You should eventually spot the **" Aurelian Labs Access Point"** marker partially submerged near a crumbling concrete dock. Continue south-east towards the overgrown, multi -building ruin. Approaching the main lab structure (identifiable by satellite dish remnants on the roof) triggers the side  quest **"Bio-Genesis Blues."** Ignore that prompt for a moment.

Climb the exterior emergency stairs (or  find a collapsed section to scramble up). Reach what was likely the primary research floor – now exposed to the elements, littered  with rusted equipment consoles featuring chunky buttons and analog dials. Search near a knocked-over metal bookshelf on the north side to  find a sealed container holding the **Schematic: Enhanced Gator-Hide Drag Suit**.

---

### Quest: Bio -Genesis Blues (Difficulty: Moderate-High)

**Procedure:**
*(This quest automatically starts if you didn't previously  find related logs mentioning Aurelian Labs.)* You should already have the **"Security Access Dongle"** and the ** "Bio-Sample Container (Beta)"** from previous related salvage runs (replacing the figurines). Use your Bio-Scanner near  the main console bank; it should detect a faint energy signature from an auxiliary power input. Activate it (requires interacting with a  specific, less-damaged console). If you have the required items, a flickering energy field nearby stabilizes into a shimmering ** Spatial Distortion** (portal equivalent). Step through.

**The Spore Vents:**
You're inside a  sealed section of the lab. The air is thick with luminescent spores – signs indicate high toxicity. The researcher here, notes  suggest, was obsessed with bizarre bio-genesis, possibly trying to re-engineer digestive flora or something equally unsettling. V ents periodically release dense clouds of these spores. Your goal is to reach the far side (south-east). Time your movements between  vent cycles, or use a limited-charge Rebreather if you have one. Stick to the slightly elevated, less contaminated  grating where possible. Reach the ledge on the south-east side and proceed through the flickering bulkhead door.

**Reward :**
*   **For Navigating the Spore Vents:** Experience Points / Skill Usage (Varies)

** The Flooded Bio-Tanks:**
Go through the bulkhead and down a ramp into a flooded chamber – likely old specimen  tanks. The water is murky. Swim north, then east to reach a larger chamber with ledges just out of reach ( a chest might be submerged here, optional). Instead, swim north from the entry ramp and dive briefly to find an access  tunnel. Surface in a maintenance section. Climb some ledges, proceed south-east, then east to another climbable ledge. Jump  a gap (or take the safer lower path north-east, then south) to reach the main laboratory area.

** Reward:**
*   **For Clearing the Flooded Section:** Experience Points / Skill Usage (Varies)

** The Laboratory & The Static Slapper:**
A **Miasma Lurker** (a flickering, bio-lum inescent predator drawn to energy sources) guards this lab. Dispatch it carefully (Bio-Resonant Dampener might help, if built ). Search the lab:
*   South-west table: Find another **"Security Access Dongle (Delta)"** and ** "Aurelian's Log Tape"** (a chunky cassette).
*   Use your **Sonic Scanner** ( replaces Eye of Nehaleni) on the western rock wall – it reveals structural weakness. Use an **Overload Charge** or  heavy melee to break through. Loot containers inside.
*   North of the weak wall is another chamber with a console;  activate it to open the way forward.

**The Test Chamber:**
To the south-west is a large chamber  blocked by an angry red energy barrier – likely a containment field for weapons testing.
*   Use the Sonic Scanner again : Find resonant frequencies on two **Energy Pylons**, one south (hidden behind loose panels, needs Sonic Scanner to pinpoint ) and one north (exposed).
*   Hit both pylons with **Igni** equivalent (maybe a focused  burst from a cutting torch, or an electrical discharge weapon). This destabilizes the containment field.
*   Head up  the stairs inside. Grab the **"Bio-Sample Container (Gamma)"** from a reinforced chest. Take the unique  device from the pedestal near the defunct test dummy... Geralt might wryly call it **"The Static Slapper" ** (a heavy gauntlet crackling with bio-static electricity).

**Reward:**
*   **For Claim ing The Static Slapper:** Unique Weapon Acquired (Experience Varies)

Head up the stairs near the pedestal ( south-west) to find the final **Spatial Distortion**, leading you back outside the ruins.

**Final  Objective: Guarded Salvage**

**Procedure:**
One last piece of high-value salvage nearby. Head south-west from  the **"Aurelian Labs Access Point"** marker into the dense, darker swamp. Watch out for packs of aggressive,  mutated **Swamp Hounds** (replace Wolves/Wargs). You'll eventually detect a strong energy signature or  unusual fungal growth marking a **"Guarded Salvage"** site. A massive **Fungal Guardian** (replace  Leshen - slow, tough, maybe releases spore clouds or commands lesser fungal creatures) protects a high-ground cache. 

**Engagement:** Defeat the Fungal Guardian (aim for core nodes or use fire/chemical agents if effective) and any ** Fungal Crawlers** (replace Wolves) it spawns. Loot the reinforced chest it was guarding. Inside: the  unique shotgun **"Swamp Cleanser"** (high pellet spread, maybe bonus damage to bio-targets). If  you handled this encounter, you're likely ready for tougher challenges deeper in the bayous, perhaps near the Oligarchy's main  processing hubs.
