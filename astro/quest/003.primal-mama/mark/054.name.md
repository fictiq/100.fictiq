Okay, this is a fun challenge! Let's re-imagine that Witcher 3 tutorial  opening within the world of Primal Mama, using the "Coherence & Internal Logic Protocol" as our guide.

Here 's the recontextualized quest:

## Primal Mama Quest: Bayou Morning Blues

**Location :** Gator Jacques's Stilt-Shack, outskirts of Lickskillet
**Characters:** Gator Jacques ( an Erpenthrope), Mama Delphine (a local Swamp Witch), Li'l Fang (a feisty swamp  kid Jacques is mentoring), Old Man Rèche (an elder Erpenthrope or seasoned swamp guide).

---

 The game begins with a murky, humid ambiance. The **chunky, solar-powered swamp cooler** in Gator Jacques’ s stilt-shack whirs rhythmically, fighting a losing battle against the bayou heat. Gator Jacques, our  Erpenthrope protagonist, is soaking in a reclaimed, rust-stained porcelain tub, its once-gleaming fixtures  now dull. The water is lukewarm, heated by a rooftop solar panel array that looks like it was salvaged from a  1970s space program.

Suddenly, a blur of fur and teeth! One of Mama Delphine’s  infamous **vampire bunnies**, small and unnervingly fast, leaps from a shadowy corner and nips at Jacques ’s exposed big toe before skittering away.

"Dammit, Delphine!" Jacques growls, splashing  water. "Keep your fuzzy little bloodsuckers on a leash!"

Mama Delphine, lounging on a worn N augahyde recliner and idly stirring her chicory coffee with a gator tooth, just smirks. Her  shack is adorned with Cthulhu-esque carvings intertwined with local flora, and a faintly glowing Burt Reynolds prayer candle flick ers on a side table made from an old speaker cabinet. "Now, now, Jacques. Just keeping you alert. Besides , you said you needed to talk to Li'l Fang about her 'gator-wrangling practice'. Seemed  like she was more interested in practicing her knife throws on Old Man Rèche’s fishing nets."

The two exchange  some gruff, bayou-laced banter about the responsibilities of mentoring the youth in these strange times. Jacques , grumbling, decides it's time to get dressed (faded denim, a gator-tooth necklace, and well -worn boots). A day in the life of a Lickskillet Erpenthrope begins.

Or rather , the game's tutorial begins. Your first task is to find the key to the main shack door. Jacques, ever  cautious of swamp critters and the occasional over-curious Lickskillet denizen, always locks it. You could  stumble around, pointlessly flicking the **chunky bakelite switches** of the flickering fluorescent lights or examining the collection  of antique fishing lures and strange, sun-bleached bones that pass for decor. Gator Jacques and Mama Delphine might  offer some dry commentary.

In the north-western corner of the room (relative to your mini-map – a surprisingly  functional piece of salvaged 1970s tech with a flickering CRT display), atop a stack of water-stained  "Swamp Monsters Monthly" magazines on a particle-board table, you'll spot the glint of metal. Of  course, you're supposed to be trying out your unique Erpenthrope ability: **"Gator Sense" [ L2]**. Hold that button down. The world takes on a slightly distorted, heat-hazy shimmer. Important  objects, like that wayward key, will pulse with a faint, greenish bio-luminescence, perhaps even showing faint spectral  traces of recent interaction (thanks to that permeable veil between worlds). Grab the key.

Yes, the game even gives you a tutorial  for unlocking doors. Turns out you have to face the solid, wood-paneled door and press [X]. Who  knew survival in the swamp was so complex?

*Note: All directions will be given in relation to the mini-map.  It's a pretty nifty, solar-charged tool that'll make navigating the murky byways of Lickskillet  easier.*

Unlock the door and swagger out onto the rickety walkway connecting to the main platform of Jacques’s stilt- dwelling, Gator Jacques-style. Once outside, breathing in the thick, humid air tinged with the smell of alligator processing  and swamp gas, Jacques will notice that Old Man Rèche—who was supposed to be supervising Li'l Fang’s less  dangerous chores—has failed. Miserably. Instead of mending nets or cleaning solar panels, Li'l Fang is  out on the main Lickskillet boardwalk, enthusiastically practicing her machete swings on some makeshift **training dummies fashioned  from bundled reeds and discarded gator hides**. Old Man Rèche is snoozing soundly in a patched-up lawn  chair under the shade of a tattered tarpaulin, a half-eaten bowl of gator stew beside him. 

After some sharp words are exchanged with a now-grumbling Rèche (who blames the "soporific effects  of the midday sun"), Gator Jacques heads over to have a word with the young, aspiring swamp survivalist. After chatting with Li 'l Fang for a bit, and perhaps confiscating a dangerously sharp piece of scrap metal, she'll grin mischiev ously. "Betcha can't keep up, old timer! Wanna **run the gantries**?" This challenge  initiates a handy, more in-depth tutorial covering basic mobility, navigating the precarious walkways, half-submerged platforms, and  rusted metal structures of the Lickskillet processing outskirts.
