Okay, let's re-imagine that Witcher 3 quest  sequence within the strange, bayou-infused, retro-futuristic world of Primal Mama, using the Codex as our guide.

# Primal Mama: Bayou Whispers & Gator Guts

**World:** Primal Mama
** Scenario Log:** 0.1 - Lickskillet Hustle
**Based on:** Witcher 3 Quest Path  Analysis (Velen Start)

---

## Bayou Sector - The Mirelands

*(The Runner navigates the murky waterways , following fragmented leads concerning strange disappearances and whispers of the "Invisible Women" conspiracy.)*

**Resonant Node ( Neural Attunement)**
*Requires: Basic Skiff/Watercraft*

Maneuver your skiff around  the crumbling pylons of a pre-Calamity structure half-submerged along the north-western edge of the  main 'gator farm archipelago. Along the eastern bank of this small, overgrown island of concrete and rusted metal, you should  detect faint energy readings with your handheld scanner. This indicates a **Resonant Node**, likely an old solar relay or bio -feedback conduit still pulsing with residual energy. Interface with it carefully (risk of bio-feedback shock) to gain a ** Neural Attunement Point** (improves innate abilities or allows interface with more complex retro-tech). Note the derel ict Solar Tower looming on the cliffs above, its access ramp long retracted. Access seems impossible from here. Ironically, the way  up involves going *down*.

**Submerged Access (Requires Hazard Suit / Good Lungs)**
*Recommended Gear : Basic Hazard Suit, Harpoon Gun/Electro-Prod*

Dive off the south-eastern edge of the Node  island. Murky water conceals a maintenance tunnel leading under the structure. **Feral Bio-Filters** (Level  10 - mutated organisms or malfunctioning drones designed to clean water, now aggressive) pollute the tunnel. Use your harpoon gun  to thin their numbers if needed, or try to navigate past their grasping pseudopods. Eventually, you'll find rusted  rungs leading up a maintenance shaft. Surface and climb. Your reward for the hazardous swim is a waterlogged footlocker containing surprisingly  well-preserved **Salvaged Components** (Superior Quality) just east of the waterlogged entry point. Nearby, scale  some crumbling ferrocrete ledges twice, then climb a maintenance ladder to reach the **Rustwater Spire** level.

**Rust water Spire (Requires Caution)**
*Potential Threats: Structural Instability, Territorial Skyscale*

Ascend a  set of grated stairs, scavenging a small **parts chest** and a discarded **data chit** (minor lore/flavor ). Continue up another flight, looting two more **storage chests** and three **supply parcels** (good haul of basic crafting  materials and stim-packs). Head through a doorway framed in faded orange plastic to the south-west, then turn south- east and find a manual **winch mechanism** (classic 70s chunky lever). Crank it to lower the rusted  access ramp, connecting the spire back to a precarious cliff path. Cross the ramp to activate the **"Rustwater Spire" Way finder Post** on your map device. Good time to log your progress (save game).

Return to the Spire  interior near the doorway you emerged from. Spot a rickety service ladder leading to an upper platform housing the main solar collector  array (or what's left of it). Up here are two more **chests**, a functional **grind stone** (weapon maintenance), and other containers. We're primarily interested in the **maintenance locker** next to the grind stone, along the south-eastern wall.

**Problem:** The upper platform is the nesting ground of a **Territorial Sk yscale** (Level 14 - Large, aggressive mutated avian/reptile, possibly escaped from a failed bio-project ). It will make short work of an unprepared Runner. Your best bet is a quick smash-and-grab: sprint up the  ladder, force the locker (requires decent Mechanics skill or a prybar), grab the contents (**Old Schematics**, ** Schematic: Electro-Prod Mk II** - potent anti-bio weapon), and scramble back down (or drop,  taking impact damage). If successful, you'll have the plans for a powerful Level 7 Electro-Prod, invaluable  against GE Gators and other bio-threats.

*Optional Risk:* If feeling bold (or foolish), you can try  looting the adjacent radio booth – containers on the first and third levels hold minor loot. Near the third-floor chest is  a damaged data slate: **"Log Entry: Maintenance Tech Dobromir"** (lore snippet). Reaching the roof platform , however, *will* provoke the Skyscale. Once you have the schematic (or decide it's not worth the risk),  head back down and use the Wayfinder Post to travel to **"The Gator Hook"** landmark.

*Note:* Story  Progression may alter this location. After certain regional events related to the Meat Oligarchy's expansion, the Skyscale might be driven  off or captured, replaced by Oligarchy "surveyors" or scavengers picking through the ruins.

**Shrieker  Feeding Ground (Optional Hazard Zone)**
*Requires: Decent Firearm/Anti-Air Capability*

From the Rust water Spire ramp exit, follow the crumbling service road south-east, then south until it intersects a muddy track running north -east. You'll find the **"Shrieker Feeding Ground" Wayfinder Post**. Aptly named, the  area is infested with **Shrieker Flocks** (Level 7 - Aggressive mutated bird swarms). A  half-buried **supply crate** lies nearby, lootable if you can suppress the airborne pests long enough. This detour  yields minor resources but isn't critical for the main objective.

*Next Steps & Preparation:* The next phase likely  involves confronting more organized threats or powerful individual entities (like a rogue Erpenthrope or Oligarchy enforcers). You  probably shouldn't proceed until you're better equipped (Level 7+, ideally with the crafted Electro-Prod Mk  II). Options:
1.  **Grind:** Hunt lesser swamp creatures or take on minor contracts. East of ** Mudlark Crossing** (south of The Gator Hook) lies **"The Slag Pit,"** a polluted industrial  zone. North of its Wayfinder Post is a **Swamp Rat Camp** (Level 6-7 Scavengers). South  is a marshy field where **Feral Gator Pups** (Level 6) frequently spawn. Harvesting gator parts  is always useful.
2.  **Continue Primary Quest:** Focus on the "Whispers in the Miasma" leads , which might offer better rewards and safer progression initially.

---

## Whispers in the Miasma: Following  Hendrik's Trail

**Mudlark Crossing**
*Requires: Basic Interaction Skills*

Enough risky side-tracking . Time to follow the lead on the missing contact, Hendrik. From **"The Gator Hook,"** head south along  the main swamp trail until you reach the small, stilt-house settlement of **Mudlark Crossing**. Not much here  besides wary locals and buzzing insects. Check the **Community Notice Board** (a rusted metal sheet). Grab any posted jobs . One notice, scrawled on synth-parchment – **"Missing Husband - Reward Offered"** –  starts the side quest **"Swamp Heart."**

**Corpse Disposal Detail (Requires Tolerance for Grim Work)**
*Suggested  Level: 3*

As you leave Mudlark Crossing via the south-west track, you'll find a  stern-faced **Parsons Penitent** deacon (follower of the deified Gram Parsons cult) flanked by two local  toughs armed with shotguns. He flags you down. Talk to the deacon (marginally less abrasive than his guards). He offers  a task: dispose of contaminated carcasses improperly dumped nearby, preventing the spread of disease and attracting **Scavenger Packs**. He  promises payment and provides several canisters of **Bio-Neutralizing Agent**. Ciri... wait, wrong world. Your * main objective* can wait. Agree to help.

Find the first disposal site north, across a murky field marked by warning  signs. You'll interrupt a **Scavenger Pack** (Level 2 & 4 - Mix of Mire  Ghouls and Rat Hounds) feasting. Clear them out, douse the remains with the agent, and ignite it  with a flare or lighter (basic Igni equivalent).

*Objective Reward:*
*   For neutralizing the first carcass  pile: **10 Rep Points (Local)**

Backtrack south past the deacon's starting position, then head  south-west to find the second site at the end of a muddy path. A bloated **Corpse Crawler** (Rot fiend equivalent, explodes on death) and some **Feral Hounds** (Level 3) lurk nearby . Eliminate them, apply the agent, and burn the pile.

*Objective Reward:*
*   For neutralizing the second carcass pile : **10 Rep Points (Local)**

Two down. Head south-east from the second site to find the third, north  of the main southern waterway trail, a good distance from Mudlark Crossing. Here, you find a panicked man named **Titus **, fending off more **Mire Ghouls** (Level 2 & 4). Save him. Titus  reveals the deacon lied – he's involved in the local **"Swamp Shimmer"** trade (local narcotic ), and the bodies belong to rivals or witnesses. Titus was meant to be among them. Finish neutralizing the third pile,  then head back north to confront the deacon.

*Objective Reward:*
*   For neutralizing the third carcass pile:  **10 Rep Points (Local)**
*   For discovering the deacon's true motives: **25 Rep Points (Local )**

The deacon has relocated to a makeshift shelter near the northern coast, between the **Oligarchy Checkpoint** and the  ruins of **Hindhold**. Find him and his goons. Confront him about the job and the Swamp Shimmer connection . He'll offer a bribe (Standard Local Currency - "Creds") for your silence.
*   ** Refuse:** You'll fight the deacon and his two goons (Level 4-5). They're over confident but easily dispatched. Loot the deacon for **200 Creds**. Adheres to a stricter moral code,  perhaps valued by Erpenthropes.
*   **Accept:** Take the money, avoid the fight. A  pragmatic choice, perhaps fitting for a struggling Runner.

*Objective Reward:*
*   For taking the bribe: **50 Rep  Points (Local), 60 Creds**
*   For turning down the bribe: **50 Rep Points (Local)** 

**Deserter Dilemma (Requires Basic Combat)**
*Suggested Level: 4*

Return to Mud lark Crossing and try the south-west road again. Follow it until it meets a coastal track running north-south.  Near this junction, you'll hear cries for help from the south-west, near the shore. Investigate to  find a man named **John Verdun**, tied to a post, being harassed by two **Mire Ghouls** (Level  4). Kill the ghouls. John explains he's a deserter from a local militia; when refugees  discovered this, they tied him up as bait. Letting him die seems harsh. Untie him. He's grateful but penn iless.

*Objective Reward:*
*   For rescuing John Verdun: **25 Rep Points (Local)**

 **The Soggy Bottom Bar**
*Requires: Social Skills, Optional: Bayou Blitz Deck*

Follow the nearby track  north-west until another three-way fork, then take the south-west road. Cross a shallow ford (potentially guarded  by Feral Gators) and continue until you find the **"Soggy Bottom Bar" Wayfinder Post**. Check  the Notice Board for jobs. One notice – **"Missing: Mikkel"** – starts the quest **"Contract: Bayou  Brother,"** a high-level contract (Suggested Level 33) involving a powerful swamp entity. Log it for much  later.

Head inside the neon-lit, grime-covered bar. Talk to some locals near the barkeep to learn  about the regional strongman, **"Boss Croker,"** who runs things from his fortified compound, **"Cro ker's Roost."** You can also find **Bruno**, Mikkel's brother, but the contract is  too dangerous now.

Talk to the Barkeep (gruff, wary) and ask about **Hendrik**. He 's evasive. Order a murky local drink. The other patrons nervously shuffle away. The Barkeep senses trouble and  offers to talk out back. Before you can move, three **Oligarchy Enforcers** (Level 4 -  Heavily armed, wearing slightly cleaner 70s-style tactical gear) swagger in. They hassle you.

* Timed Dialogue Choices:*
1.  **Aggressive Response:** Leads to a fight.
2.  **Cautious/ Professional Response:** They size you up, decide tangling with a capable Runner isn't worth it, and leave after  some insults about freelancers/swamp rats.
3.  **Offer Drinks/Diplomacy:** Offer to buy a  round. Follow up carefully: claim you're heading to Beetriot, ask about Boss Croker, end with a neutral  "Good luck out there" to avoid conflict.

*Outcome:*
*   **Fight:** Dispatch the three Enforc ers. If you linger, more **Backup Enforcers** (Level 5) might arrive, alerted by the Bark eep (who values his bar over you). Looting them yields decent ammo and minor Creds.
*   **Peaceful :** You can talk freely with the Barkeep around a corner.

Either way, learn that Hendrik was last seen heading  towards **Hushwater Hamlet**, a settlement the Barkeep mentions seeing shrouded in a "strange cold mist" recently.

*If  Peaceful:* Talk to the Barkeep again. Ask more about Boss Croker to learn he's based at Croker's  Roost, a converted processing plant. The name "Croker" apparently came from a non-threatening incident involving a prize -winning gator, despite his current ruthless reputation.

Peruse the Barkeep's wares: He sells basic  supplies and a few **Bayou Blitz** Gwent cards (local swamp-themed variant):
*   **GE  Gator Handler** (6 Strength, Ranged) - 20 Creds
*   **Swamp Witch Initiate ** (3 Strength, Melee, Tight Bond) - 20 Creds
*   **Mud Skipper Pilot ** (2 Strength, Ranged, Tight Bond) - 20 Creds
*   **Burt Reynolds Deity  Card** (Leader: Grants Morale Boost) - 50 Creds

Play him at Bayou Blitz. His  deck is mediocre (focuses on weak swamp creatures), but watch out for his "Gator Stampede" card (clears strongest  row if total > 10) and "Solar Flare" (Scorch equivalent). Defeating him earns the **Jerry  Reed Deity Card** (Hero, Melee 10 Strength, Medic ability) – a very strong card for aggressive  decks.

*Objective Reward:*
*   For defeating the Barkeep at Bayou Blitz: **25 Rep Points ( Local), Jerry Reed Card**

**Swamp Rat Camp (Optional Cleanup)**
*Suggested Level: 7*

Before heading  to Hushwater, detour north-west from the Soggy Bottom Bar to find a **Swamp Rat Camp** hidden  in the mangroves. Clear out the **Scavengers** (Level 7) and loot their stash (ammo, parts , maybe some Swamp Shimmer).

**A Mutant's Misery (Optional Encounter)**
*Requires: Minimal  Combat*

Head west from the bar to reach the coast, then follow it north. You'll find a large , lumbering **Groggy Mutant** (Level 2 - Troll equivalent, possibly a failed bio-experiment or  heavily mutated local) being harassed by **Scavenger Packs** (Level 2 Nekker equivalent). Kill the pests . The Mutant grunts thanks in broken Basic. After ensuring it's not hostile to humans (just confused), let  it be. It might shove a handful of **Questionable Fungi** (minor alchemy ingredient, possibly toxic) into your  hands as thanks.

*Objective Reward:*
*   For helping the Groggy Mutant: **25 Rep  Points (Local)**

**Hushwater Hamlet**
*Requires: Investigation Skills, Basic Combat*

Now,  the long trek. From the Soggy Bottom Bar, head west along the main track, ignoring a northern fork leading to another  Swamp Rat camp. Cross marshy ground. When the track forks near locals gathered at a dilapidated shrine (possibly to one  of the celebrity deities), take the north-west path. At the next fork, take the south-western branch towards  **Hushwater Hamlet**. You might encounter more **Swamp Rats** (Level 5 & 6) looting  a disabled transport skiff on the road. Deal with them.

*Objective Reward:*
*   For killing the  Swamp Rats: **10 Rep Points (Local)**

Pass an outlying stilt hut (minor loot inside). Approach  Hushwater Hamlet. You'll notice the unnatural **cold mist** clinging to the ground and buildings, frost covering surfaces  despite the bayou heat – a very bad sign, possibly supernatural or related to rogue tech. Explore the silent houses along  the southern edge; they seem recently abandoned, not looted.

Go north to find a lone **Survivor** huddled and  terrified, beset by **Feral Hounds** (Level 2). Kill the hounds. Use a calming technique ( Persuasion check, or maybe a low-power sonic emitter – Axii equivalent) on the Survivor. Once coherent, he explains  what happened – a sudden violent event, possibly involving Hendrik, that left the village frozen and seemingly empty. A cutscene might  depict his fragmented memories.

Go to the third house on the south side – Hendrik's safehouse. Find his body inside , brutally mangled. Use your **Swamp Sense** (Witcher Senses) to scan the scene. Check  his boots to find a **magnetic keycard**. Search the next room, finding a hidden **floor hatch** under some  sacking, unlocked by the keycard. Inside the small cellar, activate a wall panel (reveals hidden compartment) and investigate  a **storage chest** to find a **ledger** (data slate). Read the entries. You learn Hendrik was tracking  two major leads: the activities of **Boss Croker** and strange occurrences linked to a suspected **Swamp Witch** near  **Malcose Mire** further south. This starts the quests **"Boss Croker's Grip"** and ** "Hunting the Mire Witch."** Before leaving, loot another chest in the cellar (Creds, supplies) and note  a faded poster on the wall – a "Missing Person" notice for Boss Croker's daughter. Likely relevant.

* Objective Reward:*
*   For finding Hendrik's information: **100 Rep Points (Local)**

** Enroute to Croker's Roost**
*Requires: Combat Readiness*

Two leads: Croker's Ro ost (south-east) or Malcose Mire (far south). Croker's Roost is closer. But  first, detours.

**Swamp Rat Camp (Level 7)**
From Hushwater, head south along the track  until a four-way intersection. A **Swamp Rat Camp** (Level 7) is set up here in  a ruined pre-Calamity gas station. Clear them out, loot the main chest near the rusted pumps. More  minor loot inside the building.

**Defender of the Faith (Requires Minor Repair Skill / Strength)**
*Suggested Level: 1 0*

Take the road south from the intersection. When it splits, head west until you find an old woman fuss ing over a vandalized roadside shrine – likely dedicated to Burt Reynolds (judging by the mustache motif). Talk to her;  she's distraught, fearing retribution from "The Bandit" (Reynolds' persona) if the shrine isn't repaired.  Agree to help. Lift the heavy concrete icon back into place (Strength check or use a prybar). The woman praises  you. She mentions other vandalized shrines further south, past Malcose Mire, asking you to fix any you see. Agree ing adds minor objectives to your log.

*Objective Reward:*
*   For repairing the shrine: **10 Rep Points ( Local)**

**Blackwillow Bend**
*Requires: Interaction Skills, Optional: Bayou Blitz Deck*

Continue  south-east towards Croker's Roost until you reach the slightly larger settlement of **Blackwillow Bend**. Rest  until daytime if needed. Find a **Traveling Merchant** (random Gwent card reward for winning) near the east entrance and a ** Mechanic/Blacksmith** (70s tech equivalent) in a workshop to the south-west (random G went card reward). Neither are tough opponents.

The Mechanic sells various **Schematics** and crucially, **"Sc avenger's Datapad: Feline Gear - Vol 2"**. These datapads lead to hidden caches of specialized  gear (analogous to Witcher School gear). Reading this starts **"Scavenger Hunt: Feline Retro-Suit  Upgrade Schematics - Part 2."** The Merchant sells **"Scavenger's Datapad: Feline Gear - Vol  1,"** starting **"Scavenger Hunt: Feline Retro-Suit"** and **"Part 1" ** of the upgrades. These likely require higher levels and travel to dangerous areas (like Beetriot outskirts?). Log them for later. 

Once business is done, find a specific house on the north-western edge. Inside is **Niellen**, the  man who posted the "Missing Husband" notice ("Swamp Heart" quest). Talk to him about his missing wife,  **Hanna**. Her sister, **Margrit**, interjects suspiciously. Agree to help. Margrit suggests asking the  Mechanic and another local, **Glenna**.

**Swamp Heart (Requires Investigation & Combat)**
*Suggested Level:  7*

Return to the Mechanic. Ask about Hanna. His kids pester you. He eventually recalls his son seeing Hanna heading  into the deep swamp near dawn, with another woman. He warns about a pack of **Feral Hounds** known  to roam that area, which only Niellen usually dares to handle. Next, talk to Glenna. She also blames the F eral Hounds.

Follow the trail north-west out of Blackwillow Bend. At a cluster of paths, take a  small track north, passing a dilapidated shack marked "Chem Supplies." Continue until another trail leads west. Follow this into a  marked search area. Activate your **Swamp Sense**. Detect disturbance near the center – encounter the **Feral Hound Pack** (Level  6).

Kill the hounds. Margrit (Hanna's sister) conveniently shows up, urging you to stop  searching and tell Niellen his wife is dead (killed by the hounds). She offers extra **Creds** for this  lie.
*   **Accept Offer:** Gain **72 Rep Points, 55 Creds**. Return to Ni ellen, tell him the lie. You can accept (**45 Rep, 10 Creds**) or decline (** 27 Rep**) his meager reward. Quest ends unsatisfactorily.
*   **Refuse Offer:** Margrit gets  angry, calls you callous. Continue investigation.
*   **Accept Offer, Keep Looking (Most Lucrative):** Take  the money, then ignore her plea and continue searching.

Use Swamp Sense near where the hounds were. Find a **dead  gator-dog** (local semi-domesticated creature). Inspect its wounds – large claws, not typical hound bites . Find **blood spatters** nearby. Head east slightly to find Hanna's corpse. Inspection confirms the wounds are from something large  and powerful – an **Erpenthrope**. Even if you took Margrit's money, the quest updates:  Find the creature responsible.

Head north-east, finding **large, clawed tracks** in the mud. Follow  them. Spot claw marks high on a cypress tree. The creature climbed. Search the base. North of the tree,  find a tuft of **distinctive reptilian fur/hide** snagged on a root. You now have its scent/ trace.

Activate Swamp Sense. A faint **bio-luminescent trail** (Erpenthrope scent signature) hangs in the  air. Follow this meandering trail deeper into the swamp. It leads north-west, eventually ending near a pile of discarded  **men's clothing** (70s style). Track footprints north-west to the **"Recluse's St ilt Shack" Wayfinder Post**.

**Recluse's Stilt Shack**
Explore the shack interior (minor  loot). One chest in the bedroom is locked. Find **"Cryptic Log Entries"** (data slate) on the  floor. Read them – it's the personal log of someone aware they are an Erpenthrope, struggling with the  transformation ("the Change") and trying remedies mentioned in old lore ("Fool's Parsley poultice," "T ears of the Uncorrupted"). Leave the shack. Search around the southern side to pick up a **blood trail**.  Follow it around to the western side, revealing a hidden **hatch leading down** into a natural cave system beneath the shack.

 *Note:* The remedies mentioned echo Witcher 1 lore about curing lycanthropy, suggesting similar folk beliefs might exist in Pr imal Mama regarding Erpenthropes, perhaps equally ineffective.

Rest until midnight (Erpenthropes often  transform nocturnally). Prepare gear (Electro-Prod, stims). Use brute force or a tool (Aard equivalent  - maybe a sonic burst device?) to break open the hatch. Descend into the tunnels. Reach a large cavern. The  **Erpenthrope** (Level 7-8) attacks, possibly aided by summoned **Swamp Critters** (minor  allies). It's fast and powerful. Use quick attacks with the Electro-Prod, dodge its lunges.

When  the Erpenthrope is heavily wounded, Margrit appears again, pleading for you to stop. If you took her money,  the Runner might dryly remark, "Changed my mind." Question Margrit. She reveals the Erpenthrope is  **Niellen**, her brother-in-law. She loved him, and Hanna found out. Margrit lured Hanna into  the swamp knowing Niellen might lose control during the Change. The wounded Niellen overhears, enraged. Margrit protests  her innocence (claiming she didn't intend for Hanna to die), but Niellen believes the worst.

*Timed Decision:*
 1.  **Tell Margrit to Run:** You finish off the suffering Niellen. A somewhat merciful, pragmatic end .
2.  **Let Niellen Kill Margrit:** Stand aside as the enraged Erpenthrope silences her. A  darker choice. Afterwards, the exhausted Niellen will likely beg you to end his cursed existence.

*Outcome:* Experience /Rep points might be similar. Sparing Margrit allows you to potentially report her actions later (if relevant). Killing Niellen  yields **Erpenthrope Tissue Samples** (rare alchemical/crafting component) and **Niellen's  Key**. Letting Niellen kill Margrit means no Erpenthrope loot, but you still get the key from her  body or Niellen afterwards.

Use Niellen's Key to open the locked chest in his shack upstairs. Contains  personal effects, some Creds, and the **Schematic: Bayou Stalker Jacket** (high-level light armor).

** Abandoned Filter Tower (Optional Loot)**
Before heading to Crow's Perch, take another detour for potential gear. From the ** "Recluse's Stilt Shack,"** head east until you hit a track, follow it east. You'll find the  **"Abandoned Filter Tower" Wayfinder Post**. The tower seems inaccessible. Look for the corner pointing towards the track –  notice uncut stonework/concrete forming rough handholds. Carefully climb this section. From the highest point, you can mantle  onto the tower's lower platform. Find two **loot chests**. Carefully climb back down.

**Monster Nest ( Bio-Hazard)**
*Suggested Level: 9*

Fast travel back to Blackwillow Bend via Wayfinder Post to  save time. Leave via the south-east road. Continue until you find a track leading south. Follow it to discover  a **Ghoul Nest** (cluster of pulsating bio-pods). Clear out the **Mire Ghouls** (Level  9) attracted to it. Plant an explosive charge or use heavy ordnance (Grendade Launcher attachment?) to destroy the  nest. Note the disturbing mix of burnt and unburnt bodies nearby – this wasn't just random nesting.

*Objective  Reward:*
*   For destroying the Monster Nest: **20 Rep Points (Local)**

Return north to the main south -east road. Continue along it towards your next major objective: **Croker's Roost**. As you approach the heavily  fortified compound, the **"Boss Croker's Grip"** quest will update. Time to find a way inside and  confront the Baron... err, the Boss.
