## Primal Mama: Lick skillet Bayou Adventures (Cont.)

### Bayou Stash (Replaces: Hidden Treasure)

First, however,  head north-east from this makeshift camp to find... another derelict shanty with a Hidden Stash! Along the way,  you might encounter more **Gator-Pups** (genetically unstable alligator runts) or packs of **F eral Hogs**. The shanty itself is likely crawling with more of them. When the mutated critters have been chased off, search  the wreckage. Seems like somebody came out for a little "communion with the spirits of Burt and Jerry" (a  common, if often ill-fated, swamp ritual), but was overwhelmed by the local bio-hazards. Loot  the water-logged sacks outside the collapsed lean-to, then turn your attention to the goodies inside. In a rusty  footlocker, you'll find a "Greasy Datapad" (stylized with chunky buttons and a flickering CRT  display) containing "Poacher's Notes." These notes describe the treasure we looted in the earlier task, "O ligarchy Off-Cuts," detailing a hidden cache of untagged gator glands.

### Tainted T allow (Replaces: Dirty Funds - Level 2 equivalent)

Head south-east until you find some towering, algae -covered concrete remnants of a pre-Calamity flood barrier, upon which our destination lies. Make your way south to  reach the western end of the barrier to find a precarious series of rusted ladders and makeshift ramps leading to the top. ** Swamp Scrappers** (desperate outcasts, often exhibiting minor mutations), however, might object to you simply walking in  and ransacking their hideout. Dispatch the first two you meet (watch for improvised nail-guns and sharpened scrap metal).  Continue uphill to find another four, including a tougher, hulking Scrapper wielding a stop sign mounted on a pipe ( functioning as a makeshift shield). Save him for last and exterminate his support with your trusty (and culturally approved) firearm . When only the shield-bearer remains, you'll have to find a way to get around his crude defense. You  can either blast him with a focused sonic burst from your "Gator-Caller" (if you've jury-rigged one  with such a function, adhering to the 70s aesthetic for its casing) to disorient him, then get around  him for a few quick hits, or just parry his clumsy attacks. Once they're dead, let the looting begin! 

Near the beginning of the hideout, you'll find a tattered tent near a sputtering solar-powered lamp , near which you'll find assorted synth-sacks, oil drums, and plastic crates to loot. Further uphill under  another patched-up awning are even more sacks and parcels. North-east of here, near where the shield-sc rapper and his buddies were, you'll find a somewhat sturdier, pre-Calamity emergency shelter,  outside of which are some reinforced crates, a bio-luminescent fungus barrel, and another package. Inside the shelter, you' ll find three chests—two large, wood-paneled footlockers near a filthy mattress, and a smaller ammo  box in a corner. When the smaller box is looted, the task "Tainted Tallow" will be completed ( revealing illegally rendered animal fat, definitely not gator). On a makeshift shelf made of cinder blocks and planks, you'll  find a "Water-Stained Memo" on what looks like old fax paper, addressed to a "Foreman Th ibbodeaux" in Lickskillet, hinting at illicit trade bypassing the Meat Oligarchy's control.

###  Exploring Western Lickskillet Bayou

Only one more bit of exploration to do before we finally go pay a visit to the local Meat  Oligarchy representative (or perhaps a Swamp Witch for information). Return to Lickskillet proper and do what business you need to  do (maybe trade some gator skins for solar cells or ammo). Then follow the main raised boardwalk through Lickskillet , heading west (and slightly south). Pass the "Gator-Bite Grill" (Notice Board equivalent), the  smoking ruins of a 'shiner's still, and past Mama Agnes's shack (an old Erpenthrope who  mostly keeps to herself) to the north. It should be pretty easy to stay on the main boardwalk and avoid any det ours onto treacherous swamp trails. Keep going south-west until you spot another half-submerged pre-Calamity bungalow  north of the boardwalk, wherein you can score some scavenged supplies.

Get back on the main boardwalk heading south- west and continue to follow it in that direction until you spot a small, muddy trail veering off in a more radical south -western direction, which ends near a ruined airboat dock. Inside the collapsed boathouse are two waterlogged bodies for  you to loot (likely victims of **Vampire Bunnies** or a misjudged swim). Do so, then return  to the main boardwalk again. Carry on until you spot a Meat Oligarchy "Resource Collection Point" south of the boardwalk , this one surprisingly free of the usual propaganda posters featuring deified celebrity mascots. There are more items to loot here ( mostly gator processing byproducts and discarded tools), but again, you'll have to be careful not to let the  armed Oligarchy Thugs (likely low-level enforcers with a bad reputation for Automaton use) see you.  They're more vigilant here, so you might not be able to get everything.

*Note: In between this camp  and the "Sunken Highway" landmark, you might encounter **Swamp Striders** (fast, insectoid creatures that  hunt in packs) or the occasional solitary **Adolescent Solar Gator** that's wandered from a farm.*

###  Reclaimed Processing Shack (Replaces: Abandoned Site)

When you're done looting, return to the boardwalk again . This time our aim is to follow one of two other rickety boardwalks to the north that connect to the one  we were on... and with each other, forming a triangle on your map display (if your retro-handheld device  is still functional). These boardwalks, once joined, lead north to the "Old Sawmill" landmark (now just  a collection of rusted metal in the muck). West of this landmark is another Reclaimed Processing Shack currently occupied by a quartet  of **Bog Ghouls** (devolved humans, victims of prolonged exposure to Calamity mutagens). Kill  them, and some hardy Swamp Folk (likely independent gator trappers) will move in to the area, even being  so kind as to set up a **Makeshift Workbench** (for weapon and gear maintenance, all with that 70s  vibe) for you to use.

Loot the newly-inhabited shacks and the nearby collapsed gator pen . There are even a few **Giant Irradiated Beehives** around. The bees will sting you if you get too  close, of course, and their venom can cause temporary paralysis (again, piling on the absurdity of post-Calamity nature ). Use your **Solar Lighter** (a common piece of 70s-style tech) or a well-aim ed flare on the hive to pacify the bees and cause the hive to fall, which you can loot for **Glowing Honeycomb**.  Don't sell any of this yet, as the local **Swamp Witch** (when we can finally get her to talk ) will give you a pretty penny for them, or trade for potent ritual components. Last and not least, a new scavenger -merchant will show up here sooner or later. He doesn't sell anything earth-shatteringly good (mostly  scavenged junk and stale protein paste), but it's another place you can drop off excess gator hides for some much- needed "Trade Chits" (local currency).

**Objective** | **Reward**

For liberating the  Reclaimed Processing Shack | 90 XP (Experience Points)

### Scrapper Ambush (Replaces: Bandit Camp) 

From the formerly-Abandoned Shack, head north through the dense, bio-luminescent mangroves, perhaps stopping to harvest  some mutated flora or fight off some more **Gator-Pups**. Eventually, you'll find a Scrapper Ambush point , occupied by the usual desperate, poorly-equipped scavengers. Defeat them, then search around their crude lean-tos  for goodies—most of which is located around their central fire pit (fueled by rendered gator fat). The best loot can be  found in a locked tool chest behind a makeshift barricade of tires and corrugated metal, and in a waterlogged duffel bag beside  a moldy sleeping roll.

### Oligarchy Cache (Replaces: Guarded Treasure)

To the north is a  bubbling, noxious marsh, where we'll likely face the old hazard of **Murkfiends** (amphibious human oids adapted to toxic waters), and a new hazard—pockets of explosive methane. The latter can be used, in conjunction with your  Solar Lighter or a well-placed shot, to help deal with the former, if you're sneaky like that. Just  be wary—methane is wonderfully combustible, but it's also disorienting. North-west of the Scrapper Ambush  point, you'll find an Oligarchy Cache, constituting a dead Oligarchy Thug, his wrecked fan-boat, and a  reinforced strongbox lying in the muck. Dispatch any Murkfiends or **Bloatflies** guarding it and get  to looting.

*Note: Stay out of the deep marsh at night, as it'll be crawling with Mur kfiends and larger, more aggressive swamp predators. Unless you want to fight a bunch of them, of course. In  which case... head into the marsh at night! They're some of the few critters that drop valuable glands, and it's  really the only way to scrounge for rare components at this point in time. You may also find solitary **Er penthropes** in their beast forms in the deep swamp. They're rare, avoid contact unless provoked,  and not terribly difficult to *evade* if you're quick.*

### Hot Merchandise (Replaces: Precious Cargo)

 Travel east through the marsh and, eventually, you should come to a slightly more stable patch of raised earth with a barely visible  trail running more or less north-south. Follow it south and out of the worst of the marsh until you hear somebody  calling for you east of the trail. Head over there to find a nervous-looking fellow in worn, but clean,  70s-style coveralls, fiddling with a sputtering solar charger by a small campfire. Ask him what's wrong and  he'll vaguely babble about some "big-toothed horrors" in the marsh. Geralt, annoyed by the  amateurish attempt at deception (especially if he's an Erpenthrope used to seeking truth), sets him straight. The  fellow will then tell a slightly more coherent story. Apparently, his cargo skiff was "swamped by a rogue wave" ( unlikely in these parts) caused by a giant, unseen swamp beast, and he wants you to go find his goods ... or at least a "small, reinforced data-case" that seems to be particularly important to him. Agree to help him,  then... well, head back north into the marsh (after tracking the task in your wrist-mounted Pip-Boy- esque device, of course).

The site of the "attack" is only a short way to the north; just follow the trail  and keep your enhanced senses (or a jury-rigged scanner) active. You should spot some fresh drag marks running  off the trail and into the marsh. Investigate them, loot a nearby discarded ration pack, then veer north-west into  the marsh. Near the center of the new search area, just west of a half-sunken pre-Calamity  satellite dish, you'll find the skiff, a dead pack-gator (not a wild one, but domesticated ), and the scattered cargo. Check the gator and the skiff to observe that they've been hit with high-caliber  rounds from a rifle—not too many swamp beasts use those. Continue looking around with your senses to spot a body to the east , also the victim of gunfire. You come to the only logical conclusion—our "merchant" friend lied. The data -case we're looking for is just north of the wreckage, partially submerged. Pick up the "Locked Data-Case" and  return to the "merchant."

You can simply give the faker his data-case back, which ends the task, but it 's more interesting to call him out on his deception and find out what all the lies (not to mention the bullet  holes) were about. Take him to task for lying and he'll pull the old "look out, a giant mutant  gator!" gag. Sadly, he doesn't realize your senses (or your companion Automaton, despite the social stigma of  using one) are too acute for that nonsense. Instead of coming clean, however, he tries to make a break for it .

**Objective** | **Reward**
---|---
For returning the data-case no questions asked |  25 XP
20 Trade Chits

Chase the liar south along the trail (or through the shallow water if you're  quick). He's not as nimble as you, so you shouldn't have any trouble catching him. Once you do, a  non-lethal takedown (or a warning shot) will make him reconsider. After he recovers, he'll spill the  beans—he's a smuggler, trying to move untaxed tech components (specifically, advanced solar converters that  bypass the Oligarchy's monopoly) to independent settlements in the deeper bayou. The data-case contains schematics and  access codes vital for their self-sufficiency, potentially undermining the Meat Oligarchy's stranglehold on power and tech. You  now have three choices:
1.  Turn him and the data-case over to the nearest Oligarchy patrol ( they'll likely "confiscate" the tech and the smuggler will face harsh judgment, possibly involving a rigged  "trial" presided over by an LLM, further tainting his reputation).
2.  Let him go with  the data-case to help the independents.
3.  Let him go, but keep the data-case and its valuable  schematics/components for yourself (they could be very useful, or fetch a high price).

Your personal code ( perhaps influenced by Erpenthrope truth-seeking, or a simple distaste for the Oligarchy, or even a belief in the  "deified" ideals of anti-authoritarianism embodied by Jerry Reed) will guide you. While direct involvement isn 't usually your style, the pervasive influence of the Oligarchy is hard to ignore, and the tech could genuinely help  people... or yourself.

**Objective** | **Reward**

### Sacred Ground (Replaces: Place of Power)

You're now south of the Old Sawmill landmark,  and all the fun stuff we have left to do is back north. So... slog it back north. Our next destination is between  the two murky channels that run north-south through the marsh, east of the Scrapper Ambush point we cleared out  earlier. It's worth exploring the lightly irradiated, fungus-covered hummocks between the two channels, however, as they contain  valuable mutated herbs to harvest, **Feral Hogs** and **Giant Bullfrogs** to hunt, and more  **Giant Irradiated Beehives** to raid. The place of interest here, however, is a patch of Sacred Ground whose  location was previously disclosed by a cryptic utterance from a ghost contacted via ritual. It's guarded by a level six **Ling ering Specter** (a powerful, tormented remnant from the Biological Calamity, possibly an early victim). We've encountered  similar entities before, so this should be manageable with the right tools (perhaps a "Spectral Disruptor" built with  70s tech aesthetics, or specific ritual preparations). You might want to consider saving your progress on your handheld device before  you engage it, as it has a chance to drop **Ectoplasmic Residue**. Getting a dose of this will allow  us to upgrade one of our weapons with spectral properties (preferably a melee weapon for close encounters) or enhance a piece of sensory  equipment, saving us a good haul of Trade Chits in the process. In any event, draw upon the spiritual energy of  the Sacred Ground (perhaps by touching a strangely preserved statue of Burt Reynolds inexplicably found here).

### Sunken Supplies  (Replaces: Guarded Treasure)

Head over to the eastern of the two channels that cut up through the marsh and ... well, wade or swim up through it. Along this eastern channel, you'll find a "Sunken Supplies" event . You know the drill—several **Murkfiends** or perhaps a pack of aggressive **Snapping Turtles** are  guarding some loot. Kill them and take what's yours.

### Wreckage Riches (Replaces: Spoils of  War)

Continue north-west along the channel until you pass under a collapsed pre-Calamity overpass ( a concrete arch). After the arch, veer off to the north-east and go for a swim (or use a small  raft if you've found one) to the east to find the "Wreckage Riches" event. Near a wrecked  fan-boat that's somehow still partially afloat, tangled in giant lily pads, take a dive to find some valuable  salvage near another, completely submerged hovercraft.
