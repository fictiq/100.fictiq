overview:
  quest_name: "Vampire Bunny Blues"
  locations:
    - " Murkwater Mire (a dense, Cthulhu-goth-Southern flavored swamp region near Licksk illet)"
    - "An abandoned Gator-Gulp processing outpost"
  quest_giver: "Maman Zulé , a reclusive Swamp Witch"
  suggested_player_level: "5-8"
  estimated _playtime: "1.5 - 2.5 hours"
  brief: |
    Maman Zulé,  a known (if feared) purveyor of Vampire Bunnies, reports her normally vibrant, slightly sinister lagomorphs are list less, their characteristic "blood-moon glow" dimming. She suspects an unnatural cause and requests an investigation, offering unique  alchemical rewards and her (grudging) favor.
  themes:
    - "Environmental impact of unchecked industry "
    - "The fragility of unusual ecosystems"
    - "Uncovering corporate malfeasance"
     - "The intersection of folk magic and retro-technology"

context_within_primal_mama:
  introduction: " This quest aims to showcase several core elements of Primal Mama:"
  elements:
    - "Vampire  Bunnies & Swamp Witches: Directly involves these unique entities and their esoteric knowledge (Alethic, Epistemic modalities )."
    - "1970s Tech Aesthetic: The source of the problem will be tied to malfunctioning or improperly used  technology adhering to this aesthetic (Alethic modality)."
    - "Meat Oligarchy's Influence: The quest will hint at  or directly involve the carelessness or deliberate cost-cutting of a larger meat processing entity, creating \"friction\" (Deontic, Axi ological modalities)."
    - "Swamp Environment: The investigation will take the player deep into the bayou."
    - " Spiritual Miasma: The health of the Vampire Bunnies is subtly tied to the local \"spiritual miasma,\" which M aman Zulé is sensitive to (Axiological, Epistemic modalities)."
    - "Erpenthrope  Protagonist (Assumed): The player character, if an Erpenthrope, can leverage their \"truth-seeking\"  nature and unique senses."

quest _walkthrough:
  - step:
      step_number: 1
      title: "Initiation : A Witch's Worry"
      description: |
        The PC arrives at Maman Zulé's secluded  hovel in Murkwater Mire, perhaps guided by local rumors of "bunny-blight" or a direct, cryptic summons  (a bone-whistle left at a known Erpenthrope haunt).
        Maman Zulé explains the Vampire  Bunnies are weak, their distinctive crimson glow barely visible. She tasks the PC with finding the cause, offering a rare  alchemical recipe or a potent fetish as reward.
      dialogue_example:
        character: "Maman  Zulé"
        line: "_\"The little blood-drinkers... they fade, Erpenthrope.  Their inner fire dims. The swamp feels it. *I* feel it. This ain't natural.\"_"
      functional_ integration_notes: "(Functional Integration: Maman Zulé's `FUNC-ZULE-BUNNYL ORE-01` and `FUNC-ZULE-MIASMASENSE-01` establish the problem.) "
  - step:
      step_number: 2
      title: "Investigation: The Fading Glow"
       description: |
        Maman Zulé directs the PC to a nearby warren where the bunnies are visibly unwell.
         PC (using `FUNC-ERPEN-SENSE-01 Primal Senses`):
          - Examine the bunnies : They are lethargic, fur is matted, usual faint scent of iron and swamp-musk is tainted with an  acrid, chemical odor. Their glow is indeed weak.
          - Scan the area: Faint, unusual tracks  (not animal) leading away from the warren towards an old, disused alligator processing runoff channel. A strange, oily  residue clings to some of the wilted vegetation near the channel.
      functional_integration_notes: "(Functional Integration: PC' s Primal Senses are crucial for gathering initial clues.)"
  - step:
      step_number:  3
      title: "Tracking: The Oily Trail"
      description: |
        The PC follows  the tracks and the chemical scent deeper into a less-traveled part of Murkwater Mire. The trail is marked by  increasingly sick or dead swamp critters (mutated frogs, listless mudskippers).
        The 197 0s aesthetic is evident in discarded, rusted barrels with faded "Gator-Gulp Inc." logos.
        Eventually,  the trail leads to an old, forgotten Gator-Gulp processing outpost, seemingly abandoned but with a faint hum of machinery.
       functional_integration_notes: "(Functional Integration: PC's `SKL-PLAYER-SURVIVAL-0 1` for tracking. The environment reflects past industrial activity adhering to the `Technological Aesthetic Constraint`.)"
   - step:
      step_number: 4
      title: "The Source: Retro-Tech Rot" 
      description: |
        The outpost features a large, dilapidated filtration unit (`OBJ_GATORGULPFILTER_ 70S_01`) with chunky, rusted levers, flickering analog dials, and wood-paneled control boxes.  A thick, iridescent sludge is leaking from a cracked pipe at its base, flowing directly into the runoff channel.
        PC (using  `SKL-PLAYER-TECHLORE-01 Retro-Tech Familiarity`): Can identify the unit as  a waste filter. The dials show dangerously high pressure readings and erratic power fluctuations. The leak is obvious.
        Optional  Encounter: Jebediah "Jeb" Coker (`NPC_COKER_GATORGULP_FOREMAN_01 `), a surly Gator-Gulp foreman, might be found making a cursory (and ineffective) inspection or trying to patch the  leak with duct tape and wishful thinking.
      dialogue_example:
        character: "Jeb Coker "
        line: "_\"Just a bit of overflow, son. Nothin' your fancy kind needs to  worry about. This here's official Gator-Gulp business.\"_"
      options_with_jeb:  "PC can use Erpenthrope intimidation (`FUNC-ERPEN-TRANSFORM-01` implied or partially shown ), present evidence of the dying bunnies, or attempt to reason/bribe him. Jeb might try to stonewall, threaten , or offer a paltry bribe to look the other way. He fears his bosses finding out more than local swamp life."
       functional_integration_notes: "(Functional Integration: The filter unit's `INAB-FILTER-SEAL- 01` and `VULN-FILTER-CLOG-01` are evident. Jeb's `FUNC-CO KER-AUTHORITY-01` and `VULN-COKER-EXPOSURE-01`  drive his responses.)"
  - step:
      step_number: 5
      title: "Resolution : Plugging the Leak & The Witch's Due"
      sub_steps:
        - title: "Dealing with  the Filter"
          description: |
            Technical Fix: The PC, using `SKL-PLAYER-TECHLORE- 01`, might identify a jammed pressure release valve or a critical component that needs reseating/replacing. This could involve  finding a specific retro-part nearby (e.g., a "Mark IV Hydro-Spanner" in a rusted  toolbox) or using Erpenthrope strength (`FUNC-ERPEN-TRANSFORM-01` partially) to  force a lever or seal a pipe temporarily. The 1970s aesthetic means a physical, chunky interaction.
            Con fronting Jeb: If Jeb is present and uncooperative, the PC might need to intimidate him into shutting down the unit or  reporting the issue. Combat is possible but not the primary solution. A successful intimidation might make Jeb reluctantly fix it or call in a ( slow, bureaucratic) repair crew.
        - title: "Reporting to Maman Zulé"
          description:  |
            Return to Maman Zulé and inform her of the findings.
            She expresses disgust at "Gator-G ulp's poison" but is pleased the source is identified.
            She may perform a small ritual (`FUNC-Z ULE-RITUAL-01`) over a symbolic bunny effigy or ask the PC to gather a few specific , mundane swamp herbs (Gator-grass, Moonpetal Moss) to help her concoct a "spiritual balm" for the  warrens. This is more about her reasserting balance than a direct cure.
          dialogue_example:
             character: "Maman Zulé"
            line: "_\"The miasma... it breathes a little easier now . But the little ones still carry the taint.\"_"
      functional_integration_notes: "(Functional Integration: PC' s problem-solving and potential use of Erpenthrope abilities. Maman Zulé's ritualistic knowledge provides a  thematic capstone.)"

rewards:
  - "Experience Points."
  - "Crowns/Barter Goods from M aman Zulé."
  - "Unique Alchemical Recipe: \"Maman Zulé's Blood-Moon Brew \" (temporary boost to night vision and stealth) OR a Fetish of Lagomorphic Vigor (minor passive health regeneration)." 
  - "Increased Reputation: With Swamp Witches (if such a faction exists) or positive standing with Maman Zulé  for future interactions."
  - "Information: Maman Zulé might offer a cryptic clue related to a larger world mystery  or the \"invisible women\" conspiracy, tying into the Erpenthrope's truth-seeking nature."
  -  "Moral Satisfaction: For helping the weird little bunnies and sticking it (gently or not) to a corporate entity."

potential_ complications_and_follow_ups:
  - "Jeb Coker could report the PC to his Gator-Gulp  superiors, leading to future \"friction\" or even bounty hunters with 70s-style stun prods."
  -  "The filter fix might be temporary, requiring a more complex solution or a different quest to acquire rare 1970s- era replacement parts."
  - "Other Swamp Witches might hear of the PC's deed, opening up new,  stranger quests."
  - "The \"spiritual balm\" ingredients could be in a dangerous part of the swamp, guarded  by other creatures or even rival, less scrupulous individuals."

design_notes_adherence_to_coherence_protocol :
  introduction: "This quest, \"Vampire Bunny Blues,\" should provide a flavorful slice of Primal Mama, allowing  the player to engage with its unique elements in a coherent and logical manner, as defined by the world's own established rules ."
  modalities_adherence:
    alethic: "The existence of Vampire Bunnies, Swamp  Witches, GE Alligators (implied by Gator-Gulp), and the 1970s tech  aesthetic are core. The problem (contamination) and solution (fixing retro-tech) are within these bounds."
    deontic : "Gator-Gulp's negligence showcases a disregard for local well-being, reflecting the \"friction\" from meat  oligarchies. Maman Zulé operates by her own swamp laws."
    axiological: "Maman Zulé values  the health of her creations and the swamp's balance. The PC (especially Erpenthrope) values truth/solving the mystery . Gator-Gulp values profit."
    epistemic: "Maman Zulé possesses esoteric knowledge. The PC uses  investigative knowledge (Primal Senses). The truth of Gator-Gulp's pollution is uncovered."
    historical _temporal: "The abandoned outpost suggests a past industrial presence consistent with the post-calamity shift to alligator processing." 
    synchronic: "The coexistence of Swamp Witch magic, retro-tech, and unique creatures is central. The contamination  affects the local ecosystem in a consistent way."
    complexity_management: "The quest focuses on a single, quirky problem (sick  bunnies) but uses it to touch upon broader world themes (corporate negligence, retro-tech, swamp magic) without becoming  overwhelming. The core elements (bunnies, witch, pollution, 70s tech) are interlinked."
