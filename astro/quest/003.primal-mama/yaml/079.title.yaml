introduction: |
  Alright,  swamp-dweller. Livin' ain't easy between the gator farms, the backwater weirdness,  and keepin' your rig runnin' on sunshine and sheer cussedness. To keep breathin' and maybe  put a bigger dent in those oversized GE lizards (or whatever else crawls out the muck), you need gear that works. Good  gear. And that means scroungin' and buildin'.

  You'll find bits and pieces scattered around –  old pre-Calamity junk, discarded gator parts, maybe even some high-falutin' Beetriot tech someone  dropped off their sky-barge. Pullin' apart busted equipment or useless scrap is always an option. But sometimes , you need somethin' *better*. Somethin' refined. That's when you find yourself a local ** Tinkerer** – could be a back-alley welder in Lickskillet, a Hide Tanner out near the Saur ian Sanctuary boundary, maybe even one of them solar-savvy types who keeps the gator bio-batteries topped off.

   They can take your common junk and, with the right know-how (and maybe a bit of swamp magic or  70s ingenuity), turn it into the good stuff. Most of these schematics are common knowledge, probably rattlin' around in  your head already. Just remember: everything's gotta have that *look* – chunky, maybe some wood paneling , definitely no sleek minimalist nonsense. Function over high fashion, but style still counts.

specialized_ammunition:
  section_title: II.  Specialized Harpoon Gun Ammunition
  introduction: |
    Standard harpoons get the job done on smaller gators , but sometimes you need a little extra persuasion for the big ones, rival claim jumpers, or those things the Swamp Witches  cook up. Remember, crafting this stuff might attract attention – especially if you need parts only found deep in the Saurian Sanctuary. 
  note: Your standard Harpoon Gun likely came with a near-endless supply of basic Reclaimed Steel Tipped Har poons. These custom loads are for special occasions.
