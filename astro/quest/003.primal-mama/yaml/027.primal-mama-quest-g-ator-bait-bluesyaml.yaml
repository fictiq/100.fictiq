  overview:
    logline:  "A desperate Lickskillet gator processor, Mama June, is losing her livelihood as her prime alligator catches are being mysteriously  \"spooked\" or stolen right from her traps before she can harvest them. She suspects foul play from the encroaching Consolidated Cro c Corp (CCC) and needs an outsider to investigate without drawing CCC's direct ire."
    locations:
       - "Lickskillet (Mama June's Processing Shack)"
      - surrounding Bayou trap lines
      - potential hidden  CCC outpost/facility
    suggested_player_level: "5-8 (assuming a leveling system)"
    primary_ objectives:
      - "Investigate the disturbances at Mama June's trap lines."
      - "Identify  the cause of the missing/spooked gators."
      - "Neutralize the threat to Mama June' s operation."
    potential_rewards:
      - Crowns (currency)
      - XP
      - Reputation increase  in Lickskillet
      - "Unique 1970s-aesthetic schematic (e.g.,  \"Gator Sonar Lure Mk. II\" or \"Camouflaged Trap Emitter\")"
      -  "A prized cut of \"Mama June's Best\" alligator jerky."
    key_primal_mama_ elements_utilized:
      - Alligator-based economy and diet.
      - Bayou environment.
      -  "1970s tech aesthetic (even for nefarious devices)."
      - "Meat oligarchy (Consolidated  Croc Corp) vs. mom-and-pop operations."
      - "Potential for Automaton/LLM  involvement (as a red herring or minor tool)."
      - "Solar power reliance (for GE gators and tech )."

  walkthrough:
    a_the_hook_mama_junes_plea:
       title: "The Hook: Mama June's Plea"
      steps:
        - starting_point: | 
            The player arrives in Lickskillet. They might overhear worried whispers among locals about tough times for independent processors, or  Mama June herself (a stout, no-nonsense woman in her late 50s with a voice like gravel and  a heart of gold) might approach the player if they have a reputation for "fixin' things" or look capable .
        - the_problem:
            description: |
              Mama June explains that her gator traps, usually  reliable, have been coming up empty or showing signs of gators being violently scared off. Her best solar-charged GE  gators, which she relies on, are either vanishing or returning skittish and non-productive. She suspects Consolidated Croc Corp  (CCC), who have been trying to buy her out for months.
            dialogue_snippet_mama_june: " Them CCC vultures been circlin', tryin' to peck away at what little us small folk got left. Now  my gators are actin' like Burt Reynolds himself done told 'em a ghost story! Somethin' ain' t right, and it smells fishier than a week-old catfish in July."

    b_investigation_ bayou_blues:
      title: "Investigation: Bayou Blues"
      steps:
        - examine_ trap_lines:
            description: "The player follows Mama June (or directions) to her trap lines in the  bayou."
            clues:
              - id: clue_1
                modality_note: " Alethic: Possibility"
                text: "At the first few empty traps, player uses their \"Sw amp Savvy\" (Witcher Senses equivalent). They find unusually large, panicked thrash marks, but no alligator remains.  Some traps are damaged in a way inconsistent with normal alligator behavior."
              - id: clue_2
                mod ality_note: "Alethic: Possibility/Epistemic: Knowledge"
                text: "Further  along, they find a trap with a strange, faint, rhythmic hum. Using a basic 1970s -style \"Frequency Detector\" (chunky buttons, analog needle display), they isolate a peculiar sonic frequency."
              - id:  clue_3
                modality_note: "Alethic: Impossibility/Possibility"
                 text: "Near another trap, they find a patch of swamp grass that’s been oddly flattened, not by an alligator, but  by something with a regular, mechanical pattern. Perhaps faint oil traces that don't match local flora/fauna."
            optional _complication_red_herring:
              modality_note: "Deontic/Epistemic "
              text: "Player might find a discarded, damaged datachip near a trap. If they try to  get it read in Lickskillet, the local tech (who uses an Automaton for diagnostics) might be ostracized,  or the chip might contain harmless agricultural data, leading the player to suspect Automaton sabotage, a common fear/prejudice."

     c_tracing_the_source_the_hum_in_the_swamp:
      title: "Tracing the Source : The Hum in the Swamp"
      steps:
        - follow_the_frequency: "Using the Frequency Detector,  the player tracks the sonic emissions deeper into a less-traveled part of the bayou."
        - obstacles: 
            items:
              - "Natural swamp hazards (e.g., territorial non-GE gators, vampire bunnies  – if only as environmental color, or a minor threat if disturbed)."
              - "Perhaps a few low-level CCC \" security\" drones (stylized with 1970s aesthetics – boxy, maybe with wood paneling,  but functionally still drones) that patrol the perimeter of the source. These would be designed to scare, not necessarily kill, to maintain plausible  deniability."
        - discovery: "The player discovers a hidden, camouflaged CCC sub-station.  It's solar-powered (large, clunky solar panels artfully blended with the swamp) and features a prominent , chunky antenna array emitting the disruptive sonic frequency. The station itself adheres to the 1970s tech aesthetic  (control panels with large toggle switches, CRT-style monitors displaying simple wave patterns)."

    d_confrontation _disrupting_the_disruption:
      title: "Confrontation: Disrupting the Disruption "
      steps:
        - infiltration_assault:
            description: "The player must find a way into the sub -station."
            approaches:
              - type: Stealth
                details: "Sneak past patrols and disable external security  measures (e.g., re-wiring a chunky junction box)."
              - type: Combat
                details:  "Engage CCC Enforcers (Humans with standard firearms of the era)."
        - the_device: " Inside, they find the \"Sonic Scarecrow Mk. III\" – a large, console-like machine with multiple oscillators and a  complex (but analog-looking) control panel. It’s clearly designed to emit frequencies that terrify alligators.  Schematics on a nearby table (hand-drawn with 1970s drafting style) confirm its purpose." 
        - the_choice:
            options:
              - action: "Destroy the Device"
                description : "The most direct approach. Plant an explosive or sabotage its core components (pulling out vacuum tubes, smashing control panels ). This will likely cause a significant commotion and alert CCC more directly."
              - action: "Reprogram/Disable  the Device"
                description: "A more subtle approach. If the player has technical skills (or finds a manual ), they might be able to alter the frequency to something harmless, or simply shut it down without major destruction. This might  leave CCC unaware of who interfered for a while."
              - action: "Gather Evidence"
                description: "Take  the schematics and perhaps a key component of the device to expose CCC to local authorities or a rival corporation (if one  exists/player knows of one). This is riskier but could have wider implications."

    e_resolution_licks killet_harmony:
      title: "Resolution: Lickskillet Harmony?"
      steps:
         - return_to_mama_june: "The player reports their findings and actions."
        - consequences_ based_on_players_choice:
            options:
              - choice: "Device Destroyed"
                 outcome: "Mama June is overjoyed. Lickskillet celebrates. CCC will likely investigate and may send more aggressive agents later ( leading to potential follow-up quests)."
              - choice: "Device Disabled/Reprogrammed"
                outcome : "Mama June is relieved. Things return to normal, but the threat of CCC reactivating or deploying a new device  looms. CCC is less likely to trace it back to the player immediately."
              - choice: "Evidence Gathered "
                outcome: "Mama June is cautious but hopeful. This path could lead to a larger narrative arc involving legal  battles, corporate espionage, or even rallying other small processors against CCC. The immediate problem might not be fully solved."
         - rewards_distributed: "Mama June pays the player. Reputation in Lickskillet changes. Player receives any unique schematics  or items promised."

  primal_mama_codex_integration_and_coherence_checks:
    al ethic_modality:
      - "The existence of GE solar-powered gators is central."
       - "The 1970s tech aesthetic is strictly applied to the CCC Sonic Scarecrow and player's  Frequency Detector."
      - "Solar power is the source for the CCC sub-station."
      - "Vampire bunnies  might make a cameo as environmental hazards, their authenticated existence upheld."
    deontic_modality:
       - "CCC's actions are illegal/unethical (sabotage)."
      - "The player operates outside formal law enforcement,  as is common in such settings."
      - "The (optional) Automaton/LLM user stigma is touched  upon as a potential social dynamic."
    axiological_modality:
      - "The quest highlights the value  of self-reliance (Mama June) vs. corporate greed (CCC)."
      - "Alligator meat is shown  as a vital resource."
      - "The 1970s aesthetic is the accepted norm for technology." 
    epistemic_modality:
      - "The player uncovers hidden knowledge (CCC's plot )."
      - "The nature of the Sonic Scarecrow technology (advanced function, retro shell) is a piece of  world-specific knowledge."
      - "Misinformation (blaming Automaton users) could be a minor theme." 
    historical_and_temporal_coherence:
      - "The conflict between established mom-and-pop businesses  and newer, aggressive corporations like CCC is a logical outgrowth of a post-calamity society rebuilding its economy."
     synchronic_coherence:
      - "The bayou environment, the 1970s tech , and the alligator-centric economy coexist. The Sonic Scarecrow, while perhaps using advanced acoustic principles, *looks* like it  was built in 1978."
      - "The actions of CCC are plausible given their desire to dominate  the market."

  designer_notes_and_potential_expansions:
    notes :
      - "The \"Sonic Scarecrow\" could be a piece of repurposed pre-Calamity tech, retrofitted by  CCC with a 1970s interface. This could tie into deeper lore about what technology survived or was rediscovered ."
      - "If the player chooses to gather evidence, a follow-up quest could involve navigating Lickskillet' s (or even Beetriot's) corrupt local bureaucracy or trying to find a media outlet (perhaps a pirate radio station  broadcasting Burt Reynolds sermons?) willing to expose CCC."
      - "The optional Automaton/LLM red herring could  be expanded if desired, perhaps with a side-character in Lickskillet who *is* being unfairly targeted due  to their use of such tools, and the player can choose to help them clear their name separately."
      - " The specific design of the Frequency Detector should be pure 1970s: a handheld box with an antenna, a dial  for tuning, and a needle gauge that jumps when near the target frequency, perhaps with an earphone for audio feedback ( crackles and a distinct tone)."
      - "The \"Vampire Bunnies\" could be an alternative cause  investigated by the player, only to find out it's *also* CCC experimenting with biological disruption methods, or a  Swamp Witch whose territory was encroached upon by Mama June or CCC. This adds another layer of weirdness. For this  quest, I've kept them as minor environmental color, but they *could* be the primary method of sabotage."
