  introduction: >
    We're probably pushing  Technician Rank Twenty, or soon will be.
    Those custom-modded Enhanced 'Gator-Wrangler'  Electro-Machetes have zapped plenty of rogue bio-forms,
    but we'll need something with more reliable  stopping power, soon.
    Word on the under-channels is that blueprints for an "Enhanced Solar-Charged Prod"
     might just be the ticket for dealing with… *unusual* entities.
    The associated "Insulated Gator-Hide  Rig" is also said to be top-tier protective wear
    for navigating hazardous bio-zones… once you get all the components  synthesized, anyways.
    This data-retrieval op will cover getting those schematics…
    and maybe uncovering  a few forgotten truths along the way.

  steps:
    - step_id: 1
      name: "Accessing the Ancient  Drainage Culvert"
      fast_travel_point: "\"Celestial Plaza Terminus\" – Beetriot Dam Sector." 
      directions:
        - "From the monorail terminus, head west towards the Dam's main spill way observation deck."
        - "Descend the rusted emergency stairs to the north (marked \"Sub-Level Access  7\")."
        - "At the bottom, turn west again, and duck under the massive, algae -covered cooling pipes."
        - "Go down another flight of equally treacherous stairs immediately after the primary hydro-turbine  housing ends."
        - "Continue west along the narrow, damp service walkway until you find a grated ramp angling down to  the north, into what looks like an old overflow channel."
        - "When the ramp ends, carefully navigate down some  crumbling concrete steps to the south, heading downhill along the stained plasteel walls of forgotten generator substations."
        - " When the substation structures give way to raw, damp earth and exposed bedrock, turn south-west."
        - "Skirt  around the western side of a cluster of humming, moss-covered transformer units (best not to touch those) to the north  until the path terminates at a precarious ledge overlooking a dark, water-filled cistern."
        - "Carefully drop down onto  a narrow concrete lip."
        - "From here, proceed north, then north-east, wading through knee-deep , murky water until you find the gaping maw of an unlit ancient drainage culvert – looks like it predates even the  1970s aesthetic overlay of the Dam."

        mechanism: " Chunky, 1970s-style Manual Levers connected to each effigy."
        solution_ hint: "Most need two shoves; Gram's effigy might be correctly positioned."
