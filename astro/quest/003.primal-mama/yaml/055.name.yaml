        The game begins with a familiar, humid warmth – the surprisingly functional solar-heated water of a reclaimed,
         avocado-green bathtub (1970s aesthetic on full display). The scarred, leathery feet that  frustrated some unseen
        peeper belong to Croc, our Erpenthrope, just tryin' to soak off the  swamp grime. The peace is shattered
        not by a crustacean, but by a sharp nip from a Vampire  Bunny, no doubt a mischievous sending from his
        Swamp Witch associate, Mama Odé. She materializes from the  steam and shadows, her Cthulhu-goth-Southern
        charm radiating disapproval.
      dialogue :
        - character: 'Mama Odé'
          line: "'Still lazin'' about, Cher? That little swamp  orchid, Lulu, is supposed to be learnin'' the proper incantations for wardin'' off rogue GE gator bio- feedback, not how to best stick crawdads in Pops Thibodeaux''s fishin'' boots!'"
       actions:
        - 'Croc and Mama Odé exchange some choice words.'
        - 'Croc and Mama  Odé slip into their worn denim and gator-hide-trimmed vests (1970s chic, naturally).'

        First  things first, though. The shack door is barred – not just against the swamp's usual toothy denizens,
         but also against the more... *unseen* things that whisper on the miasma. Croc needs the Shack Key Fob
         (a chunky piece of Bakelite with a faded image of Burt Reynolds on it).
      objective: 'Find the Shack Key  Fob.'

          Hold it down. The  world shifts; the usual grime and clutter are overlaid with faint auras,
          shimmering traces of energy, and the tell -tale glint of important objects. Think of it like
          tuning into a ghostly radio frequency, but for your  eyes.
        key_location_hint: >
          Over on a stack of well-loved 8-track tapes ( Gram Parsons' greatest hits, naturally) near the door,
          the Key Fob glows with a subtle insistence. 
      actions:
        - 'Croc snags the Key Fob.'

      actions: 
        - 'Croc unlocks the door and saunters down the creaky wooden stairs, Croc-style.'

        Once on the main  floor of the stilt shack (a delightful mix of scavenged tech and swamp detritus),
        Croc gr unts. His old Erpenthrope mentor, Pops Thibodeaux, who was supposed to be showing Lulu
         how to recalibrate the rooftop solar array (Solar Dominance is key, after all), is snoozing soundly 
        in a beaded doorway, an empty bottle of homebrewed gator-grape wine by his side.  Lulu, meanwhile,
        is out on the rickety porch, gleefully attempting to lasso a particularly feisty mutated bullfrog
         with a length of old antenna cable, nearly taking out a collection of prized glass insulators.

         - character: 'Croc'

          line: "'Those solar  conduits ain''t gonna align themselves, old man!'"
      actions:
        - 'Croc heads out  to have a word with Lulu.'
        - "Croc gives Lulu the usual 'don't antagonize the hyper -evolved amphibians' lecture."
