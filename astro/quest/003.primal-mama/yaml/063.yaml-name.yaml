  These ain' t your fancy pre-Calamity grenades, friend. These are what you cook up
  in the muck and  mire when something nasty needs persuadin' or a particularly
  stubborn patch of mutated growth needs clearin'. You 'll get a few when you first
  learn the recipe, but to make more, you gotta find a safe  spot (like your
  airboat's makeshift still or a Lickskillet workbench) and use some of  that
  potent Gator Shine to brew up a fresh batch. The better the recipe, the more
  you can carry,  and the meaner the punch.

  Throw 'em at mutated critters, aggressive flora, or use 'em to  blast open
  paths through Contaminated Thickets or Irradiated Fungal Blooms.
