    title: "Resonant Node (Neural Attunement )"
    area: "Bayou Sector - The Mirelands"
    requirements:
      - "Basic Skiff/ Watercraft"
    description: |
      Maneuver your skiff around the crumbling pylons of a  pre-Calamity structure half-submerged along the north-western edge of the main 'gator farm archipelago . Along the eastern bank of this small, overgrown island of concrete and rusted metal, you should detect faint energy readings with  your handheld scanner. This indicates a Resonant Node, likely an old solar relay or bio-feedback conduit still pulsing with residual energy . Interface with it carefully (risk of bio-feedback shock) to gain a Neural Attunement Point. Note the derel ict Solar Tower looming on the cliffs above, its access ramp long retracted. Access seems impossible from here.
    notes :
      - "Ironically, the way up involves going *down*."
    reward:
      name: Neural  Attunement Point
      description: "improves innate abilities or allows interface with more complex retro-tech" 
    risk: "Bio-feedback shock during interface"

    area: "Bayou Sector - The Mirelands (Under Resonant Node)"
    requirements:
       - "Hazard Suit / Good Lungs"
    recommended_gear:
      - "Basic Hazard Suit" 
      - "Harpoon Gun/Electro-Prod"
    description: |
      Dive off the south-eastern edge  of the Node island. Murky water conceals a maintenance tunnel leading under the structure. Feral Bio-Filters pollute  the tunnel. Use your harpoon gun to thin their numbers if needed, or try to navigate past their grasping pseudopods . Eventually, you'll find rusted rungs leading up a maintenance shaft. Surface and climb. Your reward for the  hazardous swim is a waterlogged footlocker containing surprisingly well-preserved Salvaged Components (Superior Quality) just east of the water logged entry point. Nearby, scale some crumbling ferrocrete ledges twice, then climb a maintenance ladder to reach the Rust water Spire level.
    potential_threats:
      - "Feral Bio-Filters (Level  10)"
    reward:
      name: "Salvaged Components (Superior Quality)"

  - id: rustwater_spire
    title: "Rustwater Spire"
     area: "Rustwater Spire"
    requirements:
      - Caution
    potential_threats:
       - Structural Instability
      - "Territorial Skyscale (Level 14)"
    description: |
      Asc end a set of grated stairs, scavenging a small parts chest and a discarded data chit (minor lore/flavor). Continue up  another flight, looting two more storage chests and three supply parcels (good haul of basic crafting materials and stim-packs). Head  through a doorway framed in faded orange plastic to the south-west, then turn south-east and find a manual winch  mechanism (classic 70s chunky lever). Crank it to lower the rusted access ramp, connecting the spire back to a precarious  cliff path. Cross the ramp to activate the "Rustwater Spire" Wayfinder Post on your map device. Good time to  log your progress (save game).

      Return to the Spire interior near the doorway you emerged from. Spot a rickety service  ladder leading to an upper platform housing the main solar collector array (or what's left of it). Up here are two more  chests, a functional grindstone (weapon maintenance), and other containers. We're primarily interested in the maintenance locker next to the  grindstone, along the south-eastern wall.

      Problem: The upper platform is the nesting ground of a Territorial  Skyscale (Level 14). It will make short work of an unprepared Runner. Your best bet is a quick smash-and -grab: sprint up the ladder, force the locker (requires decent Mechanics skill or a prybar), grab the contents (Old  Schematics, Schematic: Electro-Prod Mk II), and scramble back down (or drop, taking impact damage). If  successful, you'll have the plans for a powerful Level 7 Electro-Prod.
    loot:
      -  "small parts chest"
      - "discarded data chit"
      - "2 storage chests"
      - " 3 supply parcels"
