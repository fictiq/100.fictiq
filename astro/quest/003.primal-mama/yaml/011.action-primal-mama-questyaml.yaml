introduction:
  title: A Disappearing Act in  the Lickskillet Backwaters
  text: |
    The humid air of Lickskillet hangs heavy , thick with the scent of fried gator and the distant hum of solar converters. But for "Granny" Agnes  Perdue, a normally resilient mom-and-pop alligator rancher, the air is thick with worry. Her prize  genetically-engineered (GE) alligator, "Burt's Pride" – a magnificent 20-footer with  custom chrome-plated solar panels (strictly 70s aesthetic, of course) – has gone missing from its reinforced  pen. Without Burt's Pride, her small operation, already feeling the squeeze from the GatorCorp oligarchy, might just  go belly-up. She needs a savvy individual, someone who knows the swamp and isn't afraid of its stranger  denizens, to find her prized possession or, failing that, what happened to him.

quest_giver_and _location:
  quest_giver: '"Granny" Agnes Perdue'
  location: 'Perdue Gator Ranch,  a somewhat dilapidated but functional ranch on the outskirts of Lickskillet, bordering the deeper, less-charted swamp.' 
  suggested_player_level: '5-8'

objectives:
  - title: Talk  to Granny Agnes
    steps:
      - Travel to the Perdue Gator Ranch. Granny Agnes, a woman whose face  is a roadmap of bayou life, will be fretting near an empty, damaged alligator pen.
      - 'Listen  to her story: Burt''s Pride, her biggest and most reliable solar-gator, vanished overnight. The pen''s  analog lock system (chunky keypad, flickering LED display) was bypassed, and a section of the reinforced fence is bent  outwards.'
      - 'She suspects GatorCorp foul play ("Those slick-suited Beetriot vultures!"), but also mentions  local legends of Swamp Witches being particularly active lately. She''ll offer a reward of Pre-Calamity Bottlecaps and a  legendary family recipe for "Swamp Surprise Stew."'

  - title: "Investigate Burt's Pride's  Pen"
    steps:
      - description: 'Use your "Bayou Intuition" [Ability Button, e. g., L2/LT + R3] to examine the scene.'
        investigation_points:
          - 'Red  Highlight (Quest Object): Damaged Fence – Bent outwards, but scorch marks suggest something beyond brute force.'
           - 'Red Highlight (Quest Object): Bypassed Lock Panel – The wood-panelled casing is pried open, wires crud ely hotwired. The 1970s-style interface shows an "ERR: OVERRIDE" message  on its CRT-like display.'
          - 'Yellow Highlight (Clue): Strange, almost iridescent slime near the  damaged fence.'
          - 'Yellow Highlight (Clue): Faint, unusual humming sound, almost like a mis calibrated synthesizer, detected by your augmetic ear implant (if player has one, or just general keen hearing).'
       - commentary: '"Slime''s not gator. Smells... unnatural. And that humming... not standard tech malfunction ."'

  - title: (Optional) Question Lickskillet Locals
    steps:
      - Head into  Lickskillet proper.
      - 'Talk to Skeeter, the local junk dealer with a penchant for conspiracy  theories. He might mention seeing "glowing eyes" near Perdue''s ranch or talk about the "Invisible Women"  stealing prime gator stock. (Epistemic: Conspiracy)'
      - 'Talk to a disgruntled ex-G atorCorp technician (if player can find one, perhaps one with the "Automaton User Stigma"). They might recognize the type  of crude bypass on the lock panel as something a desperate amateur might try, or a sign of sabotage designed to *look * amateur.'

  - title: Follow the Trail into the Deep Swamp
    steps:
      - The slime  trail and the faint humming lead away from the ranch, deeper into the swamp.
      - The trail will pass by  signs of minor struggle – uprooted glowing fungi, disturbed mud.
      - encounter:
          type: A pack of 2 -3 Vampire Bunnies.
          function: 'Minor environmental hazard, source of the iridescent slime. Their bites seem  to drain energy, perhaps even from solar panels if they got too close to Burt''s Pride.'
      - Further along , the humming gets stronger. You find a discarded, broken chunk of what looks like a 1970s-style solar  panel, unmistakably from Burt's Pride, covered in the same slime.

  - title: Discover the Source of the  Humming (The "Nest")
    steps:
      - The trail leads to a strangely pulsating, bio-luminescent mound  of swamp detritus, glowing fungi, and discarded 1970s-era technological junk (old circuit boards with  chunky transistors, wood-panelled casings, etc.). This is where the humming is loudest.
      - "B urt's Pride is nearby, partially submerged in mud, looking listless. His chrome solar panels are dim and coated in the  iridescent slime. He occasionally thrashes weakly."
      - The mound itself is defended by a larger, more aggressive  Alpha Vampire Bunny and several regular ones.

  - title: Deal with the Vampire Bunny "Nest" and Rescue Burt's Pride 
    choice_point:
      title: Dealing with the Vampire Bunny Nest
      options:
        - name : Direct Assault
          description: Fight the Alpha Vampire Bunny and its minions. The Alpha is tougher, faster, and  its energy drain is more potent.
        - name: Esoteric Solution
          description: 'If the player has learned any  basic Swamp Witch counter-charms (perhaps from a previous encounter or a rare lore book), they might be able to  disrupt the "nest" with a specific ritual or item, causing the bunnies to scatter or weaken. This might involve finding specific  rare swamp herbs nearby.'
        - name: Technological Solution (Partial)
          description: 'The player might try  to use a salvaged sonic emitter (with a distinctly 70s feel – large dials, clunky antenna) to drive  the bunnies away, but the Alpha might be resistant.'
    post_choice_steps:
      - "Once  the bunnies are dealt with, examine Burt's Pride. His solar panels are fouled. The internal diagnostic panel (chunky  buttons, analog needle gauges) shows 'CRITICAL ENERGY DRAIN - FOREIGN SUBSTANCE DETECTED.'"

  - title : "Cleanse/Repair Burt's Pride"
    steps:
      - The slime needs to be removed.
       - options:
          - name: Technical Option
            description: 'If the player has solvent or can craft some, they  can try to clean the panels. This might require a mini-game of carefully applying the solvent without damaging the retro-tech components.' 
          - name: Ritual Option
            description: 'A local (perhaps a friendly Erpenthrope encountered, or  even Granny Agnes if she knows some old swamp lore) might know a cleansing ritual using specific swamp plants and blessed Burt Reynolds iconography to neutralize  the "curse" of the bunnies.'
          - name: Brute Force (Risky)
            description: Trying  to just scrape it off might damage the delicate (by 70s aesthetic standards) solar collectors.
      -  "Once cleansed, Burt's Pride's solar panels begin to slowly recharge (indicated by a satisfying 'ka- CHUNK' and a slowly brightening panel light). He might need a jump-start from a portable solar charger if the player has one , or be left in a sunny spot for a while."

  - title: Return to Granny Agnes
    steps:
       - Escort the slowly recovering Burt's Pride back to the ranch (he'll follow sluggishly).
       - 'Inform Granny Agnes of what happened:'
        - 'If you reveal the Vampire Bunnies, she''ll shudder . "Swamp Witches'' work, no doubt! Or one of them new-fangled bio-calamity critters !"'
        - 'If you mention GatorCorp suspicions, she''ll nod grimly, "Knew it ! They''re always tryin'' to run us little folk outta business!" (even if they weren''t involved ).'

coherence_notes:
  alethic_modalities:
    - "Relies on ` Alligator Biogenesis` (Burt's Pride's nature and solar power)."
    - Introduces ` Vampire Bunny Propagation` as a direct plot element.
    - "The 1970s ` Technological Aesthetic Constraint` is visually and functionally present in Burt's Pride's design and repair."
    -  "Potential for `Spectral Interaction` if a ghost witnessed something (though not a primary path here)."
  deontic_ modalities:
    - "The implied threat of GatorCorp ties into the `Automaton/LLM User Stigma ` (as they'd likely use such tech) and the power of the `Oligarchy of meat processors`."
     - "Granny's independence reflects the `Gun Ownership (Regional)` and self-reliance values outside Beetriot."
   axiological_modalities:
    - "`Alligator Meat` as a primary resource is central to Granny's livelihood ."
    - "The value of `Solar Power & Ingenuity` is shown through Burt's Pride."
     - The `Late 1970s Aesthetic` is a key design feature.
    - "Granny  might invoke `Deified Celebrities` in exclamations."
  epistemic_modalities:
     - "The true cause of Burt's Pride's disappearance is initially obscured, requiring investigation."
    - "`Sw amp Witch Lore` is implicated via the Vampire Bunnies."
    - "`Conspiracy` theories (Skeeter, ' Invisible Women') provide local color and potential misdirection."
  historical_and_temporal_coherence: The quest  occurs in the post-Calamity present, with technology and societal structures consistent with this era.
  synchronic _coherence: "The interaction of GE tech (Burt's Pride), retro-aesthetic (his panels/interface), and  supernatural elements (Vampire Bunnies) is central to the quest's conflict and resolution, fitting the world' s established blend. The economic backdrop of Lickskillet vs. GatorCorp is present."
  complexity_management: " The quest focuses on a core mystery (missing gator) but weaves in several distinct Primal Mama elements (GE gators, Vampire  Bunnies, 1970s tech, oligarchy) without becoming overwhelming. Each element serves the plot or provides flavor ."

final_note: |
  This quest aims to be a microcosm of Primal Mama, allowing the player to engage  with its core rules, aesthetics, and strange atmosphere in a narratively satisfying way.
