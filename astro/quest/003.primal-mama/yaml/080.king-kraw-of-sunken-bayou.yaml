title : "The King Kraw of Sunken Bayou"
location: "Sunken Bayou, South of Licksk illet"
suggested_level: "15-20 (Adapt based on specific creature stats)"
background : |
  Beau "Gator" Boudreaux, the ambitious but reckless son of Beetriot oligarch Cassian  Boudreaux, has ventured into the treacherous Sunken Bayou to hunt the legendary "King Kraw," a monstrously  large, possibly cybernetically enhanced GE Alligator. Cassian, or perhaps a concerned Lickskillet contact,  wants Beau found, preferably alive. Rumors in Lickskillet's *Gator Pit Bar* suggest Beau 's high-tech expedition met with disaster.
