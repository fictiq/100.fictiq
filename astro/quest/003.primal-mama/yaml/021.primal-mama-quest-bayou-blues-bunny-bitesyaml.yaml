introduction:
  title: "Weaving Narratives Within  a Coherent Heterocosm"
  description: |
    This document outlines quests designed for the Primal Mama  heterocosm. Each quest aims to be a functional narrative unit that operates within, and reinforces, the world's  established rules (modalities), entity properties, and socio-cultural dynamics. Quest design prioritizes internal logic, drawing directly  from the "Primal Mama Coherence & Internal Logic Protocol" (PM-CILP) to ensure consistency and  immersive believability.

    entity_type: "Person (Mom-and-Pop Alligator Farmer)"
    core_function_ purpose:
      primary_role: "Raises and harvests Genetically Engineered (GE) Alligators for meat, operating  a small-scale farm. # Auth: PM-CILP (Alligator Meat as primary protein)"

      Survival of  his farm, providing for his family, maintaining independence from the Oligarchy, deep suspicion of "unnatural" swamp happenings  beyond his GE gators.
    relevant_functional_properties:
      capability: "Basic GE Alligator husbandry (feeding,  pen maintenance, solar charging oversight via chunky 1970s-style monitoring equipment)."
      skill: " Decent shot with a lever-action rifle (common outside Beetriot)."
      limitation: "Lacks deep  esoteric/supernatural knowledge; financially vulnerable."
      vulnerability: "His gators are his livelihood; susceptible to  intimidation by the Oligarchy."

        entity_type: "Person (Swamp Witch)"
         core_function_purpose:

           limitation: "Her control over her creations may be imperfect or her concerns misaligned with \"normal\" folk;  reclusive. Prefers barter involving strange or \"spiritually resonant\" 1970s artifacts (e.g., a  specific 8-track tape, a mood ring that \"sings true\")."
          axiological_stance : "Values solitude, balance of the \"weird\" swamp, and unique artifacts over standard currency."
      - entity_id:  "CREATURE_VampBunny_Drainer_01"
        entity_name: "\"Spark- Sapper\" Vampire Bunny Variant"
        entity_type: "Creature (Supernatural/Biological)"
        core_function _purpose:
          primary_role: "To drain energy from GE Alligators' bio-batteries/solar  absorption systems, not for blood, but for the \"vital spark\" or refined energy within. # Auth: PM- CILP (Alethic: Vampire Bunny Propagation, Solar Dominance impacting alligator metabolism)"
        relevant_functional _properties:
          capability: "Stealthy approach; specialized bite that interfaces with and drains energy from GE All igator bio-electrical systems, leaving behind a faint, ozonic scent and subtle, iridescent residue."
          limitation: "Does  not directly kill gators, but weakens them significantly, preventing proper solar basking/energy storage."
          vulnerability: "Specific  herbal repellents known to Swamp Witches; perhaps aversion to certain sonic frequencies or concentrated solar bursts (if a device could be  made)."

  quest_overview_log_entry:
    title: "Quest Overview & Log Entry"
     initial: |
      "Jebediah Cletus, a gator farmer near Lickskillet , is in a bind. His prize GE solar-gators are sluggish, refusing to bask, and their energy levels are critically  low. He suspects "swamp hexes" or some new blight. Production is plummeting, and he's terrified  the Meat Oligarchy will use this as an excuse to run him outta business. He needs someone to figure out what' s wrong and fix it, fast. He's offered a fair few Crowns and maybe a "deluxe" wood -paneled gator-call clock he's been working on."
    mid_quest: |
       "The gators show strange, tiny puncture marks around their solar absorption panels and bio-battery ports. There's an  odd, faint ozonic smell and an iridescent residue. Tracks of unnaturally large rabbits lead away from the pens. These  ain't your garden-variety bunnies. Could this be the work of those "Vampire Bunnies" folks  whisper about? Might need to find someone who knows about such critters – maybe a Swamp Witch like Mama Mathilde."
    resolution _paths_preview: |
      "Mama Mathilde, the local Swamp Witch, admits the 'Spark-Sapper'  bunnies are her doing – a new batch that's a bit too effective at 'tasting the sun-juice'.  She might be convinced to help, for the right price or peculiar trade. Alternatively, she might offer a way to repel  them, if I can gather the strange ingredients for her 1970s-inspired 'Bunny B- Gone' device."

          - "Path B ( Crafting/Acquisition): Get a recipe/schematic from Mama Mathilde (or find one elsewhere if she' s uncooperative/killed) for a \"Spark-Sapper Repellent Device\" (1970s  aesthetic, requires specific swamp ingredients and some salvaged tech components like vacuum tubes and copper wiring). Craft and deploy the device( s) around Jeb's farm."

  codex_integration_coherence_notes:
     title: "Codex Integration & World Coherence Notes"
    notes:
      - "This quest directly utilizes and  reinforces the existence and unique properties of GE Alligators, Vampire Bunnies, and Swamp Witches as defined in PM- CILP."
      - "It highlights the socio-economic tension between mom-and-pop operations and the  Meat Oligarchy in the Lickskillet region."
      - "The 1970s tech aesthetic  is incorporated into potential solutions and quest-giver's equipment."
      - "It provides an opportunity to explore the  \"weird spiritual miasma\" of the swamp through interaction with Mama Mathilde and her creations."
      - "The reliance on solar  power (for gators) becomes a plot-relevant vulnerability."
      - "The quest avoids contradicting established alethic  rules (e.g., no one is eating beef)."
      - "It allows for player agency in choosing a  resolution path, reflecting different axiological approaches (diplomacy, ingenuity, aggression)."
