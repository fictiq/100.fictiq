    -  title: 'Forgotten Pre-Calamity Cache (Level 17)'
      log_entry: |
         We've pushed this far into the Gumbo Peninsula; might as well pick the bones clean. Word is,  old world stashes can still turn up a decent haul of usable tech and preserved goods. We'll follow the murky  shoreline south-east, aiming for the peninsula's gnarly tip. Watch out for aggressive Mud-Skipper Mut ants (Level 15) and packs of Feral Bayou Hounds (Level 15) that roam the  mangroves. Best give the high bluffs a wide berth – a particularly nasty, territorial Apex Gator-Hawk (Level  30) (some kind of rogue GE monstrosity) nests up there. At the peninsula's end, we 'll find the dilapidated 'Sunshine' Solar Relay Station, now overrun by chittering Swamp Skulkers (Level  17). Clear 'em out, climb the rusty relay tower. Third platform should have a reinforced salvage crate. 
      reward_hint: 'Valuable 1970s-aesthetic tech components, possibly a functional data -tape.'

    - title: "Schematic: Advanced 'Gator Getter' Electro-Machete ( Level 22)"
      log_entry: |
        From the Solar Relay Station, we'll head  south-west along the coast. There's a submerged culvert entrance near the waterline, almost hidden by dangling Spanish  moss. A grumpy Mutated Bayou Bruin (Level 16) has claimed the entrance – deal with it.  Inside, the tunnel system (pre-calamity drainage?) leads north, then west up some slick, algae-covered steps.  Follow the main conduit west until it forces a turn north. At the dead end, look for a narrow passage west,  down into a larger, echoing chamber. A hulking, ornate pre-calamity sarcophagus dominates the room –  disturbing it rouses a Restless Spirit (Level 23), likely the original occupant. Once it's pac ified (or dispersed), check the western wall for two rusted footlockers. One should contain the Schematic: Advanced ' Gator Getter' Electro-Machete. If you've kept your basic model tuned up, this'll  be a solid upgrade for pacifying unruly GE gators and other thick-hided threats.

    - title: 'Sunken Contraband (Level 19)'
       log_entry: |
        Another promising salvage ping, but it'll require some careful navigation. Head back to the ' Sunshine' Solar Relay Station. Follow the overgrown remains of a raised service causeway west. It'll curve north-west before hitting  a collapsed section. From there, pick a path north along the eastern shore of the peninsula. In a small, brack ish inlet, there's a half-flooded concrete recess. Guarded by a flock of territorial Shrieker Bats (Level  13) and a larger, more aggressive Alpha Skulker (Level 19). Neutralize the threats.  A waterlogged chest wedged in the recess holds the goods.
      reward_hint: 'Pre-calamity  medical supplies, possibly some refined solar cells.'

    - title: 'Scavenger Den (Level 17)'
       log_entry: |
        Backtrack to the causeway and follow it north until it peters out near  the shacks of Bayou's End. From there, best to hitch an airboat ride (or find a working  skiff) back to Lickskillet Docks. From the docks, head north-west out of Licksk illet proper. Just past a crumbling highway overpass (now a makeshift bridge), south-east of the main dirt track,  a flickering campfire marks a Scavenger Den. The local 'Rust Devil' Gang (Levels 14 & 17)  won't appreciate visitors. Clear them out and loot their main supply crate near the fire pit for anything useful they've 'acquired '.
      reward_hint: 'Ammunition, basic repair kits, maybe some moonshine.'

    -  title: 'Lair of the Bloated One (Level 21)'
      log_entry: |
         From the cleared Scavenger Den, head west towards the coast. Follow the treacherous coastline north-west for a good stretch . You'll need to deal with (or very carefully sneak past) a massive, territorial Feral GE 'Gatorzilla ' (Level 12 – looks old and scarred) and just about every pack of Howler Mutts (Level 15 ) on this stretch of coast. Eventually, near a series of collapsed pre-calamity concrete pipes, you' ll find a Bloated Mirefiend (Level 21) – a truly disgusting, immense amphibious mutation. Put  the abomination down. Its nest, within a wide pipeline section, should contain a sturdy, sealed container.
      reward_ hint: 'High-grade chemical components, possibly a rare biological sample.'

    - title: 'Reclaimed Outpost ( Level 13)'
      log_entry: |
        East from the Mirefiend's Lair, you 'll hit a barely passable raised roadway running north-south. Follow it north towards the skeletal remains of Arinbjorn Refinery . Take a branching, cracked asphalt path west from the refinery's perimeter. It leads to what the old maps call an  'Automated Pumping Station' – now an Abandoned Site. Though 'abandoned' ain't quite right. A  nasty band of Swamp Rats (armed squatters, Levels 12 & 13) have holed up there. Ev ict them, permanently. Clearing the place might encourage some more legitimate (and less hostile) folk to set up shop,  maybe even a traveling Junk Peddler.
      reward_for_liberation:
        - '170  Bayou Creds (or equivalent barter value)'
        - '50 Reputation Points with Lickskillet Settlers '

    - title: 'Relic of Solar Faith'
      log_entry: |
        From the  now-Reclaimed Outpost, head south-east towards the ghost town of Fornhala Bayou. It's more than  just a signpost on a rusted pole – the collapsed shacks and sinking structures still hide some decent salvage, some of  it surprisingly valuable. Pick through the ruins, then take the old logging trail south out of town. As you navigate the winding , overgrown levee path, look for a Forgotten Solar Shrine (dedicated to Burt Reynolds, perhaps?) on an isolated hummock to  the west. You'll need to make some tricky jumps across submerged debris to reach it. Drawing inspiration from the shrine 's lingering aura grants a moment of profound clarity (one free 'Insight' point).
      reward_hint: '1  Free Skill/Perk Point.'

    - title: "Schematic: 'Swamp Walker' Reinforced Waders  (Level 16)"
      log_entry: |
        Once you've paid respects at the Solar  Shrine, return to the levee path. Head west, circling below and around the shrine's hummock. North -west of the shrine, you should find a cave entrance, half-hidden by a curtain of kudzu. Inside , the air gets thick. You'll eventually stumble upon three aggressively territorial Feral Erpenthropes (Level  16) – looks like they've gone truly feral, lost their minds. Best put them out of their misery.  Loot the area east of their crude campfire for a chest. South of their campfire, near a pile of gnawed bones, another  chest contains the Schematic: 'Swamp Walker' Reinforced Waders. More containers with random salvage can be found further west and south in  their den.

    - title: 'Murky Waters,  Dark Secret (Level 19)'
      log_entry: |
        Return to Fornhala Bayou. Head  north-east from the ghost town to find a large, stagnant lagoon. No clear path – just pick your way carefully down the slick , muddy hillside. The lagoon itself is the hunting ground of a venomous Sky-Terror Cockatrice (Level 20)  (another GE escapee, by the looks of it). On the low hills north of the lagoon, there's signs  of a recent struggle – a Guarded Find. Take out the lurking Alpha Swamp Skulker (Level 19 ) that's picking over the remains. Loot a nearby corpse to find – among other things – a "Tattered  Journal Page." There's also a sealed NiftyLUNCH™ container next to the body.
      reward_ hint: 'Clues to another location/mystery, useful consumables.'

    - title: "Master Schematic: 'Sun  Blade' Electro-Machete (Level 32)"
      log_entry: |
        Head back  south to the lagoon. You'll need to cross it (find a shallow spot or a barely floating log) to reach  its eastern shore. Here, among the cypress knees, stands the shell of a ruined pre-calamity watchtower, near  another Guarded Find marker on your HUD. Give the heavily mutated 'Night Howler' Pack (Level 32) near  the main stash a wide berth for now. Slip into the crumbling watchtower. A reinforced chest inside holds the prize: Schematic : Masterwork 'Sun Blade' Electro-Machete. A true piece of high-tier, 1970 s-aesthetic lethality. That'll do for this run. There's one more ping to the south- east, by the lake's edge, but it's crawling with more of those Night Howlers.
