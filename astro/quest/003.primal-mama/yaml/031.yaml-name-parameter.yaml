introduction:
  title: A Tangled  Tail in the Bayou
  content: >
    This quest, "Gator Bait and Switch," is designed to  immerse the player
    in the unique socio-economic and technological landscape of Primal Mama,
    specifically the struggles  of mom-and-pop alligator operations against
    larger, more predatory entities within the retro-futuristic,
    bayou -infused setting of Lickskillet. It leverages established
    modalities (Alethic, Deontic , Axiological, Epistemic) to ensure
    coherence with the world's internal logic.

quest _overview:
  quest_giver: Maude "Mama" Clementine
  locations:
    - Clementine Gator  Farm (outskirts of Lickskillet)
    - Lickskillet Black Market (optional)
     - Old Man Tiber's Bayou Shack (optional)
  suggested_player_level: "5-8  (assuming a level progression system)"
  core_conflict: Economic sabotage and technological mystery.
  themes: Survival  of the small operator, technological obsolescence/idiosyncrasy, corporate greed, bayou ingenuity.
  summary: > 
    Maude Clementine's prize genetically engineered (GE) breeding alligator,
    "Burt Reynolds the  Second," has suddenly become lethargic and its
    solar-intake panels are malfunctioning, displaying bizarre error codes 
    on its 1970s-style diagnostic console. Maude suspects foul play by the
     encroaching Bayou Meat Packers Inc. (BMP Inc.), who have been trying
    to buy her out. The  player must investigate the malfunction, determine
    if it's sabotage or a genuine (if strange) technical failure,  and
    potentially find a way to fix Burt II.

quest_objectives_walkthrough:
  - objective_ title: Meet Maude Clementine
    trigger: >
      Player enters Lickskillet and hears rumors of Maude 's troubles,
      or approaches the Clementine Gator Farm directly.
    details: >
      Maude  is a weathered, resilient woman in her late 50s, fiercely
      protective of her small farm. She  explains the situation with Burt II,
      her prize solar-powered GE gator, and her suspicions of BMP Inc.
     dialogue_hooks:
      - "Danged ol' BMP Inc. thinks they can run us small folk outta  business, by Burt Reynolds' ghost, they got another thing comin'!"
      - "This newfangled  GE stuff is a blessing and a curse. Works like a charm 'til it don't, and then tryin ' to fix it with these old-timey readouts... it's enough to make a preacher cuss." 

  - objective_title: Investigate Burt Reynolds the Second
    details:
      summary: The player examines  the massive GE alligator.
      physical_check: Burt II is indeed lethargic, his scales dull.
       technological_check:
        # Original MD Key: Technological Check (1970s Aesthetic Constraint)
         description: >
          The main control panel on Burt II's harnessing rig is pure late 1970 s:
          chunky buttons, wood paneling, analog-style readouts (even for complex
          genetic  data). The error codes are cryptic (e.g., "ERROR 74-B: SOLAR FLUX CAP ACITANCE IMBALANCE - CHECK AUXILIARY SUN-SYNCHRONIZER").
        note_aesthetic_ constraint: "1970s Aesthetic Constraint applied"
      perception_skill_check:
        # Original MD  Key: Witcher Senses (or equivalent perception skill)
        findings:
          - "Detects an unusual, faint energy signature  from a specific access port on the solar panel array, hidden beneath a poorly-fitted faux-wood panel."
           - "May detect faint traces of unfamiliar swamp mud/residue near the panel, not typical of Maude's  farm."
    relevant_modalities:
      - "Alethic (Alligator Biogenesis): Burt II's  solar energy absorption capabilities are established."
      - "Alethic (Technological Aesthetic Constraint): The diagnostic console * must* conform."

  - objective_title: Diagnose the Malfunction
    details:
      summary: Opening  the suspect access port reveals the problem.
      discovery: >
        A small, modern-looking (i.e.,  NOT 1970s aesthetic) micro-regulator
        has been crudely spliced into the solar panel 's power distribution unit.
        It's clearly out of place and seems to be causing an overload or interference .
      knowledge_check:
        # Original MD Key: Knowledge Check (Technical Skill or Epistemic link) 
        description: >
          A player with technical skills, or access to someone with such knowledge,
          might  recognize the micro-regulator as a deliberate sabotage device,
          designed to look like a jury-rigged repair but actually  meant to disable.
          The 1970s console wouldn't be able to properly diagnose this foreign
          component , hence the cryptic errors.
    relevant_modalities:
      - "Alethic (Technological Aesthetic Constraint):  The foreign part violates this, making it stand out."
      - "Epistemic (Technical Knowledge): Specialized knowledge  is needed to understand the advanced biotech vs. retro-tech interface."

  - objective_title: "Find a Replacement Part  OR a Way to Bypass/Remove the Sabotage"
    path_a:
      title: "Replacement Part  (1970s Compliant)"
      details: Maude doesn't have a spare "Sun-Synchronizer"  module that the console *thinks* is faulty.
      leads:
        - >
          Ask around L ickskillet: A seedy tech-scrapper in the market might
          have old GE gator parts.  (Social interaction, potential bartering/cost).
        - >
          Old Man Tiber: A reclusive ex -bio-engineer living deep in the bayou,
          rumored to tinker with pre-calamity and  early post-calamity tech.
          Might have parts or knowledge. (Exploration, potential danger from
           swamp creatures/Swamp Witches).
    path_b:
      title: "Bypass/ Remove (Technical Skill)"
      details: >
        A skilled player might attempt to carefully remove the sabotaging
         micro-regulator and re-wire the original 1970s-style components.
      challenge : >
        Requires a good technical skill check. Failure could further damage
        Burt II or alert the sab oteurs. The 1970s components might be finicky.
    optional_complication:
       # Original MD Key: Optional Complication (Epistemic/Social)
      description: >
        If the  player uses an Automaton/LLM to diagnose or find info,
        they might suffer the "stain on their reputation"  if observed by
        Maude or other Lickskillet locals. Maude might comment, "Heard tell 
        them thinkin' machines ain't to be trusted, son. Hope you know what
        you' re doin'."
    relevant_modalities:
      - "Axiological (Autonomy vs. Automation)" #  No colon in value
      - "Deontic (Automaton/LLM User Stigma)" # No colon in  value

  - objective_title: "Confront the Evidence (Optional, leads to different outcomes)"
    details : >
      The foreign micro-regulator might have a barely visible manufacturer's
      mark, traceable to  a shell company for BMP Inc.
    investigation_paths:
      - Checking Lickskillet shipping manifests  (if accessible).
      - >
        Interrogating a disgruntled BMP Inc. employee (low-level,  perhaps
        found drinking his sorrows away).
      - >
        Consulting an Erpenthrope truth-seeker (if  the player has such a
        contact) who might have observed BMP Inc.'s covert activities.
        (Interaction  with unique entity type).
    relevant_modalities:
      - "Epistemic (Erpenthrope  Knowledge)" # No colon in value
      - "Deontic (Friction from meat oligarchy)" # No colon in value 

  - objective_title: Repair Burt Reynolds the Second
    details: Install the replacement part or successfully complete the bypass.
     outcome: >
      Burt II's solar panels hum back to life, his eyes brighten, and he lets
       out a (relatively) contented bellow. The 1970s console now shows
      "SYSTEM NOMINAL  - ALL HAIL BURT!" (a little custom Easter egg Maude programmed).

  - objective_title: Report to Ma ude Clementine
    details: Maude is overjoyed.
    player_choices_consequences:
      -  choice: "Just fix it, no accusations"
        consequence: Maude is grateful, pays a modest reward . She remains wary.
      - choice: "Present evidence of BMP Inc. sabotage - Weak evidence"
        consequence:  >
          Maude is scared, pays a slightly better reward but urges caution.
          BMP Inc. might send goons to  intimidate Maude or the player later.
      - choice: "Present evidence of BMP Inc. sabotage - Strong evidence  (player makes it public)"
        consequence: >
          Maude is emboldened. Lickskillet might rally  (briefly) against
          BMP Inc. BMP Inc. retaliates more severely – perhaps a direct attack
          on the  farm, or attempts to discredit the player. This could lead
          to a follow-up quest.
      - choice:  "Present evidence of BMP Inc. sabotage - Strong evidence (player advises Maude to use it carefully)"
        con sequence: >
          Maude uses the info as leverage, gaining a temporary reprieve from
          BMP Inc. harassment . Player gets a good reward.
    relevant_modalities:
      - "Axiological (Autonomy, Independence)"  # No colon in value
      - "Deontic (Cattle Consumption Prohibition) indirectly – Maude might say , \"Least it ain't like we're tryin' to eat no damn cow, that'd bring  the real fire down on us!\""

world_coherence_notes:
  alethic_modalities:
    - "The entire premise  relies on `Alligator Biogenesis` and `Solar Dominance`."
    - "The `Technological Aesthetic  Constraint` is central to the mystery and diagnostic challenge."
    - "The potential involvement of an Erpenthrope  (`Erpenthropic Transformation` and their truth-seeking nature) provides an optional layer."
  deontic _modalities:
    - "The \"friction\" from the `meat processor oligarchy` (BMP Inc.) is the  primary antagonistic force."
    - "The `Automaton/LLM User Stigma` can be a minor social  consequence for the player."
    - "This quest avoids the `Cattle Consumption Prohibition` directly but exists within its societal  shadow (alligator meat is the norm)."
  axiological_modalities:
    - "`Alligator Meat`  (and by extension, healthy GE gators) is highly valued."
    - "The `Late 19 70s Aesthetic` for tech is a key cultural and diagnostic element."
    - "`Autonomy vs. Automation ` is touched upon with the Automaton/LLM stigma."
    - "Maude's farm embodies values of `independence ` and `self-reliance`."
    - "The naming of Burt Reynolds the Second reflects `Deified Celebrities` ."
  epistemic_modalities:
    - "`Technical Knowledge` (or lack thereof regarding the mixed  tech) is crucial."
    - "`Erpenthrope Knowledge` (via Silas) can offer hidden insights." 
    - "The \"official narrative\" of a simple malfunction could be challenged by the player's findings, echoing the broader theme  of `obscured truths` in Primal Mama."
  historical_temporal_coherence:
    - " The reliance on GE alligators is a direct result of the `post-biological calamity` state."
    - " The 1970s tech aesthetic is a `consistent historical layer` affecting current technology."
  synchronic _coherence:
    - "The quest demonstrates the `Entity Properties vs. World Laws` (GE gators function by  solar power but are diagnosed via retro tech)."
    - "Maude's actions (seeking help) are plausible  given her `resources and social standing` against the oligarchy."
    - "The `coexistence of advanced biotech and limited computational /digital tech` (implied by 1970s aesthetic and LLM stigma) is a core challenge ."
