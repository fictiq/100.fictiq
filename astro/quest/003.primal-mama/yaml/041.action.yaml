quest_snapshot:
  type: Side Quest / Investigation / Problem-Solving
  suggested_level:  5-8
  locations: "Lickskillet outskirts, a derelict pre-calamity electronics dump , potentially a secluded Erpenthrope's den or Swamp Witch's hovel."
  quest_giver: " Mama Gator (Esmeralda Thibodeaux), a weathered but resilient mom-and-pop GE alligator rancher in  Lickskillet."
  prerequisite_quests: "None (though general familiarity with Lickskillet and  its reliance on gator ranching is helpful)."
  anticipated_rewards:
    - "Decent sum of Crowns  (currency of Primal Mama)."
    - "Increased reputation with Lickskillet's independent ranchers."
     - "A unique, salvaged 1970s-aesthetic component (potentially useful for crafting or a minor  stat boost)."
    - "Perhaps a discount on Mama Gator's prime alligator steaks or a rare alligator-hide  crafting material."
    - XP.
  quest_summary: |
    Mama Gator's prize new " SunSinker Mark II" breeding alligator, "Big Jerry" (named in reverence of Jerry Reed), is behaving erratically.  Its advanced solar absorption panels are causing its 1970s-era control interface to fry, and it's refusing  to bask or feed. If Big Jerry dies, Mama Gator's small operation is ruined. She needs someone to figure out  what’s wrong – be it technical, sabotage, or something stranger – and fix it within the world's technological and aesthetic constraints .

coherence_integration:
  description: "This quest aims to explore several core tenets of Primal Mama:"
   modalities:
    - type: Alethic Modalities
      points:
        - The capabilities and reliance on  GE Solar Alligators.
        - "The absolute constraint of the late 1970s technological aesthetic,  even for advanced systems."
        - "Potential interaction with Erpenthropes or Swamp Witches if the problem  transcends simple mechanics, touching on the 'strangely spiritual miasma.'"
    - type: Deontic Modalities
       points:
        - "The economic pressures on mom-and-pop operations in Lickskillet, potentially hinting at  friction with meat processor oligarchies (who might be interested in the SunSinker tech or Mama Gator's failure)."
        -  "The social stigma of Automaton/LLM users might be subtly reinforced if a character eschews them for 'hands-on'  70s tech solutions."
    - type: Axiological Modalities
      points:
        - The value of  solar power and genetic ingenuity.
        - The ingrained cultural preference for the 1970s aesthetic.
        - The  importance of alligator meat to the local economy.
        - "The reverence for deified celebrities (Big Jerry's name )."
    - type: Epistemic Modalities
      points:
        - The specialized knowledge required for GE  Alligator maintenance under aesthetic constraints.
        - "The potential for folk knowledge (Swamp Witch/Erpenthrope)  to offer solutions where conventional tech fails or misunderstands."

quest_stages:
  - stage:
    title: Gator Got the Jitters
    trigger: Player  character enters Lickskillet outskirts and either overhears distressed ranchers or is approached by a worried local who directs them to  Mama Gator.
    description: |
      Mama Gator explains that "Big Jerry," her prized SunSinker Mark  II GE Alligator, is acting strangely – thrashing, refusing to bask, and its 1970s- style pen monitoring console is sparking and giving nonsensical readings. She fears for its life and her livelihood.
    objectives: 
      - Talk to Mama Gator about Big Jerry's condition.
      - "Examine Big Jerry and its  enclosure. (Player uses 'Witcher Senses' or equivalent to note the sparking 70s control panel, the  gator's distress, and perhaps an unusual ozone smell or faint hum)."
      - "Report findings to Mama  Gator. (She suggests finding 'Sparky' Fitzwilliam, an eccentric old tech-head who lives in a cluttered workshop  made of salvaged pre-calamity Airstream trailers on the edge of the swamp. She warns he's  wary of folks who rely too much on 'newfangled Automatons.')"
  - stage:
    title : Sparky's Static Shock Diagnosis
    trigger: Player locates Sparky Fitzwilliam.
    description: | 
      Sparky, amidst a chaotic yet organized collection of 1970s electronics, initially grumbles about being  disturbed. If the player avoids mentioning LLMs or shows appreciation for "real tech," he becomes more amiable. He agrees  to look at Big Jerry, intrigued by the "SunSinker Mark II" designation.
    objectives:
       - Find Sparky Fitzwilliam's workshop.
      - Convince Sparky to help Mama Gator.
       - "Escort/Follow Sparky to Mama Gator's ranch. (Optional: Protect Sparky from minor swamp threats if  his workshop is remote)."
      - "Observe Sparky's examination of Big Jerry. (Sparky, using  chunky diagnostic tools that look like they belong on the set of a 70s sci-fi show, determines the advanced  solar intake is overloading the 'Mark I Solar Influx Regulator,' a key 70s-style interface component. It needs  a rare, more robust vintage part to handle the 'juice,' or a custom modification that still *looks* period-appropriate)."
   - stage:
    title: The Groovetron Hunt OR Bayou Resonance
    description: This stage branches  based on Sparky's findings and player choices.
    paths:
      - id: Path A
        title:  "Technical Fault – 'The Groovetron Hunt'"
        trigger: "Sparky identifies a specific rare 197 0s-style component needed (e.g., a 'Cryo-Stabilized Groovetron Capacitor' or a ' MaxiWatt Harmonizing Inductor')."
        description: |
          Sparky knows the part is almost impossible  to find but recalls seeing something similar in schematics for luxury tech from before the calamity. He suggests checking a nearby derel ict electronics dump – a hazardous area rumored to still have some pre-calamity tech intact, albeit patrolled by malfunctioning  security bots or desperate scavengers.
        objectives:
          - "Travel to the Old [Location Name]  Electronics Dump."
          - "Search the dump for a functional [Rare Component Name]. (This might involve bypassing/dis abling old security systems, fighting off rival scavengers, or solving a simple environmental puzzle to access a sealed container, all while maintaining  the 70s tech interaction theme – e.g., overriding a lock with a bulky punch-card)."
          - " Return the [Rare Component Name] to Sparky."
      - id: Path B
        title: "Beyond  The Technical – 'Bayou Resonance'"
        trigger: "Sparky declares the interface, while stressed, *should* be  handling the load, or his initial fix (if a simpler component was tried first) doesn't solve the erratic behavior. He mut ters something about 'bad frequencies' or 'unsettled currents,' suggesting the problem might be outside his expertise and recommends  someone who 'listens to the swamp's whispers.'"
        description: |
          Mama Gator, desperate,  suggests consulting either a reclusive Erpenthrope sage known for understanding the "deep truths" of the bayou' s creatures, or a Swamp Witch reputed to deal with "unseen agitations."
        options:
          -  id: Option B1
            title: "Consult an Erpenthrope (Silas Scale-Truth)."
             objectives:
              - "Find Silas Scale-Truth's hidden den in the [Swamp Region].  (May require tracking or solving a simple riddle given by Mama Gator)."
              - "Convince Silas to help.  (Silas, being a truth-seeker, might require an offering of a 'truthful story' or a rare , untainted piece of pre-calamity data – perhaps found in the electronics dump from Path A)."
               - "Listen to Silas's diagnosis. (He senses an 'unnatural, high-pitched thrumming' near Big Jerry , a resonance invisible to normal senses, possibly from a hidden device)."
              - "Return to Big Jerry's  pen and use a (70s-style) directional antenna provided by Silas to locate and disable the hidden resonator device. (The  device could be modern tech crudely disguised with 70s casing, planted by oligarchy rivals)."
          - id:  Option B2
            title: "Consult a Swamp Witch (Auntie Morass)."
            objectives: 
              - "Find Auntie Morass's stilt-hut deep in the [Murky Bayou location]. (Lik ely guarded by strange swamp flora/fauna, or requires navigating a confusing path)."
              - "Gain Auntie Morass' s favor. (She might demand a peculiar service or a gift – perhaps three 'perfectly silent' Vampire Bunny pel ts, or a Ghost-touched relic)."
              - "Gather ingredients for Auntie Morass's ' Solar Soothing Poultice.' (e.g., Moon-Charged Cypress Bark, Whispering Reeds, Ground  Spectral Loam)."
              - "Witness Auntie Morass perform a ritual to calm Big Jerry. (This involves applying the  poultice and chanting in a Cthulhu-goth-Southern patois)."
  - stage: 
    title: SunSinker Serenity
    trigger: The chosen solution (technical or esoteric) is implemented.
     description: |
      Big Jerry calms down. Its pen monitoring console stabilizes (with chunky, satisfying clicks and blinking  lights). The gator begins to bask under the sun, its solar panels glowing with a healthy, regulated energy.
    object ives:
      - Report the success to Mama Gator.
      - "Collect your reward from Mama Gator. (She' s overjoyed and pays generously. Sparky might also give the player a salvaged 70s gadget he 'souped up.'  Silas might offer a cryptic piece of wisdom. Auntie Morass might gift a minor protective charm)."

design_notes _and_complications:
  - topic: Atmosphere
    note: "Emphasize the bayou setting – murky  waters, strange sounds, humidity. The 70s tech should be tactile and audibly satisfying (clunky buttons,  whirring fans, buzzing neon)."
  - topic: Oligarchy Subplot
    note: "The hidden  resonator device (Path B1) could be a direct plant by a meat oligarchy trying to sabotage independent SunSinker research . This could lead to follow-up quests."
  - topic: Player Choice
    note: "The branching  path (Technical vs. Esoteric) allows for different playstyles. A purely technical solution might miss a deeper issue, or an esoteric  solution might be a temporary fix if there's an underlying technical flaw. The 'best' solution might involve elements of  both."
  - topic: 70s Aesthetic Enforcement
    note: "Any tools used by the player to  fix/disable things should ideally have a 70s design. If a modern tool is conceptually needed (like a frequency  scanner), it should be presented as a bulky, analog-dial device."
  - topic: Deity Reference
    note:  "Big Jerry being named after Jerry Reed is a small touch, but reinforces the world's unique spiritualism. Perhaps  Mama Gator hums a Jerry Reed tune when she's happy."
  - topic: Vampire Bunnies
    note : "If Auntie Morass is chosen, this provides a natural way to integrate the vampire bunnies, even if only as  a minor ingredient."
  - topic: "Death by Burger Context" # Quoted because of the colon in the key 
    note: "Though not central, the focus on alligator meat implicitly reinforces the cattle taboo. Mama Gator might make an  off-hand comment about 'thank goodness we don't have to rely on that cursed cow flesh.'"
