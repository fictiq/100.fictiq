  meta_objective: "The quest 'The Patriarch''s Skinner ' requires us to reach the swamps near Mudflat Town. While its location along the murky eastern bayou channels seems to  give us a great excuse to explore our way there on the airboat, the simple fact of the matter is that many  of the salvage markers and rumored hostile zones we'd normally clear along the way involve us dealing with Apex Gators or Olig archy Enforcers who are quite a few power-levels above our current gear. The Bayou Delta, however, is  a sprawling network of waterways, so perhaps it's time to turn our attention to the open water? There are, after all,  plenty of salvage markers that aren't on solid ground, often remnants from before or just after the Calamity."

        - 'You know how this works by now: three submerged, tethered crates.  Dive down and score the easy loot.'
        - 'There are some territorial Mutated Gar (Level 13 ) below the surface, their eyes glowing faintly, but they can be dispatched with a few well-aimed shots from  your underwater speargun (or by luring them close to the surface and whacking them).'
        - 'There are several  similar salvage points to the north – the entire Bayou Delta must just be littered with forgotten stashes from optimistic post-C alamity entrepreneurs.'

      note: 'Mutated Gar are easy enough to kill  if you can get a clean shot. They don''t do massive damage individually, but they''re more of a nuisance, as  they''ll latch onto the pontoons of your airboat and try to rip chunks off. A swarm of hungry Gar  is more than capable of sinking your ride if you''re not careful with that 1970s-era  hull plating.'

         - 'On this small, almost-island, you''ll find some Desperate Poachers (Level 15 ), probably trying to snag some undersized gators from the Saurian Sanctuary''s periphery.'
        - 'Deal with them  (they’re probably just hungry, but business is business).'
        - 'Loot their makeshift campsite where,  in a water-damaged tackle box, you''ll find the "Tattered Journal of a Bayou Scavenger,  Part II" and "Burt''s Lucky Fishing Lure" (a garish, feathered thing, but rumored to be  blessed by the Man Himself).'
        - 'Picking these up begins the quest "A Cherished Charm," normally started  by finding a faded flyer in the settlement of Crawdad Gulch, far to the south. Getting the lure directly just  skipped an inconsequential fetch.'

         - 'Talk to him and confirm your willingness to help him (for a cut, of course), then follow him north  along the western bank.'
        - 'Once you arrive at a particularly murky stretch of water, Slim Jimbo will deliver  the news that *you''re* the one who is going to have to dive into the muck and exhaustively search for  the elusive Luminous Bayou Pearl.'

      actions:
        - ' Head into the floating cantina near the notice board (it''s an old converted houseboat with surprisingly funky lighting), where  you''ll be accosted by some uppity locals with a low opinion of "Mainlanders" or anyone not smelling  permanently of gator musk.'
        - 'Another local, Old Man Tiber, a grizzled Erpenthrope with  eyes that have seen too many flood seasons, will defuse the situation with a quiet word. He''ll then offer to talk about  the contract.'
        - 'Indulge him, and he''ll tell you about their troubles. Mysterious energy  drains, a vital Solar Relay Tower going offline, flickering lights, and whispers of Miasma Phantoms... typical stuff for a  capable Fixer.'
        - 'Haggle for more Gator Chunks (or not, if you respect your elders)  then accept the quest.'
        - 'Before you leave, be sure to talk to the Cantina Keeper. He  not only plays Swamp Snap but sells some rare pieces: the "Gram Parsons ''Drifter'' Token" (Functions like a Spy,  low value but lets you draw), the "Burt Reynolds ''Bandit'' Token" (High strength, Close Combat, Muster  ability), the "Jerry Reed ''Hauler'' Token" (Medium strength, Close Combat, Muster ability), and a  generic "Swamp Witch ''Familiar'' Token" (Decent strength).'
        - 'Return north. You  can either pilot your airboat to the northernmost of the three swamp hummocks north of Mudflat Town, or do your best to  navigate treacherous, half-submerged boardwalks that used to connect these islets.'
        - 'Dock the airboat on a rick ety jetty along the southern end of the island where Solar Relay 7 stands, then head north along a muddy, overgrown  path.'
        - 'You''ll shortly reach the strange, shimmering Miasma and comment on its obviously unnatural, possibly  Calamity-linked, nature.'
        - 'Head into the Miasma and fight off some Miasma Ph antoms (Level 15, spectral figures that flicker like bad TV reception) when they appear, continuing north as you  do so.'
        - 'There are two hazmat-suited bodies you can investigate on the path, but their  old datalogs are corrupted beyond recovery.'
        - 'Make your way north until you find a pre-fab  utility shack (utilitarian 70s design, faded paint) east of the path and knock on the door ( it’s metal and probably loud).'
        - 'Silas, the nervous Solar Relay Technician, will open the door , eyes wide with fear. He''ll tell you what little he knows (mostly panicked babbling about flickering lights and cold spots ) before giving you a heavy brass key to the Relay Tower.'
        - 'Continue north along the path and deeper  into the Miasma, where you''ll have to fend off another pair of Miasma Phantoms (Level 15 ).'
        - 'A short distance later you''ll find the "Solar Relay Tower 7" signpost,  a short distance away from the actual towering structure (a lattice of metal and solar panels, humming ominously).'
        - 'Head  across a swaying metal catwalk and up some external stairs to enter the Relay Tower''s control room.'

        - 'Read it to find out about Silas''s dark secret – he cut corners on safety protocols, maybe  even rerouted power unsafely to impress a Swamp Witch he was sweet on, leading to an overload that fried a  predecessor and attracted… *something*.'
        - 'Be sure to have some Echo-Repellent Grease applied to your primary  weapon (or just trust in your Erpenthrope resilience if you are one), then return to Silas''s shack and talk to  the dishonest relay operator.'
        - 'He''ll make up an award-winningly lame excuse involving "rog ue solar flares" and "unshielded wiring," then try to cower out of doing the right thing.'
         - 'You’ll have to convince him to go (maybe with a reminder of what Burt Reynolds would do, or a threat  involving his favorite CB radio).'
        - 'As Silas predicted (or perhaps, as his guilt manifested), the Sorrow ful Echo (a powerful, tormented ghost, crackling with energy) shows up and attacks.'
        - 'You decide  to hold the Echo''s attention while Silas goes to reset the primary breakers and re-align the solar collectors, giving  him some good incentive (like "do it or I let this thing have you!").'
        - 'The Sorrow ful Echo is highly resistant to damage at first, its form flickering wildly. Just use your defensive maneuvers (and maybe a sw ig of whatever passes for a Quen potion in this world – "Gator-Hide Brew"?), and try to stay away from  its energy discharges.'
        - 'Once in a while, it''ll dissipate and summon a quartet of lesser Miasma  Phantoms (Level 15) which you can dispatch.'

        - 'Then , engage the Sorrowful Echo, which now fights more like a standard, albeit very angry, Miasma Phantom ( its energy shield disrupted by the restored power grid).'
        - 'Once it''s banished (dissipating with a final,  mournful wail), loot its fading energies for "The ''Heartwrencher'' Power Wrench" (a massive industrial  tool, surprisingly well-balanced) and some valuable Ectoplasmic Residue.'
        - 'After you claim your prize,  Silas will come to check on the situation. Decide whether to let him stay around (under strict supervision) or force him to leave  the island (and report his negligence).'
