 I_Quest_Overview_Hook:
  Quest_Name: Voodoo Vinyl
  Location_s:
    -  "Lickskillet (primarily)"
    - surrounding Bayou
    - "Mama Legba's Shack" 
  Quest_Giver: "Juke Jolene, a struggling musician and alligator skinner in Lickskillet."
   Prerequisites: "Player has established some presence in Lickskillet or is known for taking odd jobs."
   Summary: |-
    Juke Jolene believes her prized possession, a rare pre-Calamity Gram Parsons tribute LP,  has become cursed ("voodoo'd"). Playing it on her vintage (late 1970s aesthetic) hi-fi  system now brings bad luck, unsettling visions, and attracts agitated vampire bunnies. She needs the player to find out what' s wrong and fix it, fearing the "bad juju" will ruin her chances at the upcoming Lickskillet  Gator Gras talent show.
  Core_Gameplay_Loop: "Investigation, Exploration (Swamp), NPC Interaction, Item Collection,  Minor Combat (potentially), Puzzle-Solving (ritual-based)."
  Themes: "The persistence of the past, superstition  vs. strange realities, the intersection of retro-tech and bayou spiritualism."

II_Quest_Context_ Coherence_Alignment:
  Introduction: "This quest aims to leverage several core tenets of Primal Mama's  internal logic:"
  Tenets:
    - Title: "Technological Aesthetic Constraint"
      Description: |- 
        The LP and hi-fi system are central. Any interaction with them, or solutions involving them, must adhere to the late  1970s design aesthetic. The "curse" itself might even be tied to the nature of this analog technology in  a post-calamity world.
    - Title: "Spectral Interaction & Swamp Witch Lore"
      Description: |- 
        The solution likely involves seeking out a Swamp Witch (Mama Legba) who possesses the esoteric knowledge to diagnose and  treat such "voodoo." Ghosts or spiritual echoes might be involved with the LP's curse.
    - Title: "V ampire Bunny Propagation"
      Description: |-
        The agitated vampire bunnies serve as a tangible, if bizarre, manifestation of  the LP's negative influence, directly tying into authenticated world elements.
    - Title: "Deified Celebrities (Gram Parsons )"
      Description: |-
        The LP being a tribute to Gram Parsons provides a cultural touchstone and a reason  for Jolene's attachment to it, linking to the world's unique axiological values.
    - Title : "Bayou-Infused Miasma"
      Description: |-
        The quest takes place in the  swampy, atmospheric Lickskillet and surrounding bayou, reinforcing the world's core environmental feel. The " voodoo" itself is part of this miasma.
    - Title: "Alethic Modalities"
       Rules:
        - "The curse on the vinyl is treated as a real phenomenon within the world's rules ."
        - "Swamp Witch magic is a real, effective force."
        - "Vampire bunnies ' attraction to the cursed object is a consistent biological/supernatural reaction."
    - Title: "Epistemic  Modalities"
      Rules:
        - "Jolene *believes* it's cursed."
        - " Mama Legba *knows* how to deal with such curses (specialized knowledge)."
        - "The player  must gather knowledge from NPCs and the environment."

III_Quest_Flow_Key_Encounters:
  - Step : 1
    Title: "The Hook (Lickskillet - Juke Jolene's Shack)"
     Details:
      - |-
        Player finds Juke Jolene distraught. Her shack shows minor signs of bad luck (sp illed gator stew, a flickering vacuum-tube lamp in her 1970s style amplifier).
       - |-
        Jolene explains the problem with her "Gram's Groove" LP. When she plays it , her prized Solar-Charged Gator-Jaw Banjo goes out of tune, strange whispers are heard, and vampire bunnies have been scratching  at her door more aggressively.
      - |-
        She tasks the player with finding help, suggesting Mama Legba , a reclusive Swamp Witch. She provides a crude map or general directions.
  - Step: 2
    Title : "Seeking Mama Legba (Bayou Exploration)"
    Details:
      - Player navigates the bayou.
       - Potential_Encounters:
          - "Ambient GE Alligators (non-hostile unless provoked, part of the solar- powered ecosystem)."
          - "Natural swamp hazards (quicksand, disorienting fog – purely environmental)."
           - "A small pack of agitated Vampire Bunnies drawn by a faint echo of the LP's curse the player might be carrying  (e.g., Jolene gave a sleeve or a piece of lint from the record)."
      - |-
        Mama Leg ba's shack: A dilapidated but strangely clean structure, adorned with repurposed 1970s tech (e .g., old TV antennas as ritual focuses, a CB radio that crackles with spirit voices).
  - Step : 3
    Title: "The Diagnosis (Mama Legba's Shack)"
    Details:
       - |-
        Mama Legba is initially wary. Player must convince her of their sincerity (dialogue challenge, or  perhaps a small offering – a rare 8-track, a functional solar-powered trinket).
      - |- 
        She examines the LP (if the player brought it) or listens to the player's description.
       - |-
        Authentication: Mama Legba uses her own 1970s-style diagnostic tools (perhaps an  oscilloscope that visualizes spiritual disturbances, or by playing a snippet on her own enchanted turntable).
      - |-
        She  determines the LP isn't cursed in a traditional malevolent sense, but rather has an "emotional echo" or a "crossed spirit " clinging to it – perhaps a musician who died before their magnum opus (the tribute) could be heard, or whose own  music was stolen and incorporated into this tribute. This spirit's frustration is causing the disturbances.
  - Step:  4
    Title: "The Ritual Components (Item Collection)"
    Details:
      - |-
        Mama Leg ba requires specific items for a "Spirit Soothing" or "Echo Release" ritual:
      - Ritual_Components :
          - Item: "1x Whispering Reed"
            Location: "Found only in the \"Silent Shallows,\"  a part of the bayou where sound is mysteriously dampened (potential for eerie exploration, maybe a minor ghost encounter providing lore  about the area)."
          - Item: "3x Lumps of Purified Solar-Gator Fat"
             Location: "Harvested from GE Alligators (requires careful skinning/harvesting, or purchasing from a specific , perhaps shady, Lickskillet vendor). This ties into the GE gator tech and their solar nature – the  fat must be from a \"sun-basked\" gator."
          - Item: "1x Pre- Calamity Audio-Capacitor (Functional)"
            Location: "Salvaged from derelict 19 70s tech found in a forgotten pre-Calamity dump site or a small, submerged ruin in the bayou.  The capacitor must still hold a \"ghost of a charge.\" (Reinforces tech aesthetic and scarcity)."
  - Step : 5
    Title: "The Cleansing Ritual (Mama Legba's Shack)"
    Details:
       - Player returns with components.
      - |-
        Mama Legba sets up the ritual, incorporating the components with her  1970s tech-infused magical apparatus.
      - Player_Interaction:
          Introduction: "The  player might need to perform specific actions:"
          Actions:
            - "Tune a modified shortwave radio (1 970s aesthetic) to a specific \"spirit frequency.\""
            - "Place the LP on Mama Legba 's ritual turntable at the right moment."
            - "Perhaps protect Mama Legba from a final surge of agitated  vampire bunnies or minor spectral manifestations drawn by the ritual."
      - |-
        The ritual culminates in the spirit either being peacefully released  or its sorrowful echo being harmonized, cleansing the LP.
  - Step: 6
    Title: "Resolution &  Reward (Lickskillet - Juke Jolene's Shack)"
    Details:
      - Player returns  the cleansed LP to Jolene.
      - |-
        Jolene plays it; the music is clear,  the bad luck gone, no more agitated bunnies.
      - Rewards_List_Title: "Rewards:"
         Rewards:
          - "A decent sum of Alligator Scrip."
          - "A unique 1970 s-style weapon mod (e.g., \"Jolene's Lucky Guitar Pick\" – a melee weapon  charm) or a custom-painted gun stock with a Gram Parsons motif."
          - Increased reputation in Lickskillet.
           - "Mama Legba might offer to trade rare alchemical ingredients or teach the player a minor, thematically appropriate ritual ( e.g., how to temporarily soothe agitated swamp critters)."
      - Possible_Complication_Follow_up:  "If the spirit was particularly strong, a fragment might still linger, leading to a future minor quest or a unique encounter  later."

        Authentication: "Implied by physical nature of LPs; Potential consequence hinted at by  Mama Legba if player suggests destruction."
        Narrative_Function: "Offers a \"bad\" or \"sub optimal\" solution with minor negative feedback."
    Costs_Dependencies_Operational_Constraints:
      - Constraint_ID: OP CON-VV-01
        Applies_To: "FUNC-VV-01 (Sonic Resonance Disturbance), FUNC -VV-03 (Critter Agitator - intensified)"
        Description: "The most potent disruptive effects  (auditory disturbances, stronger critter agitation) are only manifested when the LP is actively being played on a compatible ( late 1970s aesthetic) record player."
        Authentication: "Jolene's experience;  Player observation."
        Narrative_Function: "Limits the constant impact of the curse, making it more of an event- based problem tied to its use."
      - Constraint_ID: DEPEND-VV-01
        Applies _To: "Its entire \"cursed\" state."
        Description: "Its anomalous properties are dependent on the anchored spiritual echo . Removing or soothing this echo neutralizes the \"curse.\""

        Narrative_Function: "Defines the core problem and the key to its solution ."
  Functional_Profile_Summary_Narrative_Role:
    Core_Functional_Identity: "The  \"Voodoo Vinyl\" (Gram's Groove LP) functions as a focal point for a lingering pre-Calam ity spiritual echo, whose frustration or sorrow subtly warps reality around it, particularly when its musical medium is activated. It is not  actively malevolent but a source of persistent, low-grade negative influence and a magnet for specific supernatural critters."
    Key _Narrative_Functions_Served: "McGuffin for the \"Voodoo Vinyl\" quest. Catalyst for exploring Licksk illet's culture, the bayou, and Swamp Witch lore. Embodies themes of the past's influence and the strange blend  of retro-tech and spirituality."
    Relationship_to_Alethic_Modality: "Its \"cursed\" state  is an authenticated possibility within Primal Mama's rules governing spiritual echoes and their interaction with physical objects, especially those with strong emotional or  historical connections. The 1970s tech itself is not inherently magical, but can become a conduit."
     Key_Functional_Tensions_Trade_offs: "Jolene's love for the music vs. the negative  effects it brings. The desire to preserve a pre-Calamity artifact vs. the need to resolve its spiritual imbalance . The risk of simple destruction (releasing negative energy) vs. the effort of ritual cleansing."
