  - Reclaimed_Shrine:
      title: "Re claimed Shrine (Abandoned Site Re-imagined)"
      narrative: |
        Leave your stilt-house  on the bayou's edge and follow the main elevated boardwalk east until you find a "Forgotten Shrine" marker on your  HUD's chunky, amber display. Forgotten, presumably, because of the aggressive Feral Swamp Crawlers (mutated,  semi-bipedal crustaceans) scuttling around. Exterminate them with your trusty Gator-Prod and some well-aimed  shots from your rivet gun. Soon, some grateful Bayou Settlers will return to their makeshift shrine, dedicated to a lesser Swamp  Spirit (or perhaps a fuzzy image of Jerry Reed).

      notes: |
        Crafting a Swamp Gas Bomb will add two of the devices to your  inventory – the most you can carry.
        Used bombs are automatically refilled when you rest at a safe campfire by consuming  "Swamp Shine" (potent, locally distilled alcohol) from your inventory.

  - Relic_of_ the_Deified:
      title: "Relic of the Deified (Place of Power Re-imagined )"
      narrative: |
        Before we get to those Mutant Nests – and believe me, we will – head south -west of the now bustling Reclaimed Shrine. You'll shortly come across another glowing Relic of the Deified (perhaps  a strangely preserved 8-track tape of Gram Parsons, humming with faint energy), which is guarded by a Level 6 Alpha  Bull Gator (a particularly large and aggressive GE Alligator).
      encounter:
        creature: "Level 6 Alpha Bull  Gator"
        description: "Bio-engineered behemoth, predictable charging attacks."
        strategy: "Use ' Kinetic Dampener' belt buckle (Quen equivalent) to absorb hits. Use Heavy Melee Slam with modded pipe wrench and  dodge-roll."
      interaction:
        item: "Relic of the Deified"
        action: "Interface by  placing hand on its oddly warm surface."
        reward: "Extra Insight Point (Ability Point equivalent)."

  - Mutant _Nests_Part1:
      title: "Mutant Nests"
      introduction: |
        There are  two Feral Erpenthrope Dens (Monster Nests re-imagined, where devolved, bestial Erpenthropes  or other nasty swamp mutants breed) we can destroy now. By doing so, we can consider the north-eastern stretch of  this bayou sector more or less pacified.
      dens_to_destroy:
        - location_description: "Near  the Relic of the Deified by the old, rusted-out battle tank remnants."
          travel_instructions: " Fast travel (via airboat, 'The Swamp Fox') back to 'Broken Bayou Bridge,' wade through muck to den ."
          enemies_at_den: "Feral Swamp Crawlers (may have respawned)."
          destruction _method: "Use Swamp Gas Bombs. Select on P.A.D., walk up to pulsating organic mass, press [ ACTIVATE] button on bomb."
          aftermath: "Stroll away, let den explode, sift through gooey  remains for salvage."
        - location_description: "Near where your airboat first sputtered to a halt. South-east  of the 'Gator Jaw Crossing' signpost (gator skull on a pole)."
          travel_instructions: "Head south -east across the irradiated marsh, through the ruined scavenger camp, and to the elevated roadway beyond. Continue south, pass over  another, smaller collapsed overpass, and head downhill into a bioluminescent fungus patch."
          enemies_at_den : "Feral Erpenthropes (quicker and hit harder than Crawlers)."
          destruction_method:  "Repeat bomb process."
      loot_note: |
        Looting dens should earn you a "Pre-Calam ity Circuit Board" (valuable salvage), which is worth a bit in trade, but can also be broken down by a  Tinkerer into "Gold Filament" and a "Synthetic Gem." All in all, it might be a better idea to hang onto  them, in case you need to scrap them for high-end crafting later.
      objectives_rewards:
        - objective : "For destroying a Feral Erpenthrope Den"
          reward: "20 XP"
        - objective:  "For destroying... another Feral Erpenthrope Den!"
          reward: "20 XP"

      preparation: | 
        Return to the Lickskillet settlement (Primal Mama's White Orchard village equivalent – a collection of shacks and  processing platforms built over the water). Repair your gear at the crank-operated workshop, sell off excess gator hides and mutant  glands, all that other fun stuff.

       discoveries:

          key_item_found: "The skillet."
          observation: "Skillet – described as old and sooty  – has been meticulously scraped clean by her 'guests.' The harvested soot wasn't for ink, but rather a crude  conductive paste, likely for repairing some scavenged tech."
      resolution: "Leave shack, give Mama Beulah her skillet  and some advice. She gives a reward."
