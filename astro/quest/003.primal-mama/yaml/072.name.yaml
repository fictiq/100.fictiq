    - stage_number: 1
      title: "Lickskillet Departure : Through the Veil Tear"
      context: 'You need Old Man Jaco''s help navigating the strange spatial  distortions rumoured to exist deep in the hazardous, unregulated processing run-off swamps south of Lickskillet. He believes these " Veil Tears" are echoes of the Calamity and keys to forgotten truths.'
      action: 'Follow Old  Man Jaco from the humid, bustling heart of Lickskillet, past the mom-and-pop gator  processing shacks, towards the shimmering, chemically-stained southern swamps. He leads you to a derelict pre-C alamity pumping station half-submerged in stagnant water. Inside, Jaco indicates a warped section of wall crackling  with faint, unnatural energy. "Used my Aard-equivalent back in the day... well, somethin'' like  it. Knocked a hole right through reality''s hide right here. Still thin." If the warped concrete and rusted re bar haven''t fully collapsed, use a heavy tool, explosive charge, or perhaps focused sonic emitter (if available) to re- open the passage. Step through the shimmering distortion – the air smells thick like ozone and overripe swamp fruit.'
     - stage_number: 2
      title: "Irradiated Salt Flats: Jaco's Lament & Rust-Bot  Ambush"
      environment: 'You arrive not in deeper swamp, but blindingly bright, cracked salt flats shimmering  under a relentless sun. Strange, crystalline formations jut from the ground, humming faintly. The air is dry and tastes metallic. This is  likely a zone heavily scarred by pre-Calamity industrial waste or a failed post-Calamity terraforming attempt .'
      action: 'Follow Jaco as he strides across the desolate expanse, shielding his eyes. He gestures at the sterile  landscape, perhaps muttering about the folly of the "old world''s" power hunger or the hubris that likely led  to the Calamity. "See this? What happens when you choke the Mama dry, thinkin'' your fancy  wires are better''n her roots. Sun''s strong here... powers things best left rusted." As you approach another shimmering  Veil Tear hovering near a cluster of salt crystals, Jaco pauses. "Rift''s actin'' shy. Needs  a moment to... ripen."'
      combat: 'Before the Tear stabilizes, the ground trembles. Malfunctioning, crab- like maintenance automatons (`CREATURE_RustBot_01`), built with classic late-70s chunky plating  and exposed wiring, erupt from beneath the salt crust. Their optical sensors glow an angry red. Their rusted claws and basic  welding tools prove surprisingly dangerous. **Fight off waves of Scuttling Rust-Bots (Level equivalent: Mid-tier  mechanical threat)**. Their movements are jerky, predictable, but their numbers and resilience make them a nuisance. Once the last  bot sparks and falls silent, the Veil Tear stabilizes into a swirling vortex of murky green energy. Jaco nods. " Mama''s ready for us. Step lively now." Head through the portal.'
    - stage_number:  3
      title: "Bio-Luminescent Spore Fields: Swamp Lung & Gram's Respite"
      environment : 'You emerge onto a high, rocky outcrop overlooking a vast, unnervingly beautiful swamp basin filled with pulsating, bio-lum inescent fungal growths. The air below shimmers with thick, iridescent spores. You are separated from Jaco, who likely  appeared on a different outcrop.'
      action_hazard: "Head south-west down a broken natural ramp, then  turn south to spot the next Veil Tear shimmering faintly across the basin. The challenge here is the **Suffocating Spore  Cloud**. Descending into the basin floor triggers rapid oxygen depletion (or causes \"Swamp Lung,\" a debilitating status effect). The  rule: **High Ground = Breathable Air**.\n  *   Follow the outcrop around the pillar you arrived on. Climb  a short ledge to the east, then carefully drop down another onto a slightly lower, but still safe, rocky shelf.\n   *   Spot a ramp leading south, down into the thickest spore clouds. You need to cross quickly. Sprint south  through the choking, shimmering haze onto another safe, raised ledge. Catch your breath.\n  *   Loot a weathered  skull adorned with faded Mardi Gras beads tucked into a crevice on the wall here (`ITEM_FadedOffering_01`).\ n  *   Now head west. You need to drop *down* off the ledge into a slightly less dense patch  of spores, breaking the \"high ground\" rule momentarily, but reaching a clear path leading upwards again."
    - stage_ number: 4
      title: "Shrine of Parsons & Leaps of Faith"
      exploration: " Continue west up a short, rocky ramp. Turn south, scale another mossy ledge, and continue south along the ridge.  Tucked away in a small alcove, you find a crude but clearly venerated **Shrine to Gram Parsons (`LOC_ ParsonsShrine_01`)**. Weathered vinyl records, empty bottles of fine bourbon, and fossilized swamp  orchids are arrayed before a faded, iconic image of the musician. **Interact with the shrine to gain a temporary \"Cos mic Clarity\" buff (improves perception, maybe grants brief resistance to spores, or a minor skill point equivalent).**"
       action_hazard: "Return north along the ridge and look out over the sea of glowing spores. To the north- west, you spot a small 'island' of higher ground. Drop down a ledge into the spores (which seem particularly aggressive here,  draining breath/vitality faster) and make a desperate scramble onto the north-western island. A dose of `CONSUM ABLE_GatorGumbo_Endurance` or similar might help extend your lung capacity.\n  *   From this island , look south across a wider expanse of spores. Spot the next set of ledges in the distance. This is a longer run . Take a running start and leap/scramble across the hazardous basin floor to the southern ledges.\n  *    Climb two ledges quickly, turn south-east, and climb a third. Look south again – more spores,  but perhaps less dense. You can see the distinct skeletal rib cage of some colossal, long-dead beast half-buried in the  muck. Beyond it, the next safe ledge.\n  *   Drop down, sprint through the giant rib cage (feeling  an odd spectral chill), and scale the ledge to the south. The air clears slightly here. Turn east. Overlooking  one last expanse of spores, you spot the shimmering Veil Tear. One final dash east takes you through the portal."
    -  stage_number: 5
      title: "Flooded Bayou Suburb: Sunken Relics"
       environment: "You materialize underwater in the eerily preserved ruins of what looks like a pre-Calamity suburban neighbourhood , now completely submerged by the encroaching swamp (`LOC_SunkenHomes_01`). Waterlogged cars rest in driveways,  plastic flamingos drift near submerged mailboxes, and strange, adapted aquatic life flits through broken picture windows. The Veil Tear you need  is visible shimmering south of your position."
      action: "You can surface for air easily. The water is murky but  relatively safe. Take your time exploring the sunken homes. Loot `CONTAINER_WaterloggedSatchel`, `CONTAINER_Sub mergedToolbox` etc., for potentially useful salvage, pre-Calamity trinkets (low value, high flavour ), or perhaps even a rare waterproof schematic fragment (`ITEM_SchematicFrag_RetroAqua`). When ready, swim leisurely  through the silent, watery streets to the southern Veil Tear and pass through."
    - stage_number: 6
      title : "Automated Abattoir: Sonic Hell & Cold Circuits"
      environment: "The oppressive humidity vanishes, replaced by frig id air and the low hum of dormant machinery. You're inside a vast, derelict automated alligator processing facility (`LOC _AutoAbattoir_01`) – an early post-Calamity attempt at industrializing the new food source, now  abandoned. Metal catwalks crisscross above enormous, silent processing vats. Everything adheres to the chunky, analog-heavy  1970s aesthetic, but coated in frost and decay."
      hazard: "The environment itself is hostile.  **Malfunctioning Sonic Sterilization Fields or Cryo-Coolant Leaks** permeate the area. Lingering in exposed zones  causes rapid health drain (simulating the blizzard's effect). You need to find shielded areas – control rooms, behind  heavy machinery, inside dormant freezer units – to recover. The air itself bites with cold or resonates painfully in your bones. Save frequently when  you reach safety. Your health *will* regenerate in sheltered spots, but the damage ticks up fast when exposed."
      action _exploration: " *   Head north from your entry point and drop down a short ledge onto a main concourse. Turn west  into a frosted metal corridor. Follow it until a collapsed section blocks your path. Use a tool or ability (perhaps a conc ussive blast, or finding a control panel to retract a jammed door) to clear the way.\n  *   Your  first safe zone is north-west: Duck into a small, shielded control booth built into the wall. An \"X\"  crudely spray-painted in faded orange marks the doorframe. Wait for health to recover.\n  *   Follow the  catwalks north. Find shelter behind a large, inert turbine housing.\n  *   Turn east. Spot a set  of grated stairs leading up to a raised platform with protective railings. Sprint east across the exposed concourse to reach the stairs.  Huddle near the eastern edge.\n  *   Pan your view north. See another shielded control room across an icy gap.  Sprint north-east, ducking behind rusted machinery, and enter the room. Look east – spot a conveyor belt ramp sloping  down to the north.\n  *   Slide down the ramp. A brief cutscene might trigger: Your character spots  scorch marks or deactivated security drones, commenting \"Somethin'' fought back hard here... or the machines ate themselves .\"\n  *   Turn south-west from where you land and enter a larger processing bay. Head up a short flight  of stairs into an observation office. Find a `TOOL_PortableHeater` or an intact control panel to activate emergency  heating, restoring health quickly. Search a locker near some deactivated automatons (`CORPSE_MechBodies_01`) to find ` LORE_FadedWorkLog` detailing malfunctions and strange energy readings before shutdown.\n  *   Leave the office  and run down a ramp to the north. Continue until you find shelter inside a U-shaped bank of machinery. To the west is  a heavy blast door, also marked with an orange \"X\". Seems Jaco (or someone) marked the path.\n  *    Enter the doorway. Drop down into a maintenance tunnel. **Combat:** Two reactivated **Security Automatons (`CREATURE_Sec Bot_70s_01`, Level equivalent: Tough mechanical enemy)** engage you, their single red optic sensors glowing. Their  attacks might include stun prods, sonic bursts, or heavy kinetic rams. Defeat them. Find a functional emergency power conduit nearby  and activate it (`INTERACT_AuxPowerSwitch`) to light up the area and provide warmth/safety. When ready, prepare for  another sprint from the tunnel exit.\n  *   Your goal is north, across a large, open factory floor.  Too far for one go. Run north, keeping your view angled west. Spot an open doorway into a side storage room.  Duck inside to recover.\n  *   Leave shelter, head north again. Keep looking west – spot a foreman'' s office with distinctive angled, faux-wood paneling, half-buried under collapsed ductwork. Scramble through a broken  window to get inside. Loot the office, find a panel to activate local heating, and discover `LORE_ForemanMemo`  near skeletal remains (`CORPSE_HumanRemains_01`), perhaps mentioning strange signals or sabotage before the facility failed .\n  *   Head north from the office through a doorway, back onto the hazardous floor. Directly north is another small  shelter (a shielded loading bay alcove). Reach it quickly. (Ignore a less accessible shelter to the south-west).\ n  *   One final sprint north. Keep going until you reach a sturdy blockhouse wall with metal stairs leading up north -east. Approaching the blockhouse provides protection from the hazard. Head up the stairs and into the structure – likely a central  control tower. Pick up `LORE_ChiefEngineerDiary` near the north-east doorway, detailing the final chaotic  hours. Continue out onto a catwalk extending from the tower. Look out a breach in the railing to the north-east. Spot  a large hangar bay door with the tell-tale shimmer of a Veil Tear within. That''s the exit.\n  *    You can either sprint directly north-east across the remaining hazardous floor to the hangar, or head due north first to find a small  cluster of emergency heating pylons (some might still be active, providing safe spots). If you take the pylon route, expect  a final ambush by **more Security Automatons or perhaps Feral Processing Drones (`CREATURE_ProcDrone_Feral_ 01`)**. Defeat them and proceed up stairs east to the hangar entrance.\n  *   Inside the relative safety of the  hangar entryway, descend a final set of stairs. Old Man Jaco awaits, leaning against a control panel, looking unsur prised. \"Took yer time. Place gives me the chills. Too much... quiet noise.\" Catch up with him, discuss the  nature of the Rifts or the purpose of this journey. He gestures to the final, stable Veil Tear. \"Veridian'' s next. Hope you''re ready for high society stink.\" Head through the portal."

       title: "Beetriot Sky-Garden & Oligarch Confrontation"
      environment: "You arrive in the stark,  opulent contrast of Beetriot – specifically, a lush, climate-controlled garden terrace atop one of the tallest skyscrapers (`LOC_Ver idianSkyGarden_01`). Prized, genetically pure (and inedible) Cattle graze peacefully under artificial sunlight, tended by silent  automatons. Old Man Jaco stands waiting."
      action: "Follow Jaco north through the ostentatious  garden, past displays of pre-Calamity art fused with 70s retro-tech aesthetics. Find ** Magnate Veridian (`NPC_Veridian_Oligarch`)**, perhaps observing his cattle or engaged in a complex holographic  board game. The conversation is tense. Veridian is powerful, possibly ancient (maybe even an Erpenthrope himself , hiding in plain sight), and deeply suspicious."
      resolution: "Jaco explains the need for truth. Ver idian scoffs. Jaco initiates a **Ritualistic Ghost Communion** (`ABILITY_GhostCommunion_01`),  using his Erpenthrope connection to the spectral realm (perhaps aided by an artifact you recovered). This allows Veridian to  witness a spectral echo – perhaps a crucial conversation revealing the origins of the \"Invisible Women\" conspiracy, or a glimpse of the true  Calamity event, directly implicating figures Veridian respects or fears. Shaken, Veridian agrees to share specific, encrypted  data (`ITEM_VeridianDataChip_01`) or provide access needed for your larger quest. This potentially completes  a major objective chain (e.g., \"Finding the Calamity's Cause\") and begins the next phase (e. g., \"Decoding Veridian's Legacy\")."
