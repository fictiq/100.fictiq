  title: "Primal Mama: Gator Gus's  Grievance & The Crankshaft Conundrum"
  initial_rumor: "Word on the humid L ickskillet airwaves (likely crackling over an old CB radio) is that a musician, Buck \"Banjo \" Beaumont, known for his soulful swamp ballads and tales of pre-calamity folk heroes (like the deified  Burt Reynolds), has gone missing. He was last seen trying to get a gig with \"Gator\" Gus Reptilio, a  big shot in the Lickskillet alligator processing scene, possibly one of the \"oligarchs\" mentioned as causing  friction."

       steps:
        - description: "Let's start by tracking down this \"Gator\" Gus. To find him , head north from the main Lickskillet market barge, past the flickering neon sign of the \"Greasy Gator  Grill.\" When the boardwalk splits near the bubbling methane seeps, take the western, more rickety path (the eastern one leads  towards the Purity Patrol's imposing, blocky precinct house). Shortly, you'll see a surprisingly well-maintained, albeit  rust-streaked, corrugated iron structure adorned with blinking, oversized Christmas lights (despite the season) and what looks like  a repurposed bank vault door – this is Gus's Humidor & Hydroponics Hub, his base of operations." 
        - interaction_point: "Knock on the heavy door. A slot slides open, revealing suspicious eyes.  Drop the name \"Buck 'Banjo' Beaumont\" and mention you heard Gus might know his whereabouts. After a tense moment,  the door groans open."
        - description: "You'll be led through steamy, surprisingly lush hydropon ic gardens (likely growing exotic herbs or perhaps even base components for some of the more \"esoteric\" local concoctions) under  flickering fluorescent lights encased in chunky, amber plastic. The air is thick with the smell of damp earth, ozone, and expensive  cigar smoke (or its local equivalent). You'll meet Gus – a large man in a loud, synthetic 7 0s-style leisure suit, adorned with gator-tooth jewelry – and other shady figures of Lickskillet's under belly, all gathered around a table made from a giant, petrified cypress stump, its surface inlaid with mother-of -pearl depicting alligator hunts."
        - event:
            name: "Ambush"
            description: " Your meeting is violently interrupted by an attack – Crankshaft Cody's Bayou Boys (Level 11 Goons with modified spe arguns and rusty machetes, Level 12 Brute with a salvaged jackhammer) burst in, clearly looking  for trouble. Help Gus's men fend them off."
            aftermath: "After the dust settles and the  air clears of curses and cordite, the atmosphere is even more tense. A formidable Swamp Witch matriarch, Mama Roux , glares at Gus, mutters something about \"amateurs attractin' heat,\" and sweeps out with her entourage . A nervous-looking individual known as \"The Ghost-Whisperer\" also makes a hasty exit."

Crankshaft is not only trying to muscle in on  Gus's alligator processing turf but is also rumored to be dabbling in dangerous, forbidden pre-calamity tech  and possibly even trying to establish a black market for *actual cattle components* – a massive taboo. Gus needs to find Crankshaft before  Mama Roux (who has her own vendetta against Cody for stealing sacred swamp herbs) tears Lickskillet apart looking  for him, or worse, before the Purity Patrol gets wind of Cody's more heretical activities."
