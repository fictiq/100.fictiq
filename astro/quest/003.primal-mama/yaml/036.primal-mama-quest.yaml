QuestOverview:
  QuestGiver:  "Jebediah \"Jeb\" Cottle, a nervous, independent alligator trapper/processor from a small , unnamed hamlet near Lickskillet."
  Locations:
    - "Jeb's Hamlet"
    -  "A specific stretch of the Saurian Sanctuary's periphery"
    - "A hidden alcove within the deeper swamp" 
    - "Potentially a brief interaction point in Lickskillet"
  Premise: |
    J eb's usually reliable GE Alligator traps, which rely on solar-charged lures and 1970s -aesthetic sonic emitters, have been failing. Worse, the few alligators he *has* managed to catch recently have exhibited  strange, sluggish behavior and their normally vibrant solar-absorption patterns are dull and tinged with an unnatural crimson hue. He  suspects foul play from a GatorCorp subsidiary trying to muscle him out, or perhaps a new swamp sickness.
  Core Conflict: "Investigation of an anomaly, potential confrontation with natural or unnatural forces, uncovering a localized ecological imbalance or a new  form of interference."
  PotentialThemes:
    - "Man vs. Nature (altered)"
    - "Con sequences of GE"
    - "Corporate overreach vs. individual survival"
    - "The pervasiveness of the  world's \"miasma.\""

QuestStructureAndObjectives:
  Phase1_TheComplaint:
     Title: "The Complaint"
    Objective1:
      Description: "Speak to Jebediah Cottle in  his hamlet."
      Details: |
        Jeb is agitated. His livelihood is threatened. He'll show  the player a malfunctioning lure (chunky, wood-paneled, with a dim, flickering LED display) and perhaps  a data-cassette (1970s style) with erratic energy readings from a recent "sick" gator. 
      PlayerActions: "Listen, ask questions about the symptoms, GatorCorp's recent activities, any unusual swamp phenomena."

        Deontic:
          - "Automaton /LLM User Stigma (Jeb might mention he can't afford or trust an Automaton diagnostician)" 
          - "Friction from meat processor oligarchies"
        Axiological:
          - "Value of alligator meat for  survival."
  Phase2_OnTheTrail:
    Title: "On the Trail"
    Objective1 :
      Description: "Investigate Jeb's trap line near the Saurian Sanctuary."
      Details: " Player travels to the designated area. Traps are indeed inert or malfunctioning."
      PlayerActions:
        - " Use Witcher Senses-equivalent (e.g., \"Swamp Sense\" or \"Primal Attunement\")  to examine traps, lures, and the immediate environment."
        - "Find crimson-stained cattails or algae near  affected traps."
        - "Discover faint, unusual energy signatures or biological residue on lures that doesn't match typical  alligator spoor."
      WorldCoherenceLinks:
        Alethic:
          - "Alligator Biogenesis ( understanding normal gator function vs. this anomaly)"
          - "Solar Dominance (lures should be working)" 
        Epistemic:
          - "Player gathers knowledge about the anomaly."
    Objective2_Optional:
      Title : "Analyze a residue sample (Optional)"
      Description: "Analyze a residue sample."
      Details: |
        If  player collects a sample, they might take it to a contact in Lickskillet (e.g., a back -alley bio-tinkerer who works within the 70s tech constraints but understands GE basics).
      PlayerActions :
        - "Interact with the bio-tinkerer. The analysis (done on chunky, analog equipment) might be  inconclusive or point towards an unknown biological agent, possibly with strange energy-leeching properties."
        - "The  tinkerer might have a \"stain on their reputation\" if they use a hidden, jury-rigged LLM  for cross-referencing, adding a small social risk/dialogue element."

        Epistemic:
          - "Access to specialized knowledge."
   Phase3_TheCrimsonSource:
    Title: "The Crimson Source"
    Objective1:
       Description: "Follow the trail of crimson cattails/energy signatures deeper into the swamp."
      Details: "The  trail leads away from the main sanctuary waterways into a less-traveled, gloomier part of the bayou."
      PlayerActions : "Navigate the swamp, potentially encounter mutated swamp flora/fauna (minor threats, e.g., overly aggressive gar, glowing  fungi that pulse erratically). The 1970s aesthetic could mean the player's navigation tools are somewhat  rudimentary (e.g., compass and paper map with hand-drawn additions, a chunky depth-sounder)."

        Alethic:
          - "The \"strangely spiritual miasma \" influencing the environment."
    Objective2:
      Description: "Discover the source of the crimson anomaly."
       Details: |
        The trail leads to a hidden alcove or a small, isolated island where a cluster of "Vamp ire Bunnies" have established a warren. These bunnies aren't drinking blood, but their fur (or some  excreted substance) has taken on a crimson hue after they've gnawed on specific, bio-luminescent roots that have  become hyper-energized by runoff from a faulty, buried solar power conduit (1970s era, of  course, and leaking). The bunnies are now inadvertently leeching energy from nearby solar-powered devices (like Jeb's lures) and  affecting the alligators that consume plants growing near their warren.
      PlayerActions: "Observe the bunnies. Examine the glowing  roots. Discover the damaged conduit (perhaps with a rusted, wood-paneled access hatch)."

        Alethic:
          - "Vampire Bunny Propagation (their existence is fact)"

  Phase4_Resolution:
    Title: "Resolution"
    Objective1: 
      Description: "Deal with the Vampire Bunny infestation and the faulty conduit."
      PlayerChoicesAndConsequences:
        Choice A_ExterminateBunnies:
          Title: "Exterminate the Bunnies"
          Details: "Player  can try to clear the warren. This is messy and might anger a local Swamp Witch if these are *her*  bunnies (see \"Potential Complications\"). Alligators and lures recover quickly. Jeb is happy."
        ChoiceB _RepairConduit:
          Title: "Repair/Seal the Conduit"
          Details: "Requires finding a  way to patch the 1970s-tech conduit (perhaps needing specific parts, or a jury-rig that fits the  aesthetic). This stops the hyper-energizing of the roots. Bunnies return to normal. Alligators/lures recover slowly  as the crimson effect dissipates. Jeb is eventually happy. This might require interacting with a grumpy, old-school solar  technician."
        ChoiceC_ConsultSwampWitch:
          Title: "Consult a Swamp Witch"
           Details: "If the player suspects a deeper supernatural element or discovers signs of witchery (e.g., small fetishes near  the warren), they might seek out a local Swamp Witch. She might explain the bunnies' new behavior is due to the \" energized roots\" and offer a ritualistic solution to cleanse the area or relocate the bunnies (perhaps for a price,  or a favor). This is the most \"Primal Mama\" solution."
      WorldCoherenceLinks: "All  Modalities come into play depending on the choice. `Spectral Interaction` might be relevant if a witch uses ghosts to help . `Swamp Witch Lore` is key for option C."
  Phase5_ReportingBack:
    Title : "Reporting Back"
    Objective1:
      Description: "Inform Jebediah Cottle of the outcome ."
      Details: "Jeb's reaction and reward will vary based on the player's solution and its  speed/effectiveness."
      PlayerActions: "Dialogue, receive reward."
      WorldCoherenceLinks: "The resolution reinforces the  world's internal logic."

PotentialComplications AndBranches:
  GatorCorpInterference: |
    While not the direct cause, a GatorCorp agent might be  snooping around, trying to buy out Jeb on the cheap due to his "bad luck," or even trying to steal his trap locations  once they seem abandoned. Player might confront them.
  SwampWitchsWrathOrAid: |
    If the  bunnies belong to a specific Swamp Witch, killing them might incur her wrath. Conversely, approaching her respectfully might lead to her  offering a unique solution (e.g., a ritual to calm the bunnies or shield the traps, in exchange for a rare  alchemical ingredient only found in a ghost-haunted part of the swamp).
  ErpenthropeWitness: |
     An Erpenthrope, in their pursuit of "truth," might have observed the strange bunny behavior and could offer cryptic clues if  the player encounters them.
  TechnologicalChallenge: |
    Repairing the conduit might involve a mini-puzzle conforming  to the 1970s tech aesthetic – e.g., rerouting power using specific chunky switches in a sequence, or  finding a vacuum tube replacement for a control unit.

Rewards:
  Standard:
    - "Crowns" 
    - "Crafting materials (alligator parts, common swamp resources)"
  ChoiceDependent:
    ExterminatingB unniesQuickFix:
      Details: "Exterminating bunnies + quick fix for Jeb"
      Reward: "Higher cash  reward from Jeb."
    RepairingConduit:
      Reward: "Moderate cash reward, perhaps a unique 19 70s-style gadget schematic from an old solar technician."
    SwampWitchSolution:
      Reward : "Lower cash reward from Jeb, but a unique charm/talisman from the Witch, or access to new ritual knowledge/ recipes. Maybe a \"Vampire Bunny Repellent\" recipe that uses Burt Reynolds' Old Spice aftershave ( a nod to deified celebs)."
  Reputation:
    - "Minor positive reputation with independent trappers"
     - "Minor negative with GatorCorp if their agent is thwarted"
    - "Significant positive or negative reputation with the local Swamp  Witch."

WorldCoherenceAndInternalLogicNotes: |
  This quest directly engages with the `Alethic ` modalities of GE Alligator solar dependence, Vampire Bunny existence, the 1970s tech constraint, and the perme ating "miasma" of the swamp.
  It explores the `Deontic` modality of the meat oligarchy's  pressure on small operators.
  The player's choices reflect different `Axiological` approaches – pragmatic destruction, technical problem- solving, or embracing the supernatural/spiritual side of the world.
  `Epistemic` modality is central,  as the player uncovers the true, unexpected cause of the problem, moving beyond Jeb's initial (and plausible) conspiracy  theory.
  The quest aims to feel like a natural occurrence within Primal Mama, where advanced biotech, retro aesthetics, and strange  swamp phenomena collide. The "death by burger" rule isn't directly invoked, but the reliance on alligator meat underscores  its importance.
  The potential involvement of an Automaton/LLM-using tinkerer reinforces that specific social stigma .
  The solution involving a Swamp Witch and her unique lore provides a distinctly "Primal Mama" flavor.
