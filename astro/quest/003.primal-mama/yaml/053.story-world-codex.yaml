       First, however, head north-east from this makeshift camp to find... another derelict shanty with a Hidden Stash ! Along the way, you might encounter more Gator-Pups (genetically unstable alligator runts) or packs of F eral Hogs. The shanty itself is likely crawling with more of them. When the mutated critters have been chased off, search  the wreckage. Seems like somebody came out for a little "communion with the spirits of Burt and Jerry" (a common,  if often ill-fated, swamp ritual), but was overwhelmed by the local bio-hazards. Loot the water -logged sacks outside the collapsed lean-to, then turn your attention to the goodies inside. In a rusty footlocker, you 'll find a "Greasy Datapad" (stylized with chunky buttons and a flickering CRT display) containing "Po acher's Notes." These notes describe the treasure we looted in the earlier task, "Oligarchy Off-C uts," detailing a hidden cache of untagged gator glands.

      Head south-east until you find some towering, algae-covered concrete remnants  of a pre-Calamity flood barrier, upon which our destination lies. Make your way south to reach the western end  of the barrier to find a precarious series of rusted ladders and makeshift ramps leading to the top. Swamp Scrappers (des perate outcasts, often exhibiting minor mutations), however, might object to you simply walking in and ransacking their hideout. Dispatch  the first two you meet (watch for improvised nail-guns and sharpened scrap metal). Continue uphill to find another four,  including a tougher, hulking Scrapper wielding a stop sign mounted on a pipe (functioning as a makeshift shield). Save  him for last and exterminate his support with your trusty (and culturally approved) firearm. When only the shield-bearer  remains, you'll have to find a way to get around his crude defense. You can either blast him with a focused  sonic burst from your "Gator-Caller" (if you've jury-rigged one with such a function , adhering to the 70s aesthetic for its casing) to disorient him, then get around him for a few quick  hits, or just parry his clumsy attacks. Once they're dead, let the looting begin!

      Near the  beginning of the hideout, you'll find a tattered tent near a sputtering solar-powered lamp, near which you' ll find assorted synth-sacks, oil drums, and plastic crates to loot. Further uphill under another patched-up  awning are even more sacks and parcels. North-east of here, near where the shield-scrapper and his buddies  were, you'll find a somewhat sturdier, pre-Calamity emergency shelter, outside of which are  some reinforced crates, a bio-luminescent fungus barrel, and another package. Inside the shelter, you'll find three chests —two large, wood-paneled footlockers near a filthy mattress, and a smaller ammo box in a corner . When the smaller box is looted, the task "Tainted Tallow" will be completed (revealing illegally rendered  animal fat, definitely not gator). On a makeshift shelf made of cinder blocks and planks, you'll find a " Water-Stained Memo" on what looks like old fax paper, addressed to a "Foreman Thibbodeaux" in L ickskillet, hinting at illicit trade bypassing the Meat Oligarchy's control.

     description: |
      Only one more bit of exploration to do before we finally go pay a visit to the local Meat Oligarchy  representative (or perhaps a Swamp Witch for information). Return to Lickskillet proper and do what business you need to do (maybe  trade some gator skins for solar cells or ammo). Then follow the main raised boardwalk through Lickskillet, heading  west (and slightly south). Pass the "Gator-Bite Grill" (Notice Board equivalent), the smoking ruins of a  'shiner's still, and past Mama Agnes's shack (an old Erpenthrope who mostly keeps to herself ) to the north. It should be pretty easy to stay on the main boardwalk and avoid any detours onto treacherous swamp trails.  Keep going south-west until you spot another half-submerged pre-Calamity bungalow north of the boardwalk,  wherein you can score some scavenged supplies.

      Get back on the main boardwalk heading south-west and continue to follow it  in that direction until you spot a small, muddy trail veering off in a more radical south-western direction, which  ends near a ruined airboat dock. Inside the collapsed boathouse are two waterlogged bodies for you to loot (likely  victims of Vampire Bunnies or a misjudged swim). Do so, then return to the main boardwalk again. Carry  on until you spot a Meat Oligarchy "Resource Collection Point" south of the boardwalk, this one surprisingly free of the usual propaganda posters  featuring deified celebrity mascots. There are more items to loot here (mostly gator processing byproducts and discarded tools), but  again, you'll have to be careful not to let the armed Oligarchy Thugs (likely low-level en forcers with a bad reputation for Automaton use) see you. They're more vigilant here, so you might not be able  to get everything.
    note: |
      In between this camp and the "Sunken Highway" landmark,  you might encounter Swamp Striders (fast, insectoid creatures that hunt in packs) or the occasional solitary Adolescent Solar  Gator that's wandered from a farm.

    primal_mama_title: 'Reclaimed Processing Shack'
    description: |
       When you're done looting, return to the boardwalk again. This time our aim is to follow one of two  other rickety boardwalks to the north that connect to the one we were on... and with each other, forming a triangle  on your map display (if your retro-handheld device is still functional). These boardwalks, once joined, lead north  to the "Old Sawmill" landmark (now just a collection of rusted metal in the muck). West of this landmark is  another Reclaimed Processing Shack currently occupied by a quartet of Bog Ghouls (devolved humans, victims of prolonged exposure to Cal amity mutagens). Kill them, and some hardy Swamp Folk (likely independent gator trappers) will move in to the area , even being so kind as to set up a Makeshift Workbench (for weapon and gear maintenance, all with that 7 0s vibe) for you to use.

      Loot the newly-inhabited shacks and the nearby collapsed  gator pen. There are even a few Giant Irradiated Beehives around. The bees will sting you if you get  too close, of course, and their venom can cause temporary paralysis (again, piling on the absurdity of post-C alamity nature). Use your Solar Lighter (a common piece of 70s-style tech) or a well-aim ed flare on the hive to pacify the bees and cause the hive to fall, which you can loot for Glowing Honeycomb. Don 't sell any of this yet, as the local Swamp Witch (when we can finally get her to talk) will give you a  pretty penny for them, or trade for potent ritual components. Last and not least, a new scavenger-merchant will show up  here sooner or later. He doesn't sell anything earth-shatteringly good (mostly scavenged junk and stale  protein paste), but it's another place you can drop off excess gator hides for some much-needed "Trade  Chits" (local currency).

    description: |
      From the formerly-Abandoned Shack, head north through the dense, bio-luminescent mangroves , perhaps stopping to harvest some mutated flora or fight off some more Gator-Pups. Eventually, you'll find a Sc rapper Ambush point, occupied by the usual desperate, poorly-equipped scavengers. Defeat them, then search around their  crude lean-tos for goodies—most of which is located around their central fire pit (fueled by rendered gator fat).  The best loot can be found in a locked tool chest behind a makeshift barricade of tires and corrugated metal, and in  a waterlogged duffel bag beside a moldy sleeping roll.

    primal_mama_title: 'Oligarchy Cache' 
    description: |
      To the north is a bubbling, noxious marsh, where we'll likely face the  old hazard of Murkfiends (amphibious humanoids adapted to toxic waters), and a new hazard— pockets of explosive methane. The latter can be used, in conjunction with your Solar Lighter or a well-placed shot, to  help deal with the former, if you're sneaky like that. Just be wary—methane is wonderfully combustible, but it' s also disorienting. North-west of the Scrapper Ambush point, you'll find an Oligarchy Cache,  constituting a dead Oligarchy Thug, his wrecked fan-boat, and a reinforced strongbox lying in the muck.  Dispatch any Murkfiends or Bloatflies guarding it and get to looting.
    note: |
      Stay out  of the deep marsh at night, as it'll be crawling with Murkfiends and larger, more aggressive swamp  predators. Unless you want to fight a bunch of them, of course. In which case... head into the marsh at night ! They're some of the few critters that drop valuable glands, and it's really the only way to sc rounge for rare components at this point in time. You may also find solitary Erpenthropes in their beast  forms in the deep swamp. They're rare, avoid contact unless provoked, and not terribly difficult to *evade * if you're quick.

    description: |
      Travel east through the marsh  and, eventually, you should come to a slightly more stable patch of raised earth with a barely visible trail running more or less north -south. Follow it south and out of the worst of the marsh until you hear somebody calling for you east of the trail . Head over there to find a nervous-looking fellow in worn, but clean, 70s-style coveralls, fidd ling with a sputtering solar charger by a small campfire. Ask him what's wrong and he'll vaguely babble about  some "big-toothed horrors" in the marsh. Geralt, annoyed by the amateurish attempt at deception (especially  if he's an Erpenthrope used to seeking truth), sets him straight. The fellow will then tell a  slightly more coherent story. Apparently, his cargo skiff was "swamped by a rogue wave" (unlikely in these  parts) caused by a giant, unseen swamp beast, and he wants you to go find his goods... or at least a  "small, reinforced data-case" that seems to be particularly important to him. Agree to help him, then... well,  head back north into the marsh (after tracking the task in your wrist-mounted Pip-Boy-esque device, of course).

       The site of the "attack" is only a short way to the north; just follow the trail and keep your enhanced  senses (or a jury-rigged scanner) active. You should spot some fresh drag marks running off the trail and into the marsh . Investigate them, loot a nearby discarded ration pack, then veer north-west into the marsh. Near the center of the  new search area, just west of a half-sunken pre-Calamity satellite dish, you'll find the  skiff, a dead pack-gator (not a wild one, but domesticated), and the scattered cargo. Check  the gator and the skiff to observe that they've been hit with high-caliber rounds from a rifle—not too many  swamp beasts use those. Continue looking around with your senses to spot a body to the east, also the victim of gunfire.  You come to the only logical conclusion—our "merchant" friend lied. The data-case we're looking for  is just north of the wreckage, partially submerged. Pick up the "Locked Data-Case" and return to the "merchant." 

      You can simply give the faker his data-case back, which ends the task, but it's more interesting to call  him out on his deception and find out what all the lies (not to mention the bullet holes) were about. Take  him to task for lying and he'll pull the old "look out, a giant mutant gator!" gag. Sadly , he doesn't realize your senses (or your companion Automaton, despite the social stigma of using one) are too acute for  that nonsense. Instead of coming clean, however, he tries to make a break for it.

    description: |
      You're now south of the Old Sawmill landmark,  and all the fun stuff we have left to do is back north. So... slog it back north. Our next destination is between  the two murky channels that run north-south through the marsh, east of the Scrapper Ambush point we cleared out  earlier. It's worth exploring the lightly irradiated, fungus-covered hummocks between the two channels, however, as they contain valuable  mutated herbs to harvest, Feral Hogs and Giant Bullfrogs to hunt, and more Giant Irradiated Beehives to  raid. The place of interest here, however, is a patch of Sacred Ground whose location was previously disclosed by a cryptic utterance from a  ghost contacted via ritual. It's guarded by a level six Lingering Specter (a powerful, tormented remnant from the Biological  Calamity, possibly an early victim). We've encountered similar entities before, so this should be manageable with the right tools ( perhaps a "Spectral Disruptor" built with 70s tech aesthetics, or specific ritual preparations). You might want to consider  saving your progress on your handheld device before you engage it, as it has a chance to drop Ectoplasmic Residue . Getting a dose of this will allow us to upgrade one of our weapons with spectral properties (preferably a melee weapon for close encounters ) or enhance a piece of sensory equipment, saving us a good haul of Trade Chits in the process. In any  event, draw upon the spiritual energy of the Sacred Ground (perhaps by touching a strangely preserved statue of Burt Reynolds inexplicably found  here).

      Head over to the eastern of the two  channels that cut up through the marsh and... well, wade or swim up through it. Along this eastern channel, you' ll find a "Sunken Supplies" event. You know the drill—several Murkfiends or perhaps a pack of  aggressive Snapping Turtles are guarding some loot. Kill them and take what's yours.

      Continue north-west along the channel until you pass under a collapsed  pre-Calamity overpass (a concrete arch). After the arch, veer off to the north-east and go  for a swim (or use a small raft if you've found one) to the east to find the "W reckage Riches" event. Near a wrecked fan-boat that's somehow still partially afloat, tangled in giant  lily pads, take a dive to find some valuable salvage near another, completely submerged hovercraft.
