    location: "The  Bayou Sanctum [PM: Erpenthrope hidden training ground]"
    protagonist: "Gator Gene R ault [PM: Erpenthrope, our Geralt equivalent]"
    introduction: |
      The game begins with  a steamy scene – Gator Gene is soaking in a naturally heated sulfur spring, trying to wash off the swamp funk... Until  a particularly grabby Crawdad, likely summoned by his Swamp Witch associate, Jolene [PM: Yennefer equivalent , powerful Swamp Witch], pinches him in a sensitive spot. She materializes from the mist, draped in spanish moss  and Cthulhu-goth charms, chastising him about neglecting the training of young Cypress [PM: C iri equivalent, a uniquely gifted individual, perhaps latent Erpenthrope]. The two get dressed in their patched denim and  gator-hide vests, and a day in the life of an Erpenthrope begins.

          Or rather, the game's tutorial begins. Your first task  is to find the key to your shack, which you've wisely secured with a chunky, 70s-style padlock  to keep curious swamp critters (and maybe Jolene) out. Aside from pointlessly tinkering with solar-powered bug zappers  and examining various swamp curios (getting some dry commentary from Gene and sharp retorts from Jolene), there's not much to do . In the north-western corner of the shack, on a worn copy of "Burt Reynolds' Guide to Bayou  Livin'" on a crate near the door, you'll find your wayward brass key. Of course, you're  supposed to be trying out your "Erpenthrope Senses" **[L2/LT]** [PM: Heightened  senses, possibly with bio-luminescent highlights for interactables]. Hold that button down and, if you've ever used an old  fish-finder, you'll understand the purpose – it highlights interactable objects with a faint, phosphorescent glow.  In this case, the key we need. Grab it and open the door. Yes, the game even gives you a  tutorial for opening doors. Turns out you have to face them and press **[X/A]**. Who knew?
         note: |
          "All directions will be given in relation to the mini-map, a chunky, wrist-mounted device with  a flickering CRT display. It's a pretty nifty piece of 70s retro-tech that'll make  both our lives easier."

        description: |
          Unlock the door and sa unter outside, Gene-style. Once in the Sanctum's clearing, Gene will note that his mentor – P appy Vole [PM: Vesemir equivalent, elder Erpenthrope] – who was supposed to be teaching Cypress  swamp lore, has failed at his duties. Instead of some dull flora identification, Cypress decided to practice her knife-throwing on some  repurposed oil drums while Pappy Vole caught forty winks in his rocking chair. After some gruff chatter with Pappy  Vole, Gene heads over to instruct the young aspiring survivalist. After chatting with Cypress for a bit, she'll ask  if you want to "run the stilt-walks", which is a handy, more in-depth tutorial covering  basic mobility in the treacherous swamp environment.

        title: "Running the Stilt -Walks"
        content: |
          If you chose to "run the stilt-walks", start out  by heading west and climbing a rickety ladder **[X/A]** onto a stilt-house platform,  then scale two moss-covered platforms to the north **[Circle/B]** and climb onto a narrow walkway to the west . Drop off a ledge to the north, then another to the south before climbing down a knotted vine-ladder to the east . Head down some muddy stairs to the south and climb down another vine-ladder, then navigate some wooden walkways to the  west, going down two more flights of stairs and another ladder. Once all this is done, your goal is to head  east into a sunken grotto to find Pappy Vole, who is waiting with "Lanky" Lambert and "Easy"  Eskel [PM: Other Erpenthropes, retaining names for familiarity but re-contextualized], two other resident  Erpenthropes.
        note: |
          "The Bayou Sanctum seems to have retained at least  some of the same basic defensible design from pre-Calamity fishing camps. Very cool touch."
        conclusion : |
          Pappy Vole will give Cypress the grumpy old man treatment before finally moving on to combat training. Accept  the tutorial if you wish to learn more about combat (why wouldn't you?) or pass.

      - type : tutorial_section
        title: "The Fundamentals of Swamp Scrappin'"
        introduction: |
           Choose to "start with the fundamentals" and Gene will claim a trusty Gator-Gutter [PM: Machete /heavy blade, steel sword equivalent] for him to use. The game will briefly introduce you to the three basic tools  of an Erpenthrope – blades, retro-tech gadgets [PM: Signs equivalent], and swamp brews [PM: Alchemy  equivalent]. For now, we're focusing on blades. Press **[Left]** on the D-pad to quick-draw  your Gator-Gutter (useful for fighting hostile scavengers or Oligarchy enforcers, who tend to wear repurposed  scrap armor). Bio-Disruptors [PM: Specialized blade for GE abominations/supernaturals, silver sword  equivalent] will come into play later when we're hunting particularly nasty mutated critters, who are vulnerable to their specific energy  frequencies.
        steps:
          - description: |
              Once your blade is out, lock onto Pappy Vole by  pressing down on the **[R3/RS]** button, then perform a series of Fast Attacks **[Square /X]**, followed by Strong Attacks **[Triangle/Y]**. Next up, dodging **[Circle/B]**. P appy Vole gives ample warning before he attacks (telegraphing with a grunt and a shift in his stance), so  you should have no trouble scoring two dodges that this task requires. Next you'll need to roll out of the way twice ** [X/A]**, which is more of the same, except Pappy Vole's attacks are even more obvious. What 's the difference? Dodges are shorter and faster, best for dodging quick swamp vermin and retaliating. Rolls  are good for dodging heavy, slower attacks from things like agitated GE Gators. Parrying is the next order of business –  simply hold down **[L2/LT]** to parry all of Pappy Vole's attacks.  Finally, it's time to practice ripostes. Hit **[L2/LT]** as Pappy  Vole attacks to block-and-counter him.
          - description: |
              Now it's time  to move onto Retro-Tech Gadgets. Press **[L1/LB]** to open the Quick Access Device  Wheel, from which you can select your Gadgets. The first up is the Chrono-Shell Emitter [PM: Quen  equivalent, 70s tech device creating a brief personal stasis field]. Select it, then cast it by pressing ** [R2/RT]**. Chrono-Shell blocks damage, and is eminently useful for mitigating harm from a charging  gator or a shotgun blast. Cast it and let Pappy Vole hit you – to no effect. Then switch to the  Solar Flare Projector [PM: Igni equivalent, focused solar energy burst from a handheld device], which projects a cone of intense  heat at your foe, handy for harming or dispatching a group of weaker Mirelurkers, or perhaps setting a flammable swamp gas pocket  alight. Next up is the Suggesto-Phonic Modulator [PM: Axii equivalent, handheld device emitting sublim inal audio persuasion], which Gene can use to disorient foes or subtly influence conversations (especially useful given the Automaton/LLM  stigma, as this is *human-driven* persuasion). Last up is Yrden-brand Static Trap [PM:  Yrden equivalent, deployable device creating an area of slowing static electricity].
          - description: |
              Blades and Gad gets are done, which leaves only Swamp Brews. First up are Bio-Grenades [PM: Bombs equivalent]. Press ** [L1/LB]** again and access the lower half of your radial, which contains equipped alchemical items (brews , grenades, gator-oils). Select a "Swamp Gas" Bio-Grenade, then chuck one at  Pappy Vole **[R1/RB]** (don't worry, it's a training version ), then head to the selected spot and toss some more grenades at some training dummies (old tires hanging from trees), this time holding  down **[R1/RB]** to free-aim with a clunky, projected targeting reticle.
         conclusion: |
          You can now freely train with Pappy Vole, and it's nice to have the  gloves off. Practice dodging, countering, attacking... all that good stuff. The training ends when you sheathe your Gator-Gutter . After an unsettling psychic tremor [PM: Dream intrusion equivalent, perhaps a ghostly echo or Erpenthrope premonition], so  does the vision in which the tutorial occurred.

        title: "In the Wake of the Meat  Oligarchy's Goons..."
        introduction: |
          Gene will wake up with a gasp, and the old Erp enthrope, Pappy Vole, will start fussing over him. Either reveal the details of your vision-tutorial , or not. Afterwards the two will decide to head out. According to a garbled radio message Gene received from Jolene , their destination was the ruined pre-Calamity town of Wiloughby, a rendezvous somewhat complicated by the fact that  the Meat Oligarchy's enforcers had recently "pacified" it. The Oligarchy's influence spreads, and  where their armored Hogs [PM: Heavily modified 70s trucks/vehicles] pass, Mirelurkers  [PM: Ghoul equivalent, common swamp scavenger] follow, drawn to the carrion.
        steps:
           - description: |
              This fact is punctuated by the Mirelurkers that will show up and attack you here . They're not challenging foes – dispatch them by using Fast Attacks with the Bio-Disruptor, then loot  them for any Bioluminescent Goop and Mirelurker Mandibles they might drop. If you get injured, you can  meditate by accessing your chunky wrist-mounted Pip-Boy-esque device **[Touch Pad/View Button]** and heading  to the "Meditation" screen (basically, finding a quiet spot to focus and let Erpenthrope regeneration kick in, accelerated  by certain swamp herbs). At this point in the game, you've got more time than disposable healing brews on your hands .
            note: |
              "Gene naturally regenerates one point of Vitality per second. Sadly, since  he starts the game with 3500 Vitality, this amounts to... well, frankly, piss-poor  regeneration. It will take nearly an hour to regenerate from near-death to full health without brews or meditation."
          - description:  |
              When you're done picking on Mirelurkers, return to your Mudskipper [PM: Airboat /Amphibious Vehicle, Roach equivalent] and from it head north-west, just past a small gator trail, where , with your Erpenthrope Senses active, you should spot a strange, 70s-style data-crystal  [PM: Crystal Skull equivalent] lying on the ground. Gene will guess this odd object belongs to Jolene. Might  come in handy.
            note: |
              "Using Erpenthrope Sense will cause interactable (usually lootable)  object to glow with a faint yellow bio-luminescence. Quest-related interactable objects will glow red. Hostile creatures will be  shown as white ripples (of varying size, depending upon proximity, like sonar). Objects that can be affected by specific Gadgets will  have that Gadget's symbol over them – typically objects that can be forced open with the Sonic Boom-Box or  ignited with the Solar Flare Projector."
          - description: |
              That's enough goofing around for now . Time to head over to your Mudskipper, hop in, and follow Pappy Vole. Don't worry , we'll return to explore this area in more detail shortly. Summon your Mudskipper by double-tapping ** [L3/LS]**. While piloting, hold down **[X/A]** to cruise, double-tap  and hold **[X/A]** to go full throttle (consuming more solar-charged battery), press **[Circle/ B]** for a short burst of speed (hydro-jet), and hold **[Circle/B]** to disembark . **[Square/X]** and **[Triangle/Y]** activate any mounted weaponry (like a harpoon gun  or a small-caliber auto-cannon, adhering to the 70s aesthetic), but it's not an  ideal way to fight.
          - description: |
              There are two larger bayou channels that eventually connect to the south  – you want to follow the eastern of the two. Pappy Vole will comment on the state of the Oligarchy's expansion  as you ride, showing a decidedly un-Erpenthropic view of human politics (which Gene doesn't fail  to comment on). When the channel turns from heading south-east to south you'll spot a makeshift gallows east  of the waterway with three swinging corpses in various states of decay – likely "gator poachers" or those who defied the Oligarchy . Follow the channel south-west to find a "Pillaged Shack-Town." Human ambition hits the poor the  hardest, and so it is here. Leave the traumatized survivors in peace for now and continue to follow Pappy Vole south,  then south-east, eventually crossing under a dilapidated pre-Calamity bridge.
            note: |
              "Old  radio relay towers serve as fast-travel waypoints. To use one, simply approach it, tune your wrist-device  to its frequency by hitting the **[X/A]** button, then select any other discovered relay tower to transmit  your travel request (which is then fulfilled by an automated airboat taxi service, all very 70s automated public  transport)."

      - type: sub_section
        title: "The Mega-Mosquito and the Watering Hole  [PM: Griffin and the Tavern equivalent]"
        introduction: |
          Some time later, Gene and Pappy V ole will run across a provisions skiff merchant being harassed by a GE Mega-Mosquito [PM: Griffin equivalent, a large , dangerous engineered creature]. The Erpenthropes will succeed at chasing the beast off (although, not in depriving it of its  gator-jerky meal) and Pappy Vole will be superficially wounded (a nasty proboscis stab) in the process . Afterwards, the maligned merchant will emerge from under his overturned skiff and offer to pay you for your good deed.  If you demand payment (using Suggesto-Phonics subtly, perhaps), you'll find yourself 50 Gator Pel ts [PM: Currency] richer. Afterwards, the merchant will overhear you talking about Jolene and the "Invisible Woman" conspiracy , and refer you to the Watering Hole in the village of Gumbo Grove.
        rewards:
          - objective: "For  asking the merchant for a reward"
            reward_value: "50 Gator Pelts"
        continuation: | 
          If you bother checking out your map you'll note that you've traveled north-west from where you were before the  cutscene, and you should continue west along the channel from the "Broken Levee" marked on your map. Pappy Vole  and Gene will discuss the Mega-Mosquito's odd hunting habits (targeting skiffs instead of wild gators). Seems  Erpenthropes will gladly attribute any odd monster behavior to human meddling or the lingering effects of the Calamity.  Keep riding east, cross "Jerry Reed Memorial Bridge" [PM: Nod to deified celebrity] to reach the village  of Gumbo Grove. Follow Pappy Vole to the Watering Hole (a ramshackle bar built on stilts)  and he and Gene will disembark and head inside.

          Witness some tension in the Watering Hole (local toughs eyeing  Gene suspiciously), after which Gene and Pappy Vole will talk to the innkeeper, Mama Roux. If you didn't  shake down her cousin (the skiff merchant) earlier, she'll be thankful and give you four Smoked Gator Sausages  [PM: Roasted Chicken Legs equivalent]. Keep talking to her to learn that there's no contract for the Mega-Mosquito yet . The Erpenthropes might speculate on why the creature has chosen abnormal hunting habits, but the reason why there 's no bounty can fully be blamed on the Oligarchy's recent "crackdown" scaring off local officials . Other than that, she sells some swamp rations and potent moonshine, and hasn't seen Jolene... although  somebody else in the tavern may have.
        note: |
          "Merchants have a fixed amount of Gator Pelts on  them at any given time. Fortunately, the entire economy of the bayou isn't dependent upon our actions – if you meditate  for a while (pass time), eventually the Merchants will replenish their pelts, and some of their wares (like fresh gator jerky  or scavenged 70s tech components)."
        rewards_2:
          - objective: "For not taking  the merchant's money earlier and talking to Mama Roux"
            reward_value: "4 Smoked Gator Sausages" 
        dialogue_steps:
          - description: |
              Start out by talking to a pair of Swamp Rats  [PM: Peasant equivalent] sitting north of where Pappy Vole roosts. They're a pair of banjo- strumming jackasses, but if you use the Suggesto-Phonic Modulator on one of them, you'll get  the information you seek – Jolene passed through here a few days ago. In quite a hurry, something about "seeking  the source of the Calamity's Echo."
            rewards:
              - objective: "For using Suggesto-Ph onics to get the Rat to talk"
                reward_value: "25 XP"
          - description: |
               Of course, it's not the most reliable of information, so we might as well keep asking. Ignore the  threesome playing "Gator Gambits" [PM: Gwent equivalent card game] east of Mama Roux, and  instead talk to "Smooth-Talkin'" Sam [PM: Gaunter O'Dim equivalent, mysterious, well-dressed stranger ] further east. As far as tavern patrons go, he's a rather dapper chap in his 70 s leisure suit, if a bit wearing on the patience with his folksy wisdom. Play as nice as the dialogue options will allow  and you'll score some "Solar-Powered Lemonade" [PM: Nilfgaardian Lemon equivalent] for free , as well as the information you seek. He not only knows Jolene by her description (Spanish moss and Cth ulhu-chic), but he knows *you*, Gator Gene. Seems tales of Erpenthropes travel far,  even among the "normal" folk. The Swamp Rats from before were right, but lacked sufficient information. The local Oligarchy garrison  might know more, but they're not exactly forthcoming with Erpenthropes.

      - type: sub _section
        title: "A Game of Gator Gambits"
        introduction: |
          Talk to the  threesome sitting at the table, and one fanatical Burt Reynolds worshipper will chase the other two off. Ask him about his " scriptures" (tattered movie posters and 8-track tapes), what he meant when he mentioned the "Sm okey and the Bandit Prophecy", and chat about Lickskillet's future as far as the Oligarchy is concerned.  Once that's done, go to leave and he'll ask you to play Gator Gambits with him. For  more information on Gator Gambits, check out the heading "Gator Gambit Strategies" in your wrist-device's codex. 
        gameplay: |
          Play your first match of Gator Gambits with the Burt Fanatic, and with any luck  you should win. He's not too bright, despite his devotion. If you play powerful, diverse gator cards (like  a "Solar Charger Alpha" or a "Regeneratin' matriarch"), he's really got no chance. Just  don't play all your cards in one round – you rarely get to draw new cards. If you build up a comfortable lead ( five Power or more higher) you might just want to pass. This will end the round for you, and there's  a chance he'll spend himself to victory, but if he does this on the first round, there's a good  chance he just won't have any cards left to compete with on the next two rounds.
        conclusion: |
           When you win (best two out of three rounds takes the game) you'll get the "Burt Reynolds - The Bandit"  Card [PM: Zoltan Chivay card equivalent], a Close Combat Hero Card that has no faction allegiance – it can  be played in any deck. Sweet. You can also buy more Gator Gambit cards from Mama Roux – she sells five,  including another "Pappy Vole - Elder Erpenthrope" Leader Card, three high-Strength gator cards with the  "Swamp Synergy" special ability (cards that amplify duplicate cards when played together) and a "Vampire Bunny  Decoy" card. In any event, the Fanatic will mention a certain "Gram Parsons Revivalist" you should look up later  in your travels. All this starts the quest "Collect 'Em All" (referring to celebrity deity cards and rare  gator variants). Seriously, be sure to buy these cards as soon as you can – you might not be able to later,  and missing out on the "Vampire Bunny Decoy", "GE Gator Bull", "Bayou Beastman Commando"  and "Swamp Witch's Hex" cards would be a shame.
        rewards:

            title: "Notice Board"
            introduction: |
              Leave the Watering Hole, whereupon  you'll discover that the local toughs who eyed you earlier are waiting for you outside, now bolstered by a few more of their  kind. Hatred of Erpenthropes tends to come paired with the lack of sense to avoid provoking them. And  so it is in this case, as well. A fight ensues regardless of what action you pick in response to them, but if  you use the Suggesto-Phonic Modulator you can earn some extra experience and take one of them out of the fight (making  him think he's a chicken, perhaps). Wisely, they choose fisticuffs as their weapons, so smack them around.  Gene might even partially transform a fist into a gator claw for extra punch.
            rewards:
              - objective: " For using Suggesto-Phonics on the Local Tough"
                reward_value: "40 XP"
               - objective: "For beating up the Local Toughs"
                reward_value: "350 XP "
            exploration_details: |
              It's finally time to start exploring – the Oligarchy garrison can wait , they're not going anywhere any time soon. We'll start with the village, where one would expect to  receive plenty of odd jobs, and then move on to exploring the surrounding bayou, focusing on points of interest (marked  on your CRT map as flickering question marks) as we go. Whenever possible our area of exploration will be centered around a  nearby Radio Relay Tower (which also double as a fast travel locations), but when that's not concise enough, geographic features ( a haunted cypress swamp, a derelict pre-Calamity chemical plant, a gator nesting ground) or simple directional bias  (the north-eastern stretch of the bog) will be used.

              Anywho, first things first, head down the rick ety boardwalk from the Watering Hole to the east a bit – there are a few waterlogged crates near the airboat moorings  worth looting, but as a general rule every box, crate, and sack won't be pointed out (unless they have  something particularly note-worthy inside, of course) – where you'll find your old pal the Skiff Merchant. You  remember him? He was almost eaten by a Mega-Mosquito. Seems he salvaged some of his stock, but air boat repairs take time and are expensive, so he's eager to sell off what goods he has while he waits. While  it's nice to catch up with him, he doesn't really sell much of interest... unless you installed the  "Bayou Bruiser Armor" DLC [PM: Temerian Armor DLC equivalent], in which case, he'll have a  full set of that reinforced gator-hide gear in his inventory. It's the best armor we'll immediately have  access to, and if you've got the pelts, it's worth buying.

              Turn around and follow the boardwalk  west, looting shacks and grabbing bioluminescent fungi as it pleases you. It's a good way to score some preserved rations , 70s tech scrap components, and perhaps a few Gator Pelts. Posted on a cypress tree to the south of the  boardwalk you'll find a notice scrawled on a piece of rusty sheet metal: "Wanted: intact Vampire Bunny ears . Will pay top pelt. Large quantities welcome. Tomira, the Bayou Herbalist." Good to know. [PM: Tomira  is a recurring character, an herbalist/Swamp Witch type, but not as powerful as Jolene].

               Continue west until the boardwalk forks. At the fork you'll find the Notice Board – that staple of any slightly organized swamp settlement which  bestows quests upon us. Even better, just looking at the Notice Board (even without taking any of the notices) will update  your map with a variety of "Unverified Signals" [PM: Undiscovered Locations]. These range from Mutated Crit ter Nests, Stashed Oligarchy Loot, Scavenger Camps, and other optional places worth exploring to score loot and experience . The notices worth grabbing are "Contract: Terror of the Tar Pit" [PM: Devil by the Well] which starts a  quest of the same name, and "Brother Drowned" [PM: Brother Missing] which starts "Lost in the Labyrinth ine Loosestrife". If you save and reload your game, new notices (hand-scrawled pleas or crude drawings ) will appear, but since none of them start new quests, there's not much point in bothering.

          - type:  quest
            title: "Solar Still Sabotage [PM: Twisted Firestarter equivalent]"
            introduction: |
              From the  Notice Board head south to find a very angry, grease-stained mechanic named Willis [PM: Willis the blacksmith] cursing  as he works at his makeshift solar-still forge. Talk to the poor guy and, as one would expect, he's  rather snippy. Keep cool and he'll tell you that somebody sabotaged his still – an act he feels was brought on  by tensions that arose when the Oligarchy's tax collectors came through. Offer to help him (for a price,  of course, Erpenthropes don't work for free unless it involves pretty witches or saving the world) and  he'll agree to give you whatever he has left in usable parts to find the cause of his misfortune. This begins  the quest "Solar Still Sabotage."
            steps:
              - description: |
                  First, note the Grind stone (an old, repurposed engine flywheel) to the north-east. Using it is free, and will sharpen your Gator -Gutter, giving you the "Keen Edge" boon for 15 minutes. Score. Head behind Willis's shack  and search to the south-east using your Erpenthrope Senses to spot some spilled moonshine and a discarded  wrench on the ground. Investigate them and Gene will deduce the saboteur's clumsy actions. Further south-east Gene  will find footprints, which seem to belong to a large man wearing cheap swamp boots. Follow them or less east to a cypress tree,  where Gene will detect the smell of cheap hooch and desperation – a common combination. Keep following the tracks east to reach  a waterway, then north-east until they terminate near a half-sunken pirogue. As drunk as our  saboteur was, he was at least wise enough to try and cover his trail by taking to the water. Loot a water logged chest to the north and pass under a fallen log to find where the tracks continue, north of the log. Signs of a struggle  are noted – apparently our saboteur was attacked by Mirelurkers and lost his boots in the scuffle. The trail continues to the  west and onto the boardwalk that runs through Gumbo Grove. Follow the wounded saboteur's trail to a shack just  south of the Watering Hole.
              - description: |
                  Head inside and Gene will comment that we'll be able  to spot our saboteur by the wounds he bears (and the reek of cheap moonshine). Search the eastern room to find N app, who is obviously drunk and injured. Talk to him and he'll confirm Willis's suspicions – a combination  of anti-Oligarchy sentiment and misplaced blame led the saboteur to wreck the still of a suspected collaborator (Willis had fixed  an Oligarchy goon's Hog). Knowing that he's in trouble, however, he'll offer to give you  some scavenged 70s tech components to let him go.
            outcomes:
              - choice: "Accept N app's offer to let him go"
                consequence: |
                  If you accept, Willis will be upset you  couldn't find the saboteur, but he'll still offer his services to you... which is really the point of all this .
                rewards:
                  - objective: "For talking to the saboteur Napp"

                consequence:  |
                  Alternatively, you can attempt to apprehend him. Doing so will provoke him to attempt to fist fight you (Erpenth ropes ain't known for their diplomacy). You can indulge him and pummel him into submission, or you can use the Suggest o-Phonic Modulator to subdue him and get him to come along peacefully ("You *want* to apologize to Willis . You *want* to help him fix the still..."). In the former case, you'll appear back near Willis , in the latter case, you'll have to escort Napp to him. Either way, the outcome is the same  – Willis confronts Napp, some Oligarchy patrolmen wander by, overhear the commotion, and decide Napp's  sabotage constituted disruption of vital solar infrastructure (a serious offense). They drag him off, likely to a labor camp or worse.  Once they're gone, Willis decides the Oligarchy aren't so bad if they deal with local troublemakers, and  will offer to work his forge for you.

            conclusion : |
              One way or another, we have a mechanic/fabricator at our disposal, which allows us to repair  our gear, craft new items (from scavenged 70s parts and gator hides), break down old items  for components, and of course, peruse his wares. Dismantling hides, junk tools, and inferior makeshift weapons is a good  idea, as it's a fine way to score components at little cost. You also are able to turn more refined components into more  generic ones (Circuit Boards into Copper Wire, for example), but at this point in time, there's little need  to do so. Consider dismantling all your Junk (rusted cans, broken radios), while leaving Crafting Components (wires, vacuum tubes,  gator teeth) and Alchemy Ingredients (bioluminescent fungi, strange swamp herbs) alone. For more information on crafting, see  the "Retro-Rigging Guide" section in your wrist-device.

              Of particular interest in his inventory are  the "Expanded Airboat Saddlebags" [PM: Saddlebags equivalent], which will increase your maximum inventory weight by 3 0, a boost of 50%. They cost nearly 200 Gator Pelts, however. Also, you might have  – or nearly have – the components required to upgrade your armor to the "Reinforced Gator-Hide Vest" [PM:  Warrior's Leather Jacket], depending on how diligently you looted the shacks in Gumbo Grove. All of this costs pel ts however, and right now the best way to earn pelts is by selling the strange swamp herbs we pick. They 're plentiful, they grow everywhere, and each one is worth a pelt. Hunting gators for hides works, too, especially  if you use the Solar Flare Projector to save wear and tear on your weaponry (and cook the meat a little).  Or... we could start exploring. That's an option, too. There's nothing stopping you from hunting game, killing mutated  critters, and picking herbs while we explore, either. In fact, it's recommended! Yeah... let's  do that.
