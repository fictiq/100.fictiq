        description:
           - "We've heard whispers that a shadowy Beetriot figure known as Silas \"Smooth\" Cooger might have  information on the whereabouts of Doc Paradox, a reclusive bio-engineer who vanished after allegedly acquiring forbidden Pre-Calam ity data. To find Cooger, head north from the main Solar Array Plaza in Beetriot. When the elevated walkway  splits, take the western ramp towards the luxury bio-domes. Shortly, you'll see the neon-lit, wood- paneled entrance to \"The Gilded Gator,\" Cooger's exclusive solar-powered spa and lounge."
           - "Knock on the reinforced teak door. After mentioning you're looking for Cooger regarding \"sensitive information,\"  your Erpenthrope protagonist, let's call him \"Bayou Walker,\" will be granted entry."

        description:
          - "Change into the provided plush  velour robe (70s chic, naturally) and follow Cooger's assistant through the humid, fern- filled spa. You'll meet Cooger – a man whose slicked-back hair and gold chains scream \"question able wealth\" – along with other figures from Beetriot's underbelly and Lickskillet's gritt ier side. Your meeting is abruptly interrupted by enforcers loyal to Cletus \"Catfish\" Jim, a notorious operator  in the shadier side of the alligator meat trade. Deal with Catfish Jim's Goons (armed with modified rivet guns  and shock batons, level equivalent 11-12)."
          - "After the scuffle, the  atmosphere sours. Mama Roux, a formidable matriarch of a Lickskillet gator processing collective, grumbles  about the disruption and departs. The Hierophant of Whispers, a gaunt figure who claims to commune with ghosts via jury -rigged radio equipment, also fades back into the steam. This leaves you and a now very wary Cooger to talk business.  This interaction potentially starts a side quest: \"The Bayou Brotherhoods.\""
          - "Once you talk to Co oger in private (perhaps in a room with a shag-carpeted conversation pit), you'll learn he's  less concerned about Doc Paradox and more about a personal, devastating loss. He also drops more disturbing details about \"Catfish\" Jim , who seems to be stepping on everyone's toes. Cooger believes Jim is behind his current predicament and might also know something about  Doc Paradox. We need to find Jim or strong leverage against him. Cooger suggests three places Jim operates: his heavily -guarded private \"Reclamation Ranch\" (rumored to house more than just scrap), his \"Greased Gator Casino,\" and  his brutal \"Swamp Stompin' Arena.\" If these leads dry up, Cooger might have other ideas."

          - "You can also ask Cooger about Doc Paradox directly. Before ending the conversation, save your game and  challenge Cooger to a game of \"Bayou Brawlers,\" the popular local irradiated card game. Cooger plays a surprisingly  weak \"Beetriot Elite\" deck – he has a few \"Celebrity Deity\" Hero Cards (maybe a \"Jerry Reed Gamb ler\" card) and likes to use \"Flash Flood\" (Weather) and \"Gator Death Roll\" (Scorch  equivalent) cards, but his basic unit strength is poor. Beat him, and he'll mention a reclusive Swamp  Witch who is a master \"Bayou Brawlers\" player, potentially reviving or starting a quest like \"Bayou Braw lers: Swamp Sages.\" Your prize for winning is the \"Burt 'The Bandit' Reynolds\" card, a 1 0 Strength Hero Card for the \"Free Trappers\" faction, otherwise nothing special."

          - "Ask Cooger about Doc Paradox again, and he'll  confirm Doc crossed Catfish Jim. He'll offer to leverage his network to find Doc Paradox *if* you handle  a delicate, urgent matter for him. Agree, and Cooger leads you down via a hidden elevator (complete with faux  wood paneling and an 8-track player softly playing Gram Parsons) to a secret sub-level of The Gilded Gator . Here, he reveals his problem: his prize-winning, cryo-preserved Charolais Bull Embryo – the  ultimate status symbol among Beetriot's elite, a relic of the pre-Calamity world – has been stolen . The thieves also sabotaged his luxury alligator hide tanning pools. He needs the embryo back, and the sabotage investigated discreetly.  He provides the formula for Mama Mamba's Miasma Mask, a potent herbal antidote to the toxic fumes now emanating from  the sabotaged area, which you'll need to explore the spa's drainage system."

          - "While you're down here, might as well help Co oger. Search the remains of a burst filtration pipe beyond a shattered poly-carbonate wall, then head north-west into the  spa's effluent tunnels. Activate your Erpenthrope senses (enhanced smell, vibration sense). Search a clogged maintenance  grate in an alcove to the north-west, then follow the sluggish, chemical-tainted current to the north-east.  When you reach a rusted sluice gate, turn north-west and investigate another residue-caked pipe on the floor.  Pop some Miasma Mask (it should auto-equip; each dose gives 360 seconds of protection, you have three )."
          - "Go through the sluice gate to the north-east, dispatch a Muckfiend ( a mutated amphibian, level 9) that was drawn by the chemicals, and investigate some more pipes on the wall.  Loot a sealed, water-damaged crate and other containers on a precarious metal platform to the north-west, then head down  some slippery steps to the east. Search some rubble at the end of the steps to find a gaudy \"Gold-Plated\"  Signet Ring (70s style) on the ground. Continue down a narrow service tunnel to the east, then  north to enter a junction chamber where you find a corpse in a cheap jumpsuit. Another corpse, similarly attired, can  be found to the north. Investigate it, and the cheap \"Chrome\" Ring that lies opposite him. Then turn west, where  you'll find another chamber occupied by several Muckfiends (level 9)."
          - "Clear the room,  then use your Erpenthrope agility to leap a gap and climb some rusted rungs to an upper gantry with  various discarded chemical barrels and toolboxes. When you're done looting, return to the lower level and search near the western  outflow gate to find part of a chunky, 70s-style sonic emitter device – the source of the sabotage. If  you continue west, you'll eventually reach the main Beetriot sewer canal, and Bayou Walker will comment on how the thieves  must have made their escape."

Search the eastern-most of the two pools  Cooger indicates, and you'll find another piece of the sonic emitter. Bayou Walker calls Cooger over. After  Cooger gets his nervous assistant, Happen (who looks like he stepped out of a 70s sitcom), to  consult the guest ledger (a physical, leather-bound book, of course), they find their likely saboteur is registered under the name  of a long-dead city official. Looks like you'll need to investigate the last known address of one Professor Pylon,  a disgraced bio-acoustic researcher."

Activate  your Erpenthrope Senses and search some muddy boot prints inside. Investigate a data-cassette cylinder (looks  like an oversized 8-track) on a shelf along the wall to the east. Loot the level, then follow  the trail upstairs, where you'll find a \"Bottle of Synthetic Wine (Chateau '78)\" and a \"Myst erious Schematic Printout\" to search. Bayou Walker will analyze the schematic when you pick it up.

          - " Go downstairs to see who's arrived, finding none other than Cooger, who has brought along Mystic Mavis, a  reclusive but powerful Swamp Witch known for her unsettlingly accurate premonitions and ability to manipulate ambient energies (all visually  filtered through a 70s psychedelic lens – think shimmering heat hazes and distorted light). Reveal what you discovered,  implicating an external agitator working with Pylon. Don't correct Cooger if he makes assumptions about your relationship with Mavis , if you want to gain her enigmatic approval. Cooger will leave, and Mavis will tell you to meet her by a  flickering Eternal Flame effigy (a repurposed gas flare stack) in the Lickskillet outskirts at midnight."

        description:
          - "When ready, head to the  Lickskillet outskirts and meditate (or just pass time) at the flare stack until midnight. Mavis will be there , outlining a plan to get information from Warden Steele, the zealous head of Beetriot's \"Aesthetic Conformity Bureau\" –  the very people who enforce the 1970s tech mandate and hunt down users of forbidden tech (like LL Ms or, gods forbid, anything *80s*). Steele is also rumored to have an iron grip on information flow regarding illicit  activities, as a sort of \"gatekeeper\" for the oligarchy. Mavis's plan is risky, and Bayou  Walker is initially (and perhaps rightly) skeptical."
      - step_id: "infiltrate_bureau_ hq"
        description:
          - "Bayou Walker will escort Mavis (playing the part of a captured \"rog ue technomancer\") to the Bureau's imposing, brutalist headquarters. The temptation of nabbing such a notorious  Swamp Witch should grant access. Access, but not to Steele himself. You'll need to continue the ruse. If you provoke  the Aesthetic Enforcers (level 9), you'll have to fight your way through. Kill the initial group , then go through a doorway to the south, where more Enforcers await. Fight your way up some concrete stairs to the  south and into Steele's office block, where you'll find Steele himself (level 10, armed with an electro -maul)."
          - "Alternatively, pick dialogue options like \"Wanna talk to Warden Steele,\" \"Got something valuable  for the Warden,\" and \"I'll tell your boss. No one else.\" to get escorted deeper into the stronghold . The Enforcers will then attempt to take Mavis for \"aesthetic re-education\" (read: brutal interrogation  with outdated, painful-looking devices). If you refuse, you fight them there."
          - "If you let  them take Mavis (dialogue: \"Fine, take her.\"), you'll be escorted to Steele, hearing  the muffled sounds of Mavis's \"re-education.\" Play it cool. Dialogue: \"Why not?\" to  accept a glass of synthetic whiskey. After Steele confirms your identity (perhaps via a clunky voice-print analyzer), say \"Your  Enforcers are 're-educating' the Witch, but I haven't been paid for my information.\"  Then, \"Erpenthropes will do anything for enough Solar Credits.\" Follow this with, \"I'm looking  for a certain... high-value embryo...\" This should get Steele interested in the Charolais Embryo."
           - "Finally, ask about Doc Paradox. If you pressed Steele about the embryo earlier, he'll realize you're playing him  and turn violent. You'll have to fight all Enforcers in the stronghold. Otherwise, it's just a topic  he's evasive on. In the latter case, Steele decides to check on Mavis's progress... which ends very  poorly for him as Mavis, having subtly gathered ambient energy, unleashes a disorienting psychic backlash (accompanied by stro bing lights and feedback screeches from nearby intercoms). This might start a quest related to Mavis, perhaps \"A Haze of  Hexes.\" If you started a fight earlier, you'll need to do more to trigger this."

        description:
          - "No matter how  it happened, Steele is incapacitated or dead. Mavis will search Steele. If you defeated him, you'll be told to  search his massive, imposing metal desk to find a \"Secured Data-Reel addressed to Warden Steele\" (which he would  have wiped if you talked your way in) and \"Steele's Concordance Manual\" (a ridiculously detailed list of approved  70s aesthetics). Mavis will find Steele's Master Keycard. Exit the stronghold via a locked service door  to the west. Once outside, Mavis, needing to \"realign her chakras\" (or just blow off steam),  tells you to visit her swamp-side shack later. She then causes a nearby propaganda holoscreen (stuck showing Burt  Reynolds PSAs) to spectacularly short out before vanishing into the urban gloom. Bayou Walker will have to climb onto the roof of an  adjacent building to the west, then jump an alleyway. Search a crumbling brick wall to the north to find it's weak –  blast it with an Erpenthrope kinetic pulse."

You'll find Mama Roux's enforcers (tough, no-nonsense  gator hunters). Head inside their main processing plant's office (a chaotic mix of gator skulls, 70s office  furniture, and dangerous-looking tools) to find Mama Roux overseeing her operation. After she's done berating a worker , she'll talk to Bayou Walker and propose an alliance – an Erpenthrope is a powerful asset alongside her seasoned  hunters. If you accept, this quest runs parallel to \"Hooking Catfish Cletus.\" Mama Roux will rule  out Jim's Ranch as too fortified for a direct assault by her people, suggesting you focus on the casino and arena.

Upstairs, investigate some strange, high-tech (but still 70s-styled ) restraining equipment on the wall, and some unusual feed troughs. After these three things are searched, Bayou Walker concludes this  place is a dead end for Doc Paradox, but it hints at Jim's *other* illegal activities (perhaps attempting  to illegally breed or experiment on *cattle* using forbidden Pre-Calamity tech).

Unfortunately, Mama Roux chooses this moment to launch her assault (if you didn't ally, perhaps it's  a rival gang or Beetriot Enforcers). Catfish Jim flees. Dispatch Igor (level 13)  and his goons. Loot Igor for his \"Control Key.\" Head east through the gate they entered from."
          - " Approach the eastern wall; Bayou Walker comments on unusual wear. Use Erpenthrope Senses to spot the secret door.  Activate the loose brick switch to the south. In the chest beyond, find the \"Sealed Communique\" confirming Jim's  illicit alliance."
          - "Read the communique, leave the secret chamber. Go up a tunnel north, through a gate , west around a corner, then up stairs and south through a gate. Help Mama Roux's hunters (or other  attackers) finish off Jim's remaining henchmen in the main control room. Loot the lockbox on Igor's table  for the \"Data-Chip from Igor.\" Backtrack west, then north up a tunnel (not back to the arena). Emerge  back to the surface."

          -  "Silas \"Smooth\" Cooger would be very interested in what you found about Catfish Jim. First, however,  visit Mama Roux (if you allied with her) and The Hierophant of Whispers (if you freed Rico and he  reports to the Hierophant's network of informants). Both might offer rewards. Mama Roux believes Jim is too arrogant to lay  low after these raids and pays generously. The Hierophant, for saving Rico, might gift you a unique spirit-warding amulet  or a piece of 70s-style enchanted gear, like the \"Silvered Boomstick\" (shotgun) and some  \"Road Warrior Reinforced Leathers.\" This completes \"The Bayou Brotherhoods\" and \"Honor Among Swamp Rats.\""

Co oger instructs you to visit an old contact, Reb \"Gator\" McCluskey, a former Beetriot Enforcer turned  independent swamp guide, who might know how to reach this faction, or Catfish Jim himself now that he's on the run.  Since you might have met Reb before (if he's a known quantity in Primal Mama), fast-travel to his  \"Swamp Shack\" signpost. Turns out Reb was about to meet a clandestine contact from this very faction near the  old, irradiated \"ChemZone Alpha\" ruins. He invites you along."
