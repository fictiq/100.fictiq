  main_parts:
    - part_title: "Tutorial: Quieter Times in the Swamp Shack "
      location: "Roux's Shack, Outskirts of Lickskillet"
      intro_narrative:  "The game begins pleasantly enough – the rugged, calloused feet belong to **Roux**, an **Erpenth rope**, who just so happens to be soaking in a reclaimed, algae-infused hydrotherapy tub (a relic of pre -Calamity luxury, now powered by a sputtering solar generator)... Until he gets startled by a bio-luminescent swamp slug,  a playful prank by his sorceress lover, **Mama Mambo**, a formidable **Swamp Witch**. She proceeds  to chastise him about being lazy while **Lil' Scale** (their young Erpenthrope ward) is out practicing . The two get dressed (Roux into his worn leather vest and patched jeans, Mama Mambo into her Cth ulhu-goth-Southern finery), and a day in the life of a Bayou dweller begins."
       opening_task:
        description: "Or rather, the game's tutorial begins. Your first task is to procure  an **Ignition Key** for the shack's rusty, reinforced door, which you've wisely secured."
         details:
          - "Aside from pointlessly fiddling with the flickering gas lamps (70s aesthetic) and examining various swamp -salvaged objects (getting some commentary from Roux and Mama Mambo), there's not much to do." 
          - "In the north-western corner of the room, on a stack of old vinyl records on a wood -paneled console near the door, you'll find your wayward key."
          - "Of course, you' re supposed to be trying out your inherent \"Erpenthrope Senses\" `[SENSE BUTTON]`, so hold that button  down and, if you've ever smelled a gator's breath from a mile off, you'll understand  the purpose – it highlights interactable objects, subtle heat signatures, or lingering spiritual traces. In this case, the **Ignition  Key** we need."
          - "Grab it and open the door. Yes, the game even gives you a  tutorial for opening doors. Turns out you have to face them and press `[INTERACT]`. Who knew?"
       note_hud: "[Primal Mama Note: All directions will be given in relation to the flickering compass on your wrist- mounted, chunky 70s-style \"Bayou Navigator\" HUD. It's a pretty nifty tool that 'll make both our lives easier.]"
      post_key_narrative: "Unlock the door and strut downstairs,  Roux-style. Once on the ground floor, Roux will note that his mentor – **Old Man Croaker**, another,  much older Erpenthrope – who was supposed to be watching Lil' Scale, has dozed off. Instead of some dull scale -polishing, Lil' Scale decided to terrorize some training dummies (repurposed Serv-O-Matons) while Cro aker caught forty winks in his rocking chair, surrounded by buzzing swamp flies. After some chatter with Croaker, Roux  heads down to chastise the young aspiring Erpenthrope. After chatting with Lil' Scale for a bit, she'll ask  if you want to \"run the gantlet\", which is a handy, more in-depth tutorial covering basic mobility." 

    - part_title: "Running the Gantlet (Mobility Tutorial)"
      steps:
        - "If you  chose to \"run the gantlet\", start out by heading west and climbing a rickety **access ladder** `[INTERACT] `, then scale two **rotting platforms** to the north `[JUMP/MANTLE]` and climb onto  a **slippery retaining wall** to the west."
        - "Drop off a ledge to the north, then  another to the south before climbing down another **ladder** to the east."
        - "Head down some **creaking stairs ** to the south and climb down another **ladder**, then navigate some **precarious wooden walkways** to the west,  going down two more flights of stairs and another ladder."
        - "Once all this is done, your goal is  to head east into a sunken, muddy courtyard to find Old Man Croaker, who is waiting with **Gumbo** and  **Etouffée**, two other local Erpenthropes."
      note_design_inspiration: "[ Primal Mama Note: The Kaer Morhen equivalent, Roux's training ground, seems to have retained at least  some of the same basic design from a pre-Calamity water treatment facility. Very cool touch, showing the layers  of history.]"
      combat_training_intro: "Croaker will give Lil' Scale the angry old gator treatment  before finally moving on to combat training. Accept the tutorial if you wish to learn more about combat (why wouldn't you ?) or pass."

    - part_title: "The Fundamentals (Combat Tutorial)"
      topics:
         - title: Melee Weapons
          description: "Choose to \"start with the fundamentals\" and Roux will claim his trusty **Bay ou Blade** (a heavy, reinforced machete) for him to use. The game will briefly introduce you to the  three basic tools of an Erpenthrope – **Melee Weapons, Swamp Juju (minor innate abilities), and  Bayou Concoctions/Jury-Rigged Tech**. For now, we're focusing on melee. Press ` [EQUIP MELEE LEFT]` on the D-pad to quick-draw your Bayou Blade (useful for fighting Cal amity Critters and unarmored humans). Specialized weapons like **Resonance Cleavers** `[EQUIP MELEE RIGHT ]` will come into play later when we're hunting heavily mutated beasts or spectral entities, who are vulnerable to their specific properties." 
          actions:
            - "Once your blade is out, lock onto Croaker by pressing down on the ` [LOCK-ON BUTTON]`, then perform a series of Fast Attacks `[FAST ATTACK]`, followed by Strong  Attacks `[STRONG ATTACK]`."
            - "Next up, dodging `[DODGE BUTTON]`.  Croaker gives ample warning before he attacks, so you should have no trouble scoring two dodges that this task requires." 
            - "Next you'll need to roll out of the way twice `[ROLL BUTTON]`, which is more  of the same, except Croaker's attacks are even more obvious. What's the difference? Dodges are  shorter and faster, best for dodging quick enemies and retaliating. Rolls are good for dodging heavy, slower attacks."
             - "Parrying is the next order of business – simply hold down `[BLOCK BUTTON]` to parry all  of Croaker's attacks."
            - "Finally, it's time to practice ripostes. Hit  `[BLOCK BUTTON]` just as Croaker attacks to block-and-counter him."
        - title: Swamp  Juju
          description: "Now it's time to move onto **Swamp Juju**. Press `[JUJU QUICK  MENU]` to open the Quick Menu, from which you can select your abilities."
          abilities:
            - name : "Scale Hardening (Quen equivalent)"
              instruction: "The first up is **Scale Hardening** (Qu en equivalent). Select it, then cast it by pressing `[CAST BUTTON]`. Scale Hardening temporarily toughens Roux 's hide, absorbing a hit. Cast it and let Croaker hit you – to no effect."
            -  name: "Swampfire Spit (Igni equivalent)"
              instruction: "Then switch to **Swampfire  Spit** (Igni equivalent), which projects a short burst of caustic, burning liquid at your foe, handy for harming  or dispatching a group of weaker critters, or perhaps setting flammable swamp gas alight."
            - name: "G ator's Grin (Axii equivalent)"
              instruction: "Next up is **Gator's Grin** ( Axii equivalent), which Roux can use to briefly disorient foes with a display of terrifying Erpenthrope intimidation,  or subtly influence weak minds in conversation."
            - name: "Mire Trap (Yrden equivalent)"
               instruction: "Last up is **Mire Trap** (Yrden equivalent), which creates a small patch of supern aturally sticky mud on the ground that slows enemies who enter."
        - title: "Bayou Concoctions and Jury -Rigged Tech"
          description: "Melee and Juju are done, which leaves only **Bayou Concoctions  and Jury-Rigged Tech**. First up are **Sparkplug Bombs**. Press `[JUJU QUICK MENU]` again and  access the lower half of your radial, which contains equipped concoctions and tech (healing draughts, bombs, blade oils ). Once selected, chuck a bomb at Croaker `[USE ITEM BUTTON]`, then head to the selected spot and toss some more  bombs at some training Serv-O-Matons, this time holding down `[USE ITEM BUTTON]` to free- aim."
      post_training_note: "You can now freely train with Croaker, and it's  nice to have the gloves off. Practice dodging, countering, attacking... all that good stuff. The training ends when you  sheath your blade. After an unsettling intrusion (perhaps a psychic ripple from a powerful entity, or a tremor from the unstable  swamp), so does the feverish memory-dream in which the tutorial occurred."

    - part_title: " Lickskillet Outskirts: The Hunt for Mama Mambo"
      sub_sections:
        - section _title: "In the Calamity's Wake..."
          narrative_intro: "Roux will wake up  with a jolt, and the old Erpenthrope, Croaker, will start chatting with him. Either reveal the details of  your dream-tutorial, or not. Afterwards the two will decide to head out. According to a cryptic message Mama Mambo left on  a scratched vinyl record, their destination was **Willoughby Creek**, a rendezvous somewhat complicated by the fact that the old stilt-village  was recently overrun by Calamity Critters. The influence of the biological calamity still warps these lands, and where  civilization falters, mutated horrors follow."
          first_encounter:
            description: "This fact is punctuated by the **M ucklurkers** (Ghoul equivalent) that will show up and attack you here. They're not challenging foes – dispatch  them by using Fast Attacks with your **Bayou Blade** (remember, it's coated in something nasty, good for these  things), then loot them for any **Mutagenic Glands** and **Mucklurker Ichor** they  might drop."
            healing_tip: "If you get injured, you can meditate by touching the `[MENU  BUTTON]` and heading to the \"Meditation\" screen (if you have **Swamp Whiskey** on hand, it  allows for faster healing and concoction replenishment). At this point in the game, you've got more time than disposable  healing items on your hands."
          note_regeneration: "[Primal Mama Note: Roux naturally regenerates Vital ity very slowly due to his Erpenthrope nature. It will take a long time to regenerate from near-death to full  health without aid.]"
          finding_memento: "When you're done picking on Mucklurkers , return to your **Swamp Skipper** (Geralt's Roach – a trusty, if somewhat temperamental,  GE Alligator mount) and from him head north-west, just past a small gator trail, where, with  your Erpenthrope Senses active, you should spot a **Burt Reynolds Prayer Bead** (Crystal Skull equivalent) lying  on the ground. Roux will guess this odd object belongs to Mama Mambo. Might come in handy."
          note _senses: "[Primal Mama Note: Using Erpenthrope Senses will cause interactable (usually lootable)  object to glow with a faint heat signature (yellow). Quest-related interactable objects will glow with a more intense, often reddish , heat or spiritual aura. Living creatures will be shown as distinct heat signatures (of varying size, depending upon proximity). Objects  that can be affected by specific Juju abilities will have that Juju's symbol over them – typically objects that can be shattered  with a powerful hiss (Aard equivalent) or ignited with Swampfire Spit.]"
          travel_prep: "That' s enough goofing around for now. Time to head over to your Swamp Skipper, mount up `[INTERACT] `, and follow Croaker. Don't worry, we'll return to explore this area in more detail shortly. Summon your  Swamp Skipper by whistling sharply `[SUMMON MOUNT BUTTON]`. While riding, hold down `[ACCELERATE]` to  canter, double-tap and hold `[ACCELERATE]` to gallop, press `[JUMP]` to make  the gator lunge/hop, and hold `[DISMOUNT]` to dismount. `[FAST ATT ACK]` and `[STRONG ATTACK]` allow attacks from gator-back, but it's not an ideal way to fight ."
          journey_description: "There are two larger mud roads that eventually connect to the south – you want to follow the  eastern of the two. Croaker will comment on the state of the swamp and the encroaching influence of the **Be etriot Meat Oligarchs** as you ride, showing a decidedly un-Erpenthropic view of \"progress\" (which  Roux doesn't fail to comment on.) When the road turns from heading south-east to south you'll spot a  makeshift gallows (a tilted, rusted water tower) east of the road with three swinging scarecrows dressed in rags, a  warning from some local toughs. Follow the road south-west to find a \"Flooded Hamlet\". The Calamity hits the  poor the hardest, and so it is here. Leave the desperate-looking scavengers in peace for now and continue to  follow Croaker south, then south-east, eventually crossing over a rickety bridge made of old road signs and  70s car chassis."
          note_fast_travel: "[Primal Mama Note: Old, graffiti-covered sign posts serve as fast-travel waypoints. To use one, simply approach it and hit the `[INTERACT]` button,  then select any other discovered signpost to travel there. These are remnants of a pre-Calamity highway system, now barely  maintained by swamp communities.]"

        - section_title: "The Sky-Terror and the Muddy Mug Tavern"
           encounter_narrative: "Some time later, Roux and Croaker will run across a **Swamp Scavenger** (merchant ) being harassed by a **Sky-Terror** (Griffin equivalent – a mutated, winged alligator or large predatory bird).  The Erpenthropes will succeed at chasing the beast off (although, not in depriving it of its meal – a pack  mule loaded with scrap tech) and Croaker will be superficially wounded in the process. Afterwards, the maligned Scav enger will emerge from under his armored, solar-panel-covered cart and offer to pay you for your good deed." 
          scavenger_interaction:
            dialogue_choice: "If you demand payment (`[DEMAND PAYMENT  OPTION]`), you'll find yourself 50 **Croc-Credits** richer."
            outcome: "Afterwards , the Scavenger will overhear you talking about Mama Mambo, and refer you to the **Muddy Mug** tavern in the  stilt-village of **Lickskillet**."
          rewards:
            - objective: "For asking  the Scavenger for a reward"
              reward_value: "50 Croc-Credits"
           travel_to_lickskillet: "If you bother checking out your Bayou Navigator you'll note that you've traveled north -west from where you were before the cutscene, and you should continue west along the road from the \"Gator Ford\" marked  on your map. Croaker and Roux will discuss the Sky-Terror's odd hunting habits. Seems Erpenthropes  will gladly attribute any odd monster behavior to Calamity fallout or reckless human bio-engineering. Keep riding east, cross \" Woebegone Bridge\" (a series of precariously linked pontoon boats) to reach the village of Lickskillet.  Follow Croaker to the tavern and he and Roux will dismount and head inside."
          tavern_arrival: "Witness some  tension in the tavern (perhaps between locals and some Meat Oligarchy enforcers, or distrust towards Erpenthropes ), after which Roux and Croaker will talk to the innkeeper, **Mama Gator**. If you didn't sh akedown her cousin (the Scavenger) earlier, she'll be thankful and give you four **Smoked Gator Legs**.  Keep talking to her to learn that there's no contract for the Sky-Terror yet. The Erpenthropes might speculate  on why the Sky-Terror has chosen abnormal hunting habits, but the reason why there's no bounty can fully be blamed on  the Meat Oligarchs suppressing local initiative. Other than that, she sells some questionable swamp food and potent moonshine, and hasn 't seen Mama Mambo... although somebody else in the tavern may have."
          note_merchants: "[ Primal Mama Note: Merchants have a fixed amount of Croc-Credits on them at any given time. Fortunately, the entire  economy of the swamp isn't dependent upon our actions – if you meditate for a while (or complete other tasks), eventually  the Merchants will replenish their money, and some of their wares, often through barter with other swamp dwellers or clandestine trade with Beet riot.]"
          rewards_innkeeper:
            - objective: "For not taking the Scavenger' s money earlier and talking to Mama Gator"
              reward_value: "4 Smoked Gator Legs"
           information_gathering:
            - target: "Swamp Rats (Peasants)"
              description: "Start  out by talking to a pair of **Swamp Rats** (Peasants) sitting north of where Croaker roost s. They're a pair of superstitious fools, but if you use the **Gator's Grin**  Juju on one of them (with a threatening display of teeth), you'll get the information you seek – Mama M ambo passed through here a few days ago. In quite a hurry, and muttering about \"invisible women.\""
               rewards:
                - objective: "For using Gator's Grin to get the Swamp Rat to talk"
                   reward_value: "25 XP"
            - target: "Silas \"Smooth Talk\" Jones"
              description : "Of course, it's not the most reliable of information, so we might as well keep asking. Ignore the threes ome playing **\"Gator Skat\"** (Gwent equivalent) east of Mama Gator, and instead talk to a mysterious , smooth-talking traveler further east named **Silas \"Smooth Talk\" Jones** (Gaunter O'Dim equivalent), who  seems oddly out of place with his pristine 70s leisure suit. As far as tavern patrons go, he's a rather  swell chap, if a bit wearing on the patience. Play as nice as the dialogue options will allow and you'll score  some **Nilfgaardian Lemon** equivalent, like \"Pre-Calamity Citrus Zest\" for free, as well  as the information you seek. He not only knows Mama Mambo by her description (and her reputation with certain Cthulhu- esque entities), but he knows you, as well. Seems tales of Roux's exploits (or perhaps the reputation of Erpenth ropes in general) travel far. The Swamp Rats from before were right, but lacked sufficient information. The local **Meat  Oligarchy representatives** stationed at the old **Sawmill Garrison** might know more."

        - section_title: " A Game of Gator Skat"
          intro: "Talk to the threesome sitting at the table, and one fanatic  (perhaps a worshipper of **Burt Reynolds**) will chase the other two off. Ask him about his \"sacred texts \" (dog-eared 70s movie magazines), what he meant when he mentioned the \"Great Smokey in the Sky \", and chat about Lickskillet's future as far as the Meat Oligarchy is concerned. Once that's done,  go to leave and he'll ask you to play Gator Skat with him. For more information on Gator Skat, check  out the heading \"Gator Skat Strategies\"."
          match_description: "Play your first match of Gator  Skat with the **Fanatic Scholar**. He's not too bright, despite his zealous belief in the divine wisdom of Jerry Reed . If you play powerful, diverse unit cards (like \"Solar Gator\" or \"Swamp Witch Matriarch\"), he 's really got no chance. Just don't play all your cards in one round – you rarely get to draw  new cards. If you build up a comfortable lead (five Strength or more higher) you might just want to pass. This  will end the round for you, and there's a chance he'll spend himself to victory, but if he  does this on the first round, there's a good chance he just won't have any cards left to compete  with on the next two rounds."
          winning_outcome: "When you win (best two out of three rounds  takes the game) you'll get the **\"Bandit's Trans-Am\"** Card (Zoltan Chiv ay equivalent), a Close Combat Card that has no specific faction alignment – it can be played in any deck. Sweet.  You can also buy more Gator Skat cards from Mama Gator – she sells five, including another **\"Lickskillet Boss  Hog\"** Leader Card (Foltest equivalent), three high-Strength **\"Gator Pit Fighter\"** cards with the \"Sw amp Synergy\" special ability (cards that amplify duplicate cards when played together) and a **\"Mirage Mire\"** card ( Decoy equivalent). In any event, the Fanatic Scholar will mention a certain **\"Brother Gram\"** (a  Gram Parsons devotee) you should look up later in your travels. All this starts the quest \"Collect 'Em All\". Seriously , be sure to buy these cards as soon as you can – you might not be able to later, and missing out on  the \"Mirage Mire\", \"Mud Puppy\" (Catapult), \"Bayou Bruisers\" (Blue Stripes Commando)  and \"Swamp Stompers\" (Crinfrid Reavers Dragon Hunter) cards would be a shame."
          rewards: 
            - objective: "For defeating the Fanatic Scholar at Gator Skat"
              reward_value: "\" Bandit's Trans-Am\" Card"
