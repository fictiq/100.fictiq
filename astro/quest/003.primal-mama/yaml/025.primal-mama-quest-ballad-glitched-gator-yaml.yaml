quest_title:  'The Ballad of the Glitched Gator'

quest_overview:
  quest_giver: 'Jededia h "Jed" Beaux, a grizzled, independent alligator rancher in the Lickskillet outskirts.'
   location: "Jed's Alligator Ranch (a series of interconnected, murky bayou pens), Lickskillet's local  \"Tech & Tinker\" shack, and potentially a discreet BayouCorp processing outpost."
  premise: "One of Jed's  prize genetically engineered (GE) alligators, \"Burt\" (named in reverence), has started malfunctioning. Its solar  absorption is erratic, its regeneration is sluggish, and its usually placid (for a 24-foot gator ) demeanor has become unpredictable. Jed suspects sabotage, possibly from the encroaching meat oligarchy (BayouCorp), or a  curse from Old Maude, the local Swamp Witch he recently underpaid for some \"protective\" charms."
  player_goal:  "Investigate the cause of Burt's malfunction, determine if it's sabotage, supernatural, or simple technological failure  within the world's constraints, and find a solution."
  core_themes:
    - 'Tradition vs. Progress  (Oligarchy vs. Mom-and-Pop)'
    - 'Technological Reliance & Vulnerability (within 19 70s aesthetic)'
    - 'Distrust of Authority/Corporations'
    - 'Bayou Super stition'

quest_steps:
  - step_title: "Step 1: Jed's Plea "
    description: "The player finds Jed Beaux agitated near one of his larger pens. Burt the alligator is list less one moment, thrashing erratically the next. Jed explains the situation, offering a handsome sum of Alligator Sc rip and prime gator steaks (the local currency and valued commodity). He mentions his suspicions about BayouCorp's recent  \"friendly inquiries\" about his ranch and his spat with Old Maude."
    coherence_check:
      alethic : "Establishes the existence and general capabilities of GE Alligators (`Alligator Biogenesis`). Hints at potential for  malfunction."
      deontic: "Highlights the economic pressure from `Meat Processor Oligarchies` and the local norms of dealing  with `Swamp Witches`."
      axiological: "Alligator meat as valuable (`Primary, acceptable... protein`), reverence  for deified celebrities (`Burt Reynolds`)."
      epistemic: "Jed's knowledge is limited to  ranching; he resorts to common beliefs (sabotage, curses)."

  - step_title: "Step  2: Initial Investigation - Observing Burt"
    description: "The player observes Burt."
    sub_points:
      -  "Witcher Senses (or equivalent Primal Mama sensory skill): Might reveal unusual energy fluctuations around Burt's solar  chromatophores, or a faint, artificial scent. The gator's internal bio-battery readouts (on a  chunky, 70s-style panel attached to the pen's control station) show erratic charging."
       - "Direct Observation: Burt's movements are jerky, his regenerative attempts on a minor scratch are slow."
     coherence_check:
      alethic: "`Alligator Biogenesis` (solar absorption, regeneration) is  shown to be failing. `Technological Aesthetic Constraint` is visible in the control panel."
      entity_function_ burt:
        current_state: 'Malfunctioning solar absorption, impaired regeneration, erratic behavior.'
        authenticated_baseline _pre_malfunction: 'Efficient solar energy absorption, rapid tail regeneration, predictable (trained) behavior.'

   - step_title: "Step 3: Following Leads"
    leads:
      - lead_title: " A. The Swamp Witch (Optional)"
        description: "Player visits Old Maude. She's initially hostile due to  Jed's underpayment. Player can bribe her, intimidate her (if capable), or do a small favor (e .g.: retrieve a particularly plump vampire bunny). Maude, using her esoteric methods (perhaps examining a scale from Burt or reading  gator-bone omens), declares it's \"no natural swamp curse\" but \"bad machine-juju .\" She might offer a (temporarily useful but ultimately ineffective) \"cleansing\" charm with a 1970s- style amulet."
        coherence_check:
          alethic: "`Vampire Bunny Propagation`, `Spectral  Interaction` (implied in her methods)."
          epistemic: "`Swamp Witch Lore` (her ability  to diagnose, even if not fix, the issue)."
          axiological: 'The transactional nature of dealing with a  Swamp Witch.'
      - lead_title: "B. The Local Tech (Lickskillet Tech & Tinker )"
        description: "Player takes a data-crystal (a chunky 8-track-looking thing) from  Burt's pen control panel to \"Sparky\" Pete, Lickskillet's tech. Pete works in a shack filled  with 1970s tools and salvaged parts. He grumbles about the difficulty of maintaining advanced biotech with \" stone-age interfaces.\" He might initially be wary of helping if BayouCorp has been leaning on locals."
        analysis : "Pete hooks the data-crystal to a clunky diagnostic machine (oscilloscope, analog dials, wood paneling ). He discovers anomalous code fragments or energy signatures, suggesting external interference rather than simple component failure. He might mention that the  interference pattern is \"too clean\" for typical swamp interference, almost like it's targeted. He might not have the components to fully  shield against it but could identify the *type* of interference."
        coherence_check:
          aleth ic: "`Technological Aesthetic Constraint` (Pete's tools, the data-crystal). `Solar Dominance`  (implies advanced understanding, even if interfaces are retro)."
          deontic: "`Automaton/LLM User  Stigma` (Pete prides himself on \"hands-on\" work, eschewing more advanced AI diagnostics even if they  theoretically exist)."
          epistemic: "Pete's `Technical Knowledge` is specialized in maintaining/repairing  tech within the aesthetic constraints."

  - step_title: "Step 4: Uncovering Sabotage"
     description: "Based on Pete's findings (or Maude's \"machine-juju\" hint),  the player searches Burt's pen and the surrounding ranch more thoroughly."
    discovery: "Using Witcher Senses/ sensory skill, the player finds a small, discreetly placed device camouflaged near the pen. It has a crude BayouCorp  logo scratched into its casing (or a serial number Pete can later trace to a BayouCorp batch order). The device itself  is a \"Bio-Disruptor\" â€“ a piece of 1970s-styled tech (ch unky, maybe a directional antenna, powered by a small, overcharged solar cell) emitting a focused energy pulse that interferes  with the GE Alligators' specific solar absorption frequencies and regenerative nanites."
    coherence_check:
       alethic: "`Technological Aesthetic Constraint` (design of the disruptor). BayouCorp's capacity for such tech is  implied by their oligarchy status."
      entity_function_disruptor:
        core_function: 'To  subtly impair the functionality of competitor GE Alligators.'
        capabilities: 'Emits targeted energy pulses.'
        limit ations: "Requires line-of-sight or close proximity; vulnerable to physical damage or specific counter-frequencies (if the player  can develop one). Its 1970s design might make it prone to overheating or its power source easily identifiable." 

  - step_title: "Step 5: Resolution Paths"
    paths:
      - path_ title: "A. Simple Fix"
        description: "The player destroys or disables the Bio-Disruptor . Burt's condition gradually improves. Jed is overjoyed and pays the reward."
        consequences: "BayouCorp' s involvement remains suspected but unproven. They might try again later."
      - path_title: "B.  Confrontation & Exposure (Harder)"
        description: "The player traces the device (via Pete's help or by  finding more clues) to a nearby, hidden BayouCorp monitoring station or a delivery agent in Lickskillet."
         sub_points:
          - "Player can confront the agent, leading to a fight or intimidation. The agent  might confess or try to bribe the player."
          - "Player could attempt to gather more evidence to expose BayouCorp  to the (ineffectual) local Lickskillet council or (more riskily) a rival corporation or an Erpenth rope truth-seeker."
        coherence_check_deontic: "This path tests the `Meat Processor Oligarch ies'` power and the local community's ability/willingness to act against them. `Gun Ownership (Regional)`  might come into play if a firefight ensues."
        consequences: "Higher reward from Jed, potential reputation gain /loss with factions, BayouCorp becomes a more direct antagonist."
      - path_title: "C. Supernatural Misdirection  (Player Error/Alternative)"
        description: "If the player focused solely on Old Maude and didn't investigate technologically , they might use her \"cleansing\" charm. Burt might show temporary, slight improvement (placebo, or the  charm coincidentally masks a symptom for a bit), but the problem will recur, leading Jed to be disappointed."
         consequences: "Lower reward, quest feels incomplete, underlying issue persists."

coherence_notes_ world_integration:
  - "This quest directly engages with the core economic conflict of Primal Mama: the tension between mom- and-pop operations and the `Meat Processor Oligarchies`."
  - "It leverages the `Technological  Aesthetic Constraint` by having the sabotage device and diagnostic tools adhere to the 1970s style, creating unique challenges for detection  and analysis."
  - "The GE `Alligator Biogenesis` rules are central, as their specific functions ( solar power, regeneration) are the target of the sabotage."
  - "The `Epistemic` modality is explored through Jed 's limited understanding, Maude's supernatural (but ultimately misdirected) insights, and Pete's specialized technical  knowledge. The player uncovers the \"truth\" of the situation."
  - "`Axiological` values like  self-reliance (Jed) and the value of alligator meat are reinforced."
  - 'The quest provides opportunities to  interact with diverse facets of Lickskillet society (ranchers, witches, techs).'
  - "The  \"death by burger\" rule is not directly invoked but the world's reliance on alligator meat as the primary protein source  underscores the importance of Jed's ranch."
  - "The `Automaton/LLM User Stigma`  is subtly reinforced by Pete's hands-on, analog approach to diagnostics, contrasting with a potentially more efficient (but  culturally undesirable) AI-driven analysis."
  - "This quest aims to feel grounded in Primal Mama's  unique blend of retro-futurism, bayou culture, and underlying societal tensions, using the established modalities and entity functions as its  foundation."
