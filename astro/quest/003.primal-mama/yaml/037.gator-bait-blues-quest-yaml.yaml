prerequisites: 'Access to Lickskillet.'

quest_log_entry: |
  Mama Creole, a  pillar of the Lickskillet gator farming community, is in a right tizzy.
  Her prize solar -charged, tail-regeneratin' breeding gator, "Big Earl," has vanished from his pen.
   She suspects the no-good Gator Grabbers gang, but somethin' about the scene smells fishier than week- old bait.
  She needs a sharp eye and a steady hand to track down Earl and deal with whoever's  responsible.

    title: "Meeting Mama Creole" 
    objective: "Speak to Mama Creole in Lickskillet."
    description: |
      Head to  the heart of Lickskillet, a ramshackle collection of stilt-houses and gator pens smelling of swamp gas and  fried gator tail. Mama Creole can usually be found near her main processing shed, a structure adorned with faded Burt Reynolds posters and  festooned with surprisingly sophisticated (though undeniably 1970s-styled) solar battery monitors.
      Approach Mama  Creole. She's a woman whose face tells a thousand swamp tales, her voice raspy but firm.

       - character: "Mama Creole"
        line: "(After asking about Earl) Earl ain't just any gator. He 's a prime specimen! Twenty-four feet of sun-eatin', tail-growin' perfection. His pen... busted  open. Them low-down Gator Grabbers, I reckon. Always tryin' to undercut honest folk. But...  there's somethin' odd. Tracks too heavy, and a strange... *slickness* left behind. Ain 't natural."

Flickering analog lights, humming generators, and the occasional  whir of tape drives create an eerie atmosphere.

    notes: |
      Inside the  labs, you'll encounter several Rogue Automatons. They are surprisingly tough and their 1970s aesthetic makes  them unsettlingly anachronistic. Fight or sneak your way through.

      - type : "Data-tapes"
        description: "(Playable on a chunky, reel-to-reel style  console) reveal the Automatons were part of an old bio-energy research project. They were programmed to acquire and utilize  large biological power sources. Big Earl, a solar-powered gator, is a perfect, if unintended, target."

post_quest_notes:
  internal_logic_considerations: 
    - modality: "Alethic Consistency"
      note: "The GE gator's solar power and the Automat ons' 1970s tech with advanced capabilities are central. The Automatons' power source and Big Earl's energy  draining should be visually and narratively consistent with the world's tech rules."
    - modality: "Deont ic/Axiological Impact"
      note: "The quest can reinforce the Automaton/LLM stigma.  The mom-and-pop farmer vs. mysterious advanced tech can play into themes of autonomy vs. automation. Mama Creole's faith  in local deities/celebrities could be invoked."
    - modality: "Epistemic Elements"
      note : "The truth about the Automatons is hidden, requiring investigation. The Swamp Witch and Ol' Man Cypress offer fragmented, folk- level knowledge, contrasting with the potential for more \"technical\" truth found in the labs. The \"Invisible Women\" conspiracy can  be subtly hinted at as a possible origin for the Automatons' reactivation."
    - modality: "Aesthetic Coherence"
       note: "All technology encountered (Automatons, lab equipment, Mama Creole's farm tech, player's potential tools)  must adhere to the late 1970s design aesthetic, creating a unique visual and functional challenge/flavor."
