  world: Primal Mama
  title: Bayou Blues and Bunny Bites
  codex_ version_reference: 0.1
  last_updated: "[Current Date]"
  lead_architects: "[Your  Name/Studio Name]"

  overview:
    logline: |
      A struggling mom-and-pop alligator ranch er near Lickskillet, Cletus Boggs, reports his prize GE Alligators are falling mysteriously ill –  becoming lethargic and unable to properly absorb solar energy. He fears sabotage or a new blight. The player must investigate  the cause, which leads them from strange bite marks to the eccentric Swamp Witch, "Old Mama" Bayou Bess, and  her unusual vampire bunnies, uncovering a bizarre ecological imbalance with a retro-tech, spiritual twist.
    core_themes :
      - "Unintended consequences of technology/magic"
      - "Ecological balance (or imbalance)"
      -  "Survival in a harsh world"
      - "The weirdness of the Primal Mama swamps"
    potential _player_actions_choices:
      - "Investigative methods (using 1970s- style diagnostic tools, tracking, talking to locals)."
      - "Interaction with Old Mama Bayou Bess (negotiation,  completing a task for her)."
      - "Dealing with the Vampire Bunny infestation (eradication, repellent, or a  more nuanced solution)."
      - "Reporting findings (and to whom, potentially affecting Cletus or Bess)."

   walkthrough:
    - step: 1
      title: "The Sick Gators of Cletus Bog gs"
      location: |
        Cletus Boggs's Alligator Ranch, a small, somewhat rundown series of  pens and solar charging stations on the outskirts of Lickskillet. The tech here is clearly 1970 s aesthetic, with chunky solar panels and analog readouts on the gator health monitors.
      introduction: |
         The player finds Cletus distressed. His biggest, best GE Alligators ("Burt Reynolds' Smile," " Jerry Reed's Revenge") are listless, their skin dull, and the solar charging indicators on their pens (large , blinking, analog dials) are barely moving.
      investigation:
        - "Player can use \"W itcher Senses\" (or a Primal Mama equivalent like \"Swamp Sense\" or a clunky 1 970s-style bio-scanner with a monochrome CRT display) to examine the gators."
        -  "Finds unusual, small, paired puncture wounds on the gators, often in less-armored spots."
         - "Gators' internal bio-batteries show minimal charge despite ample sunlight."
        - "Clet us might mention seeing more \"hyperactive swamp rabbits\" lately, but dismisses them. He might blame the \"Meat  Oligarchs from Beetriot\" for trying to poison his stock, or some \"new swamp fever brought on by them  invisible women.\""

    - step: 2
      title: "Following the Trail of Fluff and Fangs "
      tracking: |
        The player can find tufts of unusually dark fur and tiny, bloody footprints near the g ator pens.
      local_lore: |
        Asking around Lickskillet (perhaps at a dive bar with a  Gram Parsons tribute band playing) might yield whispers about "Old Mama" Bayou Bess and her "critters that ain' t right," or specifically, "vampire bunnies." Some might warn against seeking her out.
      discovery: | 
        The trail eventually leads to evidence of vampire bunnies preying on the alligators, perhaps a caught-in-the- act scene or a bunny den littered with traces of alligator bio-luminescent fluid (if solar gators have such a thing).

     - step: 3
      title: "Consulting \"Old Mama\" Bayou Bess"
      location: |
         A secluded, Cthulhu-goth-Southern style shack deep in the swamp, adorned with strange symbols , wind chimes made of bones and old tech components (flickering vacuum tubes, etc.).
      interaction:
         - "Bess is an ancient, enigmatic Erpenthrope (or just a very powerful, old Swamp Witch –  TBD which fits better for her power set). She's initially wary and speaks in riddles."
        -  "She confirms the vampire bunnies are hers (or at least, she \"encourages their strangeness\")."
        - " She explains the bunnies aren't drinking blood, but *bio-electrical solar charge*, a unique quirk of their vamp irism in this retro-futuristic, solar-powered world. This is why the gators are lethargic and can 't charge."
        - "She won't help directly unless the player does something for her."

    -  step: 4
      title: "The Swamp Witch's Errand"
      task: |
         Bess needs a rare, spiritually-charged component for one of her rituals/concoctions: "The Resonating Crystal from  the Sunken Chapel of St. Elvis the Wanderer." This chapel was an old pre-calamity structure, now partially  submerged in the swamp and reputedly haunted by the ghosts of its congregation who didn't appreciate Elvis's later Vegas  years.
      challenge: |
        The player must navigate the treacherous swamp, deal with environmental hazards (gas pockets , territorial non-GE gators), and confront/appease the ghosts in the Sunken Chapel using learned ritual magic (as  per the Alethic modality). The chapel itself might have a 1970s aesthetic overlay on its older  structure, due to post-calamity salvage attempts.

    - step: 5
      title: "The Cure  and the Choice"
      reward_from_bess:
        - "A recipe for \"Bunny-B -Gone Bayou Balm,\" a repellent made from swamp herbs and a minor charged solar capacitor (1970s style , of course)."
        - "Optionally, knowledge about *why* the bunnies started draining solar charge (perhaps  a shift in the swamp's spiritual miasma, or an experiment of hers gone awry)."
      application: |
         The player returns to Cletus and helps him synthesize and apply the balm to his gators and pen perimeters.
       potential_complication_choice: |
        Bess might offer a more "permanent" solution to the vampire bunny problem that  has ethically dubious implications (e.g., a ritual that harms the local swamp spirits, or a targeted bio-agent  that could spread).

    - step: 6
      title: "Resolution"
      outcome:
        -  "Cletus's alligators recover their charge and vitality. He's grateful and offers a reward (Caps , unique 70s-style gator-leather item, or a discount at his (future) Lickskillet  gator-steak stand)."
        - "The player's relationship with Old Mama Bayou Bess is established, potentially opening  up future interactions or quests."
        - "The local ecosystem is (temporarily) rebalanced."

  coherence_notes:
    al ethic_modalities:
      - "The quest heavily relies on the authenticated existence of GE Alligators (solar -powered), Vampire Bunnies, Swamp Witches, and Spectral Interaction."
      - "The \"sickness\" of  the alligators is a new state (lethargy due to solar drain) arising from the interaction of established entities,  consistent with the world's rules."
      - "The 1970s tech aesthetic is reinforced through C letus's ranch equipment, any diagnostic tools the player uses, and potentially components in Bess's rituals or the repellent ."
      - "The solution (Bunny-B-Gone Balm) involves a plausible (within Primal Mama's logic ) interaction of swamp alchemy and minor retro-tech (solar capacitor)."
    deontic_modalities:
       - "Cletus's struggle reflects the pressures on mom-and-pop operations, implicitly contrasting with the  meat oligarchy (though they are not direct antagonists here)."
      - "The need for the player to undertake dangerous  tasks for Bess aligns with the harsh realities and transactional nature often found in such isolated communities."
    axiological_modal ities:
      - "Alligator meat's value is central to Cletus's problem."
      -  "The esoteric knowledge of Swamp Witches is shown to be valuable (and comes at a price)."
      - "The 1 970s aesthetic is upheld in tech descriptions."
      - "The naming of Cletus's g ators after deified celebrities adds cultural flavor."
    epistemic_modalities:
      - "The initial  cause of the gator sickness is a mystery, requiring investigation."
      - "Swamp Witch Lore (held by Bess) is  crucial to understanding and solving the problem."
      - "Information from ghosts (in the Sunken Chapel) is necessary  to retrieve the quest item for Bess."
      - "Cletus's initial belief in conspiracies (\"invisible women,\"  oligarchy sabotage) reflects the cultural presence of such theories."
