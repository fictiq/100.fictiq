introduction: |
   This protocol guides the definition of quests within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Quests are complex narrative entities whose functional  properties emerge from the interaction of various world elements: character actions, object properties, environmental states, and the overarching modalities (Ale thic, Deontic, Axiological, Epistemic). This profile defines the quest's objectives, the  functional roles of entities involved, the necessary player actions (capabilities), and the potential outcomes based on the world's established  coherence.

  The aim is to ensure each quest is a logically sound and thematically resonant narrative sequence, drawing directly  from and reinforcing the unique bayou-infused, retro-futuristic, and strangely spiritual miasma of Primal Mama .

      - stage: 1
        name: The Gator Gripe
         objective: Speak to Cletus Bodine.
        player_functions: Dialogue with Cletus.
        world _interactions: "Cletus explains the gators' symptoms and his fears (economic ruin, meat oligarchy pressure )."
        modalities_invoked: 'Axiological (value of gators), Deontic (rules of gator  farming).'

      - stage: 2
        name: Scaly Symptoms
        objective: "Examine C letus's GE alligators and their enclosure."
        player_functions: "Use `Witcher S enses / Bayou Intuition` to find clues (odd residue on gators, discolored water in pens, unusual smell ). Optionally use `Retro-Chem Analysis` on water."
        world_interactions: "Affected gators are unresponsive . Clues point towards waterborne contamination originating upstream/deeper in the bayou."
        authenticated_details_ used: "GE Alligator physiology, Solar Dominance (failure to charge), 1970s Tech Aesthetic  (analysis kit)."

      - stage: 3
        name: Tracking the Trouble
        objective: Follow the  trail of contamination to its source.
        player_functions: "`Witcher Senses / Bayou Intuition` to follow  scent/residue trail through the swamp. May encounter minor hazards (Vampire Bunnies, territorial non-GE gators )."
        world_interactions: Trail leads to Murmur-Moss Mire and Mama Legba's distinctive hut and still. 
        authenticated_details_used: "Swamp Witch Lore (hermitage), Vampire Bunny Propagation (local fauna )."

      - stage: 4
        name: Meeting Mama Legba
        objective: Confront or speak with  Mama Legba.
        player_functions: |
          Dialogue with Mama Legba. Choice of approach:
           - Accusatory: May make her hostile or uncooperative.
          - Inquisitive/Respectful : More likely to yield information.
          - Offer Help: May open unique dialogue paths.
        world_interactions : "Mama Legba is initially wary. She reveals she's brewing a powerful \"Swamp Ward\" against the  \"invisible women\" (Epistemic: Conspiracy). She didn't realize it was affecting the GE gators, whose  biology is \"newfangled\" and \"unnatural\" to her. The brew or a key ingredient is the contaminant."
         modalities_invoked: "Epistemic (her knowledge vs. player's), Axiological (her belief in her ward  vs. Cletus's gators)."

      - stage: 5
        name: 'Brew Resolution (Branch ing Paths)'
        objective: Find a way to stop the contamination.
        player_functions_and_world _interactions:
          path_a_scientific_solution: |
            - Player uses `Retro-Chem Analysis` on  the brew (if not done before) or convinces Mama Legba for a sample.
            - Identifies the problematic  chemical/magical component.
            - Crafts/finds a neutralizing agent (e.g., "Solar-Katal yst Kompound" made with 70s-tech chemistry set, or a rare mineral).
            - Applies  neutralizer to the water source or convinces Mama Legba to add it to her brew.
          path_b_ natural_magical_solution: |
            - Player uses `Bayou Foraging` or knowledge from Mama Legba to find  a rare, non-toxic bayou herb ("Moonpetal Bloom") that can achieve a similar warding effect or neutralize  the current brew's toxicity.
            - Delivers herb to Mama Legba.
          path_c_ forceful_solution_negative_consequences: |
            - Player decides Mama Legba is too dangerous/un cooperative.
            - Sabotages/destroys her `Miasma Mixer` still.
             - Mama Legba becomes hostile (potential combat or curse). Contamination stops, but relationship ruined, possibly angering local  spirits or other witches.
        authenticated_details_used: "1970s Tech (crafting),  Swamp Witch Lore (alternative ingredients), \"Invisible Women\" conspiracy."

      - stage: 6

        world_interactions: |
          Cletus reports his gators are recovering. Pays reward.
           - If Mama Legba helped: Cletus is relieved, perhaps a little wary of witch-work.
           - If still destroyed: Cletus is happy gators are safe but might hear rumors of an angry witch.
         modalities_invoked: "Axiological (resolution of Cletus's problem)."

    costs _dependencies_and_operational_constraints:
      - constraint_id: 'QST_BB_01 _Time (Soft)'
        description: "Cletus's gators may get progressively weaker, implying urgency but not  a hard failure state."
      - constraint_id: 'QST_BB_01_Resources (Path  A/B)'
        description: Crafting neutralizer or finding rare herb requires specific components or successful foraging.
      -  constraint_id: 'QST_BB_01_Hostility (Path C)'
        description: " Destroying Mama Legba's still leads to combat or other negative repercussions from her or the swamp's spiritual ecosystem."

     potential_rewards:
      standard: "Gator Jerky, Solar-Cells, Local Currency (Oorang s? Bayou Bucks?)."
      path_a_b_bonus: "Mama Legba might offer a minor  charm, a unique recipe, or information."
      xp: XP
      reputation_change: Reputation change with L ickskillet locals / Swamp Witches.

    potential_consequences_failure_states:
      - "Failure to act : Gators may eventually die, Cletus ruined (impacting local economy/meat supply minimally)."
      - " Path C: Mama Legba becomes an enemy, possible bounty from a \"Witch Coven,\" or recurring environmental \" curses\" in the area. Player gains reputation as anti-magic or heavy-handed."
      - "Incorrectly  helping Mama Legba (e.g., giving her a *more* potent but still toxic ingredient by mistake): Gators  get worse, Cletus angry."

  quest_functional_profile_summary_and_narrative_role:
     core_functional_identity: "Bayou Brew Brouhaha functions as an investigative quest exploring the intersection of Primal  Mama's high-tech (GE gators) and esoteric (Swamp Witch magic) elements, driven by an environmental problem  with socio-economic undertones. It forces the player to engage with the unique logic and belief systems of the bayou inhabitants."
     key_narrative_functions_served:
      - "Worldbuilding: Introduces Swamp Witch culture, highlights  GE gator vulnerabilities, showcases local Lickskillet life."
      - "Character Interaction: Develops relationships with C letus and Mama Legba."
      - "Problem Solving: Offers multiple paths to resolution, testing different player skills /approaches."
      - "Thematic Exploration: Man vs. altered nature, tradition vs. \"progress,\"  unintended consequences, local beliefs (invisible women)."
    relationship_to_alethic_modality: "Tests  the limits of GE gator resilience and the power/reach of Swamp Witch concoctions. The 1970 s tech aesthetic dictates the *form* of any scientific analysis tools."
    key_functional_tensions_trade _offs:
      - Science vs. Magic in problem-solving.
      - "Helping Cletus vs. respecting /understanding Mama Legba's practices."
      - "Immediate solution (destroying still) vs. long- term consequences."
      - "The efficacy of Mama Legba's \"Swamp Ward\" vs. its side -effects."

  coherence_checks_internal_logic_validation_for_this_quest:
     alethic_consistency:
      - "Is it possible for a magical brew to affect GE gators? Yes , the calamity altered biology; GE is not infallible, and magical energies/substances could introduce unknown biochemical reactions."
       - "Can 1970s-style tech analyze magical substances? Partially. It might identify unusual non -magical components or energy signatures but fail to grasp the esoteric nature, leading to incomplete but useful data."
    deontic _consistency:
      - "Are there rules about brewing near gator farms? Perhaps local, unwritten ones.  Mama Legba might argue her remote location is \"far enough,\" not knowing the full reach of her brew's effects via  waterways."
    axiological_consistency:
      - "Does Cletus value his gators appropriately (as economic assets )? Yes."
      - "Does Mama Legba value her craft and beliefs (warding off invisible women)? Yes ."
      - "Do player choices reflect a spectrum of values (pragmatism, empathy, aggression)? Yes, through resolution  paths."
    epistemic_consistency:
      - "Is knowledge about the contaminant discoverable? Yes, through investigation and  NPC interaction."
      - "Is Mama Legba's knowledge (Swamp Witch Lore) consistent with her abilities  and the world's supernatural rules? Yes, she has specific, esoteric knowledge."
      - "Does the \" invisible women\" conspiracy motivate an NPC's actions believably? Yes, it provides a rationale for Mama Legba 's risky brewing."
