    title: "The Grotto's Guest Shack"
    description: |
      The game begins with a  humid languor—the kind that makes your skin slick before breakfast. Remy, our Erpenthrope protagonist, is  soaking in a reclaimed, algae-stained porcelain tub, its water heated by a sputtering solar coil array with chunky, 70 s-era bakelite controls. The air is thick with the scent of chicory coffee and swamp jasmine. Peace,  however, is fleeting.

      A sudden, sharp nip at his... well, his *lower regions*, yanks  him from his reverie. It's not a gator, thankfully, but one of Mama Mambo's  damned Vampire Bunnies, its eyes glowing faintly red in the dim light of the shack. The Swamp Witch herself emerges from the shadows,  a wry smile playing on her lips beneath a wide-brimmed hat adorned with ethically sourced bird skulls and blinking LED  lights (70s style, of course).
    dialogue:
      - character: Mama Mambo
        line:  "Still jumpy as a frog on a hot plate, *cher*?"
      - character: Mama Mambo
        line : "You need to be sharper if you're gonna keep that P'tit Gator from becoming gator bait. Old Man Bayou  says the young'un's got more spirit than sense."

      She proceeds to give Remy  a piece of her mind about P'tit Gator's "unorthodox" training methods (apparently involving too much reliance  on salvaged tech and not enough on primal instinct), the two share a terse exchange while Remy towels off with a threadbare towel embroidered with  a faded Burt Reynolds silhouette. Time to face the muggy day.

    title: Find the Security Fob
     description: |
      Or rather, the game's tutorial begins. Your first task is to find the security fob  for the shack's reinforced door. Remy, ever cautious of swamp pirates or overzealous Lickskillet revenuers, always  locks it. Aside from pointlessly flicking the chunky toggle switches on a non-functional pre-Calamity wall  panel (pure 70s wood grain) and examining various jars of pickled swamp oddities (getting some gruff commentary from Remy  and some mystical aphorisms from Mama Mambo), there's not much else to it.
    objective_ item_location: "In the north-western corner of the shack, nestled within a tattered copy of “Solar Power for Swamp  Survivalists: 1978 Edition” on a table cluttered with alligator-tooth carving tools, you'll find your way ward fob."
    tutorial_mechanic:
      name: Erpenthrope Senses
      button: L2
       description: "Hold that button down, and the world shifts – important objects pulse with a faint, internal bio-luminescence , spectral traces of recent activity shimmer in the air, and you might even hear the faint whispers of ambient spirits (a  known perk of the permeable veil). In this case, the fob we need glows with a comforting, low-tech green ."
    action_to_take: "Grab it (a satisfying *clunk* as it detaches from  its magnetic charger) and approach the door."
    door_opening_tutorial: "Yes, the game even gives you a tutorial  for opening reinforced swamp doors. Turns out you have to face them and press [X] on the chunky, oversized keypad. Who knew  security could be so… analog?"

    type : game_note
    content: "Note: All directions will be given in relation to your wrist-mounted \" Bayou Navigator\" (a bulky, 70s-style LED display device). It’s a pretty nifty  piece of salvaged tech that’ll make both our lives easier in this confusing swampland."

    type: scene_transition
    description: |
      Unlock  the door and swagger out onto the Grotto's main deck, Remy-style (which involves a certain hip-swaying  saunter necessary for navigating uneven swamp terrain). Once on the main platform, constructed from weathered planks and salvaged industrial grating, Remy  will note that his elder mentor—Old Man Bayou—who was supposed to be supervising P'tit Gator's morning  drills, has clearly failed. Instead of some tedious solar panel maintenance or alligator lure whittling, P'tit Gator  is down on the lower dock, precariously balanced on a tilting oil drum, trying to "hypnotize" a  juvenile, genetically engineered alligator with a spinning hubcap while Old Man Bayou snoozes soundly in a patched-up  lawn chair, a battered copy of "The Sermons of Jerry Reed" resting on his chest.

      After some grumbled pleasantries with a now-awakening (and slightly embarrassed)  Old Man Bayou, Remy heads down to the lower dock to speak with the overeager youngster.
