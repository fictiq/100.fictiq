  overview: |
    Mama Agnes, a grizzled but kind-hearted independent gator farmer  on the outskirts of Lickskillet, is in a bind. Her prize breeding GE Alligator, "Sparky," has  stopped absorbing solar energy efficiently and has become dangerously erratic. If Sparky can't be fixed, Mama Agnes could lose  her farm, a fate made more likely by the ever-present "friction" from the Beetriot-based meat processor  oligarchies eager to swallow up small operations. The player is tasked with investigating the cause of Sparky's ailment and, if possible , repairing the magnificent beast or its associated technology, all while navigating the unique technological and societal constraints of Primal Mama. 

  initiation:
    triggers:
      - 'The player can overhear worried whispers in Lickskillet about  Mama Agnes''s troubles.'
      - "The player might stumble upon Mama Agnes's farm and see her distress ."
      - 'A notice board post (stylized, of course, with 70s fonts) could request  "Tech-Savvy Help, Gator Experience a Plus!"'

      character: ' Mama Agnes'
      text: |
        "Sweet tea and sunshine, stranger. If you got a lick o ' sense 'bout these newfangled GE gators and a bit o' kindness, ol' Mama Agnes could sure  use a hand. My Sparky... he ain't himself. And if Sparky goes, this whole place goes with him,  straight into the gullet of them Beetriot fat cats."

  stepsAndObjectives:
    - step:  1
      title: 'Talk to Mama Agnes'
      details: |
        - Learn about Sparky's symptoms:  lethargy, followed by aggressive outbursts, skin mottling (indicating chromatophore/solar absorption issues).
        - Learn  about Sparky's value as a breeding stud.
        - Mama Agnes suspects a critical component failure but lacks the  advanced diagnostic tools (or the approved 70s-aesthetic versions of them).
    - step: 2 
      title: "Investigate Sparky's Enclosure"
      details: |
        - Player must  approach Sparky's pen cautiously. Sparky might be hostile.
        - Using "Primal Senses"  (World's equivalent of Witcher Senses):
          - Notice unusual ozone smell near Sparky's preferred basking  spot. (Alethic: Advanced tech often has distinct byproducts)
          - Identify scorch marks on the  ground or pen infrastructure near a solar charging interface.
          - 'Observe Sparky''s skin: The advanced chromatophores are  flickering erratically or are dull. (Alethic: GE Gator property)'
          - Find a shed, unusually thick sc ute or a fragment of a damaged component near the solar interface.
    - step: 3
      title:  'Diagnose the Problem'
      details: |
        - 'Based on clues, the player deduces the  issue likely lies with Sparky''s external solar regulator unit or its direct interface with his bio-circuitry. This unit , while advanced internally, is housed in a chunky, wood-paneled 1970s-style casing. (Ale thic: Tech Aesthetic Constraint)'
        - Mama Agnes might have a basic diagnostic tool (looking like a 7 0s multimeter with an oscilloscope display) which confirms a power surge or regulation failure.
    - step: 4 
      title: 'Retrieve/Repair the Damaged Component'
      options:
        - type: 'Repair  (Option A)'
          details: |
            - 'The player needs to acquire specific parts to repair the regulator ( e.g., oversized capacitors, specialized vacuum tubes, a specific type of conductive wiring that meets the 70s aesthetic ).'
            - These could be scavenged from old, discarded tech in the Lickskillet boneyard.
            -  'Purchased from a quirky, backwater tech-scrapper in Lickskillet (who only deals in "vintage"  70s-style parts).'
            - Possibly involving a mini-game to solder/reassemble the chunky components  correctly.
        - type: 'Replace (Option B)'
          details: |
            - 'The regulator  is fried beyond field repair. Mama Agnes might know of a spare, or one that can be "acquired" from a  less-than-reputable source, or even from a derelict, forgotten pre-calamity research outpost deep in the  swamp (requiring a journey).'
            - 'This could lead to a confrontation with scavengers or even low- level enforcers of a rival operation if the component is "borrowed."'
    - step: 5
       title: '(Potential Complication) Sabotage?'
      details: |
        - 'While investigating or repairing, the player  might find evidence of deliberate tampering (e.g., a non-standard tool mark, a deliberately cut wire that looks  different from accidental damage, a faint trace of a chemical not usually found on the farm).'
        - 'This could  be a subtle hint from the meat oligarchy, or a desperate local rival. This thread could be minor or lead to  a follow-up. (Epistemic: Conspiracy potential)'
    - step: 6
      title: 'Install/ Activate the Repaired/Replaced Component'
      details: |
        - The player needs to carefully approach Sparky ( who may still be agitated) to re-attach the regulator or interface.
        - 'A successful skill check ( e.g., "Tech-Fixin''" or "Critter Calm") might be needed.'
        - ' Alternatively, Mama Agnes might have a ritualistic way of calming Sparky using local herbs and a deified celebrity''s  "lucky charm" (e.g., a Burt Reynolds replica mustache). (Alethic: Spectral/Spiritual elements )'
    - step: 7
      title: "Observe Sparky's Recovery"
      details:  |
        - Sparky's chromatophores begin to glow steadily.
        - His behavior normalizes.
         - He basks and visibly absorbs solar energy.
    - step: 8
      title: 'Report  to Mama Agnes'
      details: |
        - 'Receive reward (Crowns, unique gator jerky recipe, a  70s-style decorative item for player''s dwelling, reputation increase in Lickskillet).'
        -  If sabotage was found, Mama Agnes might offer a new quest or a warning.
