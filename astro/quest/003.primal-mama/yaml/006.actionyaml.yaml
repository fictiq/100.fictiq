introduction: >
  This protocol guides the definition of quests within the Primal Mama heteroc osm.
  Applying DoleÅ¾el's concepts of functional properties, a quest is treated as a narrative entity
  with its  own potential for action (player progression), interaction (with world systems and NPCs),
  and influence (on the game  state and character development). This protocol focuses on
  **authenticating** the quest's objectives, steps, constraints , and outcomes, ensuring they align
  with Primal Mama's established modalities and unique bayou-infused,  retro-futuristic,
  and strangely spiritual miasma. The goal is to define not just *what* the  player does,
  but *how* those actions fit into the world's logic, *what challenges* ( limitations, costs,
  constraints) they face, and *what meaningful impact* their success or failure has, 
  consistent with the world's internal rules.

        text: > 
          Investigate the cause of a mysterious and aggressive "bloom" (algal, fungal, or otherwise)
          that is  choking out native swamp flora, sickening local fauna (including smaller GE Alligators),
          and threatening the livelihood of L ickskillet's mom-and-pop gator operations.

        text: > 
          Discover a means to halt or reverse the blight. Expose any responsible parties if the blight
          is man -made. Potentially secure a more stable future for Lickskillet's ecosystem.

      - capability_id: FUNC-BBB-01
        name: Initial Investigation & Sample Collection 
        description: >
          Player talks to Mama Griswold, observes afflicted GE gators/pens.
           Uses "Primal Senses" (world's Witcher Sense equivalent) to track the blight's
          spread  from affected areas, identify hotspots, and collect samples of blighted flora,
          water, and possibly tissue from affected  small creatures. Samples are collected
          in 1970s-style, chunky specimen jars.
         authentication: Visual cues, interactive objects, basic survival/tracking skills.
        limits_nuances: Initial search area might be  broad. Some samples might be in hazardous (toxic or creature-infested) zones.
      - capability_id: FUNC- BBB-02
        name: Expert Consultation & Analysis
        description: |
          Player takes samples to one  or more local "experts" for analysis within the world's 1970s tech/mystic framework :
          1.  **Herbalist Silas (Lickskillet):** A reclusive but respected local  with a makeshift lab full of bubbling beakers, analog dials, and wood-paneled 'analyzers'. He can  perform basic biological/chemical tests (within the 1970s aesthetic).
          2.  **Sw amp Witch Agnes (Deep Bayou - Optional):** If Silas's mundane methods fail or suggest something unnatural, player might  seek out Agnes. She might identify magical or "unnatural" life-force signatures in the blight. Getting her help involves navigating her  eccentricities and possibly dealing with her vampire bunnies.
          3.  **Erpenthrope "Scales"  (Whispering Reeds - Optional/Advanced):** If the blight seems profoundly 'untrue' or tied to deeper  ecological imbalance, an Erpenthrope might offer cryptic insights, perhaps sensing a distortion related to the original Calamity  or a profound lie.
        authentication: Dialogue choices, persuasion checks (Axii-equivalent or social skill), item hand-overs .
        limits_nuances: "Each expert may offer different perspectives/leads. Agnes may require a strange favor  (e.g., a \"perfectly sun-ripened\" toadstool). Scales is elusive and speaks in riddles about  \"truth\" and \"natural law.\""
      - capability_id: FUNC-BBB-03
         name: Tracing the Source (Path Dependent)
        description: |
          Based on expert consultation, the player follows leads: 
          1.  **Industrial Contamination:** If Silas suspects chemicals, tracks might lead upstream to a hidden GatorCorp  waste pipe or an old, forgotten dumping ground (perhaps using a clunky, 1970s-style  geiger counter-esque "toxin detector"). Evidence might be on a discarded, oversized floppy disk or punch-card  printout from a GatorCorp facility.
          2.  **Supernatural Origin:** If Agnes suspects magical interference or  an elemental imbalance, the source might be a desecrated shrine to a Bayou spirit, a botched ritual site, or a place where the  veil to the spectral world is thin.
          3.  **Calamity Echo:** If Scales hints at deeper  roots, the source could be a dormant bio-agent from the Calamity, now reawakened, perhaps in  a geologically unstable or heavily mutated part of the swamp.
        authentication: Primal Senses tracking, environmental puzzles , confronting minor antagonists (GatorCorp security bots styled like 1970s sci-fi robots, territorial  blighted creatures).
        limits_nuances: "The true source might be obscured by red herrings or local  conspiracy theories (e.g., \"It's them invisible women again!\")."
      - capability_id : FUNC-BBB-04
        name: Implementing a Solution (Path Dependent)
        description: |
           Based on the identified source:
          1.  **Industrial:** Expose GatorCorp (present evidence to a  sympathetic local official, or incite Lickskillet residents). Sabotage the source (e.g., using a crafted  explosive with a chunky timer to seal a pipe).
          2.  **Supernatural:** Perform a cleansing ritual ( with Agnes's guidance, requiring specific components like "Ghost-touched Cypress Bark" or "Solar-Charged Gator Scale Fragment").  Appease an angered spirit.
          3.  **Calamity Echo:** Find/synthesize a natural counter-agent ( Silas might devise a formula using rare swamp herbs that needs to be dispersed via a jury-rigged 1970 s crop-duster fan-boat).
        authentication: Crafting, ritual minigames, dialogue challenges, combat  encounters.
        limits_nuances: Solutions may not be permanent or might have unintended side-effects. GatorCorp might retali ate. Rituals can be dangerous.

  functional_profile_summary_narrative_role:
    core_quest_identity : >
      The Bayou Bloom Blight tasks the player with acting as an ecological detective and savior
      for the  Lickskillet community. It blends investigation through "Primal Senses,"
      interaction with quirky local experts (operating within  1970s tech/mystic frameworks),
      and problem-solving that could range from exposing corporate greed to engaging  in bayou folk magic.
      The quest highlights the precarious balance of Primal Mama's ecosystem and the resilience 
      of its inhabitants.
    key_narrative_functions_served:
      - "Worldbuilding: Deepens understanding  of Lickskillet, the bayou ecosystem, local beliefs, and the tension between mom-and-pop operations and Gator Corp."
      - "Character Interaction: Introduces memorable local characters like Mama Griswold, Herbalist Silas, and  potentially Swamp Witch Agnes or an Erpenthrope."
      - "Thematic Exploration: Touches on themes of environmentalism  (Primal Mama style), corporate responsibility (or lack thereof), the clash between folk wisdom/magic and rudimentary science,  and community resilience."
      - "Player Agency: Offers multiple investigation paths and solution types, allowing player choices to have  tangible impacts on the local area and its people."
    relationship_to_alethic_modality:
       - Tests the limits of the GE Alligators' resilience to environmental change.
      - Explores the possibility of lingering effects from  the Biological Calamity.
      - Validates (or challenges) the authenticated capabilities of Swamp Witch magic or Er penthrope insight.
      - Operates within the constraint that technology (even for analysis/solutions) must conform  to the 1970s aesthetic, influencing *how* problems are solved.
    key_functional_ tensions_trade_offs:
      - "Mundane vs. Supernatural Explanations: Player must decide which leads  to pursue and which experts to trust, potentially navigating conflicting information."
      - "Direct Confrontation vs. Subtle Solutions : When dealing with GatorCorp or other powerful entities, does the player risk open conflict or find a less direct way to  achieve their goals?"
      - "Community Good vs. Personal Cost: Some solutions might require significant personal risk or resource  expenditure from the player."
      - "Truth vs. Expediency: Is it more important to find the absolute  root cause, or to implement a quick fix that helps Lickskillet survive, even if the deeper problem remains?"
