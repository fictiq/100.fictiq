introduction:
  title: 'Craft ing Narratively Coherent Experiences'
  text: |
    This protocol guides the definition of quests within the Pr imal Mama heterocosm, ensuring they align with the world's established **internal coherence** and leverage its unique ** modalities** (Alethic, Deontic, Axiological, Epistemic). A quest, in this  context, is a complex entity with functional properties: it has objectives (purpose), involves player actions (capabilities), presents challenges  (limitations/constraints), and impacts the world-state or character understanding.

    Focus on **authenticating** these functional  aspects clearly and consistently. Define not just *what* the quest is about, but *how* it unfolds, under  *what world conditions*, what *player actions* are key, and crucially, how it reflects and reinforces the established truths  of Primal Mama's bayou-infused, retro-futuristic, and strangely spiritual miasma.

  quest_profile _summary_narrative_role:
    core_functional_identity: |
      Gator Bait Blues functions  as an introductory investigation into the struggles of Lickskillet's independent alligator farmers. The player acts as a detective  and problem-solver, utilizing observational skills, swampcraft, and interaction with Primal Mama's unique 19 70s-aesthetic technology to track a prized GE Alligator, "Big Earl." The quest's progression is defined by uncovering  clues, overcoming environmental and potentially human-made obstacles, and making choices that can affect the outcome for Mama Agnes and Big  Earl.
    key_narrative_functions_served:
      - 'Worldbuilding: Showcases the L ickskillet environment, the GE alligator economy, the 1970s tech aesthetic in practical use, and the oppressive influence  of the meat oligarchy.'
      - 'Conflict Introduction: Directly introduces the "friction" between mom-and-pop farmers  and the oligarchy, potentially setting up future plotlines.'
      - 'Gameplay Introduction: Orients players to investigation , tracking, and interaction with Primal Mama''s specific technological and environmental rules.' # Escaped quote
      - " Moral/Ethical Choice (Potential): Depending on the cause of disappearance, player might face choices regarding how to deal with  desperate rivals or how to expose oligarchy misdeeds (e.g., if saboteurs are other struggling farmers, or  if exposing oligarchy is too risky for Agnes)."
    relationship_to_foundational_modalities:
      Ale thic: "The quest operates on the established possibilities of GE alligators (solar power, size), their potential vulnerabilities,  the pervasiveness of 1970s tech, and the realities of the bayou environment."
       Deontic: "Explores the impact of the meat oligarchy's power (implied permission for their actions vs. prohibition  for others), the rules of the Saurian Sanctuary (if applicable), and the potential social/legal fallout if forbidden Automaton/LL M tech is involved."
      Axiological: "Highlights the value of prized GE alligators to independent farmers, the  cultural adherence to the 1970s aesthetic (even in illicit devices), and potentially the conflict between community well-being and  corporate greed. May touch on the value of \"truth\" if the player uncovers a conspiracy."
      Epistemic:  "The player's primary role is to uncover knowledge – the \"truth\" of Big Earl's disappearance. This  might involve sifting through Agnes's beliefs/suspicions, physical evidence, and potentially misleading information."
     key_functional_tensions_trade_offs:
      - "Mama Agnes's desperation vs. limited resources to  investigate."
      - "Player's need for information vs. dangers of the bayou/antagonists."
       - "Retrieving Big Earl quickly vs. thoroughly investigating the cause (potential for greater justice vs. immediate need)."
      -  "Exposing wrongdoing (e.g., by oligarchy) vs. personal/Agnes's safety."
       - "Upholding local law/norms vs. achieving a \"just\" outcome if they conflict."
