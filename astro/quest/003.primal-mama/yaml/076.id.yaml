    level_equivalent: 24
     codex_integration_note: "Having likely navigated the treacherous waterways and perhaps dealt with some local \"friction\" from  the meat processor oligarchs, the PC might hear whispers of a powerful, reclusive figure known for unique bio-alchemy  and perhaps insights into the world's stranger elements."

        description: 'Fast-travel via airboat to the  "''Gator Boneyard'' Dock". Follow a nearly overgrown path south-west through cypress knees and stagnant pools  until you find a strangely well-maintained shack built into the roots of a colossal, petrified tree. Outside, puttering with  strange, bubbling contraptions housed in 70s-style casings, is "Doc" Thibodeaux, a master bio -tinkerer spoken of in hushed tones.'

        description: "Approach  Doc Thibodeaux. He's initially dismissive, wary of outsiders interrupting his work (which blends advanced bio- science with what looks suspiciously like folk hoodoo). If the PC persists, expressing genuine interest in his craft (or perhaps  offering rare components), Thibodeaux might offer tutelage... but only if the PC retrieves three rare items essential for his current \" Project Roux\":\n1. A sealed jug of authentic \"Swamp Lightning\" Moonshine from a notoriously haunted still .\n2. A sample of living \"Catahoula Nightshade\", a bioluminescent fungus that only grows in  deep, creature-infested caves.\n3. Convince \"Bayou Boss Fontaine\", a respected (and feared)  community leader downstream, to perform a specific appeasement ritual – Fontaine owes Thibodeaux a favor, but is notoriously stubborn.\ nAgreeing kicks off a new round of swamp exploration, delving deeper into the bayou's secrets and dangers."
