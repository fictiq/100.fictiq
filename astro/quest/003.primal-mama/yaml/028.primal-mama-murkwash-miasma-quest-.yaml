introduction_title: 'Introduction: Defining Dynamic Potential  Through Authentication'
introduction_text: |
  This protocol guides the definition of the **functional properties** of entities  within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following Doležel, these properties define an entity's potential for action,  interaction, and influence within the world's established rules (modalities). They encompass **capabilities (abilities, skills,  powers)** as well as crucial **limitations (weaknesses, costs, constraints, inabilities)**.

  Focus on **authent icating** these functions clearly and consistently. Define not just *what* an entity can do, but *how*, under  *what conditions*, at *what cost*, and crucially, *what it cannot do*. These properties are essential for narrative  mechanics, conflict generation, character agency, and world coherence.

      primary_role:
        description: 'Player investigates the disruption of GE Alligator behavior in the MurkWash  Delta at the behest of Mama Manchet, a local Swamp Witch, who needs a pristine Solar-Charged Gator Gizzard  for a potent ritual. The quest explores the interaction of advanced GE, retro-tech, and supernatural elements.'

      secondary_roles:
        description: 'Introduces the player  to the unique ecology and hazards of the MurkWash Delta. Potentially uncovers a relic of forgotten technology or evidence  of covert oligarchy activity. Offers choices affecting local swamp denizens and potentially Mama Manchet''s standing.'

      capabilities:
         - capability_id: FUNC-QMMM-01
          name: 'Investigation & Clue Discovery'
          description : 'Player utilizes their senses (and potentially basic 1970s-style scanning equipment provided or found)  to uncover clues about the gators'' distress: unusual energy readings, physical symptoms on gators (e.g.,  malfunctioning solar chromatophores, erratic behavior), environmental anomalies (e.g., strange hum, localized energy fields, odd plant  growth).'
          authentication: 'World''s allowance for investigation; 1970s tech aesthetic implies analog  readouts/scanners.'
          limits_nuances: 'Clues may be subtle or require specific conditions ( e.g., time of day for energy readings, specific gator behaviors). Scanners might be unreliable or have limited  range/functionality due to the 1970s aesthetic constraint.'
        - capability_id: FUNC -QMMM-02
          name: 'NPC Interaction & Information Gathering'
          description: 'Player interacts  with Mama Manchet (quest giver), potentially other swamp dwellers (e.g., reclusive trappers, other minor  witches), or even Erpenthropes if they are drawn to the "truth" of the disturbance. Dialogue choices can yield more  or less information, or alter NPC disposition.'
          authentication: 'Authenticated existence of Swamp Witches, Erpenthropes , and general populace.'
          limits_nuances: 'NPCs may be distrustful, cryptic, or have their own  agendas. Swamp Witch lore might be esoteric and hard to decipher. Erpenthropes might only reveal certain truths.' 
        - capability_id: FUNC-QMMM-03
          name: 'Problem Solving (Technological /Supernatural Interface)'
          description: 'Player must identify the source of the gator disruption – an old, malfunctioning  "Aetheric Wave Modulator" (conforming to 1970s aesthetic: wood paneling, chunky  dials, Nixie tube displays) – and determine how to neutralize or repair it. This might involve understanding its retro-tech interface  or using ritualistic means to counter its esoteric energy leakage if it''s become "haunted" or strangely energized.'
          authentication : 'Technological Aesthetic Constraint, Spectral Interaction possibility, Solar Dominance (implying advanced energy tech that could go wrong).'
           limits_nuances: 'Repairing the Modulator might require rare 1970s-era components or  specific technical knowledge. Ritualistic neutralization might require ingredients gathered from the swamp or knowledge from Mama Manchet/ghosts.'
         - capability_id: FUNC-QMMM-04
          name: 'Combat & Hazard Navigation'
           description: 'Player may face glitched/aggressive GE Alligators, other mutated swamp creatures affected by the Modulator''s mi asma, or even automated defenses if the Modulator is an oligarchy experiment. The MurkWash Delta itself presents environmental  hazards (e.g., toxic zones from the miasma, treacherous terrain).'
          authentication: 'GE Alligators'' capabilities , potential for unknown biological effects from the calamity/rogue tech.'
          limits_nuances: 'Glitched g ators might have unpredictable attack patterns or resistances. The miasma might require protective gear (improvised 1970s style ) or have debilitating effects.'
        - capability_id: FUNC-QMMM-05
          name:  'Ethical/Factional Choice Point'
          description: 'Player decides what to do with the Modulator once  found: Destroy it? Repair it for Mama Manchet (if she has a use for its controlled output)? Report its  existence to the Erpenthropes (truth-seekers) or a rival Meat Oligarchy faction? Each choice has consequences .'
          authentication: 'Authenticated values of Erpenthropes (truth), potential for oligarchy machinations.' 
          limits_nuances: 'Destroying it might anger someone. Repairing it could be dangerous. Reporting it could trigger wider  conflict.'

    core_functional_identity: 'The MurkWash Modulator Mias ma functions as an investigative mystery steeped in Primal Mama''s unique bio-punk Southern Gothic. It challenges the player to diagnose and  resolve a technological/supernatural ailment affecting GE Alligators, using observation, interaction with eccentric NPCs, retro-tech problem -solving, and combat, all while navigating a hazardous bayou environment.'

      - 'Risking combat with glitched alligators/other hazards vs. stealth y investigation.'
      - 'The material benefit from Mama Manchet vs. the potential ethical implications of the chosen solution for the Mod ulator.'
