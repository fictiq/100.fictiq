    location: "Gene's Shack, Lickskillet  Outskirts"
    introduction: >
      The game begins with a steamy, humid quiet – the kind only  a deep bayou morning can offer.
      Our hero, "Gator" Gene, an Erpenthrope  known for his resilience and unsettlingly calm demeanor,
      is trying to enjoy a lukewarm mug of chicory substitute in  his cluttered, 70s-panelled shack…
      Until a surprisingly aggressive Vampire Bunny, likely a " gift" from his associate, Mama Mambo,
      nips his ankle. She materializes from the shadows, a C thulhu-goth vision in moss and bone trinkets,
      and proceeds to chastise him about not properly training L 'il Bit, their young Erpenthrope ward.
      The two exchange some terse words, pull on their  patched-up denim and pleather, and a typical day
      in post-Calamity Lickskillet begins. 
    tutorial_start: >
      Or rather, the game's tutorial begins. Your first task is to find  the **Shed Key** for the
      door to the gator-pen out back, which Gene wisely keeps locked to prevent  any prize solar-gators
      from wandering off or, worse, L'il Bit from trying to "ride " one. Aside from pointlessly
      flicking chunky plastic switches on defunct Pre-Calamity appliances and examining  various
      alligator skulls and strange swamp relics for some commentary from Gene and Mama Mambo,
      there's  not much to do. In the north-western corner of the room, on a worn copy of
      "B urt Reynolds' Guide to Bayou Livin'" resting on an orange formica-topped crate near the door,
       you'll find the wayward key. Of course, you're supposed to be trying out your "Erp enthrope Senses"
      **[L2/LT]**. Hold that button down, and if you' ve ever seen a gator track its prey through
      murky water, you'll understand the purpose – it highlights interactable  objects and faint trails.
      In this case, the **Shed Key** glows with a faint, swampy  aura. Grab it and open the door.
      Yes, the game even gives you a tutorial for opening doors.  Turns out you have to face them
      and press **[X/A]**. Who knew?
    map _note: "Note: All directions will be given in relation to the mini-map's compass rose. It 's a pretty nifty tool, cobbled together from old dashboard parts, that'll make both our lives easier."
     next_steps: >
      Unlock the door and saunter outside, Gene-style. Once in the humid  yard, Gene will note
      that Old Man Croaker – a wizened elder Erpenthrope who was supposed to be schooling  L'il Bit
      in advanced solar-gator maintenance – has failed at his duties. Instead of some dull
      sche matic reading, L'il Bit decided to terrorize some repurposed scarecrows with a rusty
      machete while Cro aker caught forty winks on a pile of Spanish moss. After some gruff words
      with Croaker, Gene heads over to  chastise the young aspiring Erpenthrope. After chatting
      with L'il Bit for a bit, she'll ask  if you want to "run the rigs," which is a handy,
      more in-depth tutorial covering basic mobility  in Lickskillet's treacherous,
      stilt-supported environment.
    sub_sections:
       - sub_section_title: "Running the Rigs"
        description: >
          If you chose to " run the rigs," start out by heading west and climbing a rickety ladder **[X/A]**
           onto a walkway made of old tires and corrugated metal, then scale two stacked oil drums to the
          north **[Circle/B ]** and climb onto a tilted water tower to the west. Drop off a ledge to the
          north (onto a pile  of discarded vinyl records), then another to the south before climbing down
          a knotted rope ladder to the east. Head down some  muddy stairs to the south and climb down
          another ladder, then navigate some wooden walkways over bubbling bog to the west, going down 
          two more flights of decaying stairs and another ladder. Once all this is done, your goal is to
          head east  into a sunken, algae-choked courtyard to find Old Man Croaker, who is waiting with
          Roux and Beaux,  two other local Erpenthropes.
        layout_note: "Note: Lickskillet seems to have retained at  least some of its pre-Calamity shantytown layout. A cool touch, showing how little some things change." 
        combat_training_intro: >
          Croaker will give L'il Bit the "back in my day, we  respected our elders and didn't try to
          solar-charge gators with a car battery" speech before finally  moving on to combat training.
          Accept the tutorial if you wish to learn more about combat (why wouldn't  you?) or pass.
      - sub_section_title: "The Fundamentals of Swamp Scrappin'"
         steps:
          - step_description: >
              Choose to "start with the fundamentals" and Gene will grab his  trusty **Machete**.
              The game will briefly introduce you to the three basic tools of a Primal Mama  survivor:
              blades, Erpenthrope abilities, and swamp concoctions. For now, we're  focusing on blades.
              Press **[Left D-Pad]** to quick-draw your **Machete ** (useful for fighting mutated
              swamp critters and less scrupulous humans, who tend to be clad in scavenged junk ).
              Your **Bio-Lash** (a specialized weapon for dealing with more heavily mutated or
              spectral  threats) **[Right D-Pad]** will come into play later when we're hunting
              creatures  truly warped by the Calamity or the Bayou's strange energies.
          - step_description: >
               Once your Machete is out, lock onto Croaker by pressing down on the **[R3/RS ]** button,
              then perform a series of Fast Attacks **[Square/X]**, followed by Strong Attacks  **[Triangle/Y]**.
              Next up, dodging **[Circle/B]**. Croaker gives ample  warning before he swings his walking
              stick (surprisingly quick for an old fella), so you should have no trouble scoring  the
              two dodges this task requires. Next, you'll need to roll out of the way twice ** [X/A]**,
              which is more of the same, except Croaker's telegraphed  "attacks" are even more obvious.
              What's the difference? Dodges are shorter and faster, best  for evading quick lunges and
              retaliating. Rolls are good for evading heavy, slower attacks or  repositioning.
              Parrying is the next order of business – simply hold down **[L2/LT] ** to parry all of
              Croaker's (gentle) stick-swats. Finally, it's  time to practice ripostes. Hit **[L2/LT]**
              just as Croaker attacks to  block-and-counter him.
          - step_description: >
              Now it's time to move  onto **Erpenthrope Abilities**. Press **[L1/LB]** to open the
              Quick Access  Menu, from which you can select your abilities. The first up is **Scale Shield**.
              Select it, then  cast it by pressing **[R2/RT]**. Scale Shield temporarily hardens Gene's
              hide, absorbing a degree  of damage, and is eminently useful for mitigating unexpected blows.
              Cast it and let Croaker whack you – to  no effect. Then switch to the **Spitfire** ability,
              which projects a short burst of corrosive/ fiery bile at your foe, handy for harming or
              startling a group of weaker foes, or perhaps setting  some flammable swamp gas alight.
              Next up is **Bayou Charm**, which Gene can use to briefly befuddle or intimidate  foes.
              It's also handy for getting a better price from a stingy scrap dealer or avoiding a
              point less brawl. Last up is **Mud Trap**, which creates a patch of supernaturally
              sticky mud on the ground that slows  enemies who enter.
          - step_description: >
              Blades and Erpenthrope abilities are done , which leaves only **Swamp Concoctions**.
              First up are bombs. Press **[L1/LB]**  again and access the lower half of your radial menu,
              which contains equipped concoctions (potions, bombs, oils). Select  the **Swamp Gas Bomb**,
              then chuck one at Croaker **[R1/RB]** ( don't worry, it's a dud for training). Then head
              to the selected spot and toss some more bombs at  some training dummies (old tires on sticks),
              this time holding down **[R1/RB]** to  free-aim with the 70s-style targeting reticle.
        free_training: >
           You can now freely train with Croaker, and it's nice to have the kid gloves off.
          Practice dodging , countering, attacking... all that good stuff. The training ends when
          you sheathe your Machete. After  an unsettling intrusion from a flock of Vampire Bunnies
          seemingly summoned by Mama Mambo, so does the dream-tutorial  in which all this occurred.
  - section_title: "Mud Puddle Mysteries: The Search for Mama Mambo"
     location: "Outskirts of Lickskillet, Primal Mama Swamplands"
    introduction: > 
      Gene will wake up with a jolt, and the old Erpenthrope, Croaker, will start grumbling at  him.
      Either reveal the details of your dream-tutorial, or grunt noncommittally. Afterwards, the two
       will decide to head out. According to a chewed-up, mud-stained note Gene found, delivered by a
      str angely intelligent marsh rat (Mama Mambo's preferred messenger), their destination was the
      outskirts of Beetriot, a  rendezvous somewhat complicated by the fact that the route was recently
      overrun by newly aggressive "Bayou Biters"  – mutated swamp life. The Calamity's influence rages
      in the swamplands, and where  things get weird, stranger critters follow.
    first_encounter: >
      This fact is punctuated by the **Bayou  Biters** that will show up and attack you here.
      They're not challenging foes – dispatch them by using Fast  Attacks with the Machete
      (or Bio-Lash if you want to test it), then loot them for any ** Mutant Glands** or
      **Grubby Teeth** they might drop. If you get injured, you can meditate by  touching the
      **[Touch Pad/View Button]** and heading to the "Meditation" screen. At  this point in the game,
      you've got more time than disposable healing salves (made from gator  fat and strange herbs)
      on your hands.
    regeneration_note: "Note: Gene naturally regener ates Vitality very slowly due to his Erpenthrope nature. It will take a long time to regenerate from near- death to full health without aid."
    finding_datachip: >
      When you're done picking on Bit ers, return to your **Gator-Skiff** (a flat-bottomed boat
      powered by a sputtering, solar -charged outboard motor) and from it head north-west, just
      past a small, overgrown trail. There , with your Erpenthrope Senses active, you should spot a
      **Pre-Calamity Datachip**  (looking like a chunky 8-track tape) lying on the ground,
      half-buried in mud.  Gene will guess this odd object belongs to Mama Mambo, recognizing her
      distinctive bone-and-feather charm  tied to it. Might come in handy.
    senses_note: "Note: Using Erpenthrope  Senses will cause interactable (usually lootable) objects to glow with a faint yellow bio-luminescence. Quest -related interactable objects will glow red. Aggressive creatures will be shown as white ripples in your perception (of varying size,  depending upon proximity). Objects that can be affected by specific Erpenthrope abilities will have that ability's symbol over  them – typically objects that can be shattered with a powerful Erpenthrope roar (Aard-equivalent) or ignited  with Spitfire."
    travel_prep: >
      That's enough goofing around for now. Time to head  over to your Gator-Skiff, start the
      finicky motor, and follow Croaker. Don't worry,  we'll return to explore this murky
      backwater in more detail shortly. Summon your Skiff (if it  drifted) by whistling sharply
      **[Double-tap L3/LS]**. While piloting, hold down **[X /A]** to open the throttle,
      double-tap and hold **[X/A]** to push it to  its noisy max, press **[Circle/B]** to make a
      sharp turn (or jump small obstacles  if you've upgraded the hull), and hold **[Circle/B]**
      to cut the engine and disembark.  **[Square/X]** and **[Triangle/Y]** can be used for clumsy
      melee attacks  from the Skiff, but it's not an ideal way to fight.
    journey_description: >
      There  are two larger, murky channels that eventually connect to the south – you want to
      follow the eastern of the two.  Croaker will comment on the state of the swamp and the
      increasing boldness of the Meat Processor Oligarchs from  Beetriot as you navigate,
      showing a decidedly un-Erpenthropic view of societal structures (which Gene doesn't  fail
      to comment on.) When the channel turns from heading south-east to south you'll spot a
      series of  rusted, Pre-Calamity warning signs east of the channel with three tattered
      scarecrows swinging  from them in various states of decay – a clear message from someone.
      Follow the channel south-west to find a "R ansacked Stilt-Village." The Calamity hits the
      poor swamp folk the hardest, and so it is here.  Leave the grieving inhabitants in peace
      for now and continue to follow Croaker south, then south-east, eventually passing under
       a dilapidated, vine-choked bridge.
    fast_travel_note: "Note: Old, barely functioning Pre -Calamity broadcast towers serve as fast-travel waypoints. To use one, simply approach its base, fiddle  with its chunky control panel **[X/A]**, then select any other discovered tower to transmit your location data for a  quick (and slightly nauseating) skiff-autopilot journey."

      - sub _section_title: "The Swamp Terror and the Mudlapper's Tavern"
        encounter_description:  >
          Some time later, Gene and Croaker will run across a scrap merchant's skiff being harassed
           by a **Swamp Terror** (a particularly large and aggressive mutated GE Alligator). The
          Erp enthropes will succeed at chasing the beast off (although not in depriving it of its
          meal of scavenged solar  panels) and Croaker will be superficially wounded by a thrashing
          tail in the process. Afterwards, the mal igned merchant will emerge from under his
          overturned skiff and offer to pay you for your good deed. If you demand  payment
          (using Bayou Charm for a better rate isn't out of the question), you'll find yourself 
          50 Pre-Calamity Scrip richer. Afterwards, the merchant will overhear you talking about
           Mama Mambo, and refer you to the tavern in the nearby settlement of Lickskillet proper –
          the  **Mudlapper's Tavern**.
        objectives:
          - objective_text: "For asking the  scrap merchant for a reward"
            reward: "50 Scrip"
        map_navigation: >
          If  you bother checking out your map, you'll note that you've traveled north-west from
          where you were before the  cutscene, and you should continue west along the channel from
          the "Collapsed Bayou Bridge" marked on your map.  Croaker and Gene will discuss the
          Swamp Terror's odd aggression. Seems Erpenthropes will gladly attribute  any odd monster
          behavior to the lingering effects of the Calamity or the meddling of Swamp Witches. 
          Keep riding east, cross "Gator-Jaw Crossing" (a series of precariously placed logs and
          planks ) to reach the main part of Lickskillet. Follow Croaker to the tavern and he and
          Gene  will tie up their skiffs and head inside.
        tavern_arrival: >
          Witness some tension in the tavern  between some local swampers and a finely dressed
          (but mud-stained) individual clearly from Beetriot, after  which Gene and Croaker will
          talk to the innkeeper, **Barkeep Bess**. If you didn't shaked own her cousin (the scrap
          merchant) earlier, she'll be thankful and give you four **Smoked  Gator Legs**. Keep
          talking to her to learn that there's no official contract for the Swamp Terror yet. 
          The Erpenthropes might speculate on why the beast has chosen abnormal hunting habits,
          but the  reason why there's no bounty can fully be blamed on the Meat Oligarchs keeping
          a tight grip on gator- related business. Other than that, she sells some questionable
          swamp stew and potent moonshine, and hasn't seen Mama  Mambo… although somebody else
          in the tavern may have.
        merchant_note: "Note: Merchants have a fixed  amount of Scrip on them at any given time. Fortunately, the entire economy of Lickskillet isn't  dependent upon our actions – if you meditate for a while (or complete other tasks), eventually the Merchants will replenish their Scrip, and  some of their wares (mostly scavenged junk or locally sourced goods)."

              Start out by talking to a pair of **Swamp  Scavengers** sitting north of where Croaker
              roosts. They're a pair of superstitious, wary  individuals, but if you use the
              **Bayou Charm** ability on one of them, you'll get  the information you seek – Mama
              Mambo passed through here a few days ago. In quite a hurry, mut tering about
              "resonant frequencies" and "the old rhythm."

            description: >
              Of course, it's not  the most reliable of information, so we might as well keep asking.
              Ignore the threesome playing "Bayou Bones"  (a complex game involving carved gator
              teeth and betting with bottlecaps) east of Barkeep Bess, and  instead talk to
              **Papa Ghede** further east, a strangely charismatic old man draped in 70s- era fabrics
              and animal bones, who seems to know more than he lets on. As far as tavern patrons go ,
              he's a rather unsettling chap, if a bit wearing on the patience with his riddles.
               Play as nice as the dialogue options will allow and you'll score some rare
              **Pre-Calam ity Coffee Grounds** for free, as well as the information you seek.
              He not only knows Mama Mambo  by her description ("She who walks with shadows and
              whispers to the roots"), but he knows *you*,  as well. Seems tales of Gator Gene travel
              far, perhaps carried on the swamp winds or the gossip of marsh rats. The  Scavengers
              from before were right, but lacked sufficient information. The local **Enforcers
              from  Beetriot** (Nilfgaardians equivalent) stationed nearby might know more, but Ghede
              warns they are  "all eyes and no heart."
      - sub_section_title: "A Game of Bayou Bones"
         introduction: >
          Talk to the threesome sitting at the table, and one grizzled old trapper will chase 
          the other two off, eager for a new challenger. Ask him about the Meat Oligarchy's recent
          movements , what he meant when he mentioned the "Whispers of the Deep Gator," and chat
          about Lickskillet' s future as far as Beetriot's influence is concerned. Once that's done,
          go to leave and he 'll ask you to play Bayou Bones with him. For more information on
          Bayou Bones, check out the  heading "Bayou Bones Strategies" (which would be a separate
          section in a full guide).
        game play_description: >
          Play your first match of Bayou Bones with the **Old Trapper**, and with any luck, you 
          should win. He's cagey, but his playstyle is predictable. If you play aggressively with
           your high-value "Gator King" teeth, he's really got no chance. Just don't  risk all your
          teeth in one round – you rarely get to draw new ones from the communal pouch. If you
           build up a comfortable lead (five "points" or more higher) you might just want to pass.
          This  will end the round for you, and there's a chance he'll spend himself to victory,
          but if he  does this on the first round, there's a good chance he just won't have any
          teeth left  to compete with on the next two rounds.
        rewards_and_next_steps: >
          When you win (best  two out of three rounds takes the game) you'll get the
          **"Gram Parsons' Jeweled Tooth "** carving, a unique game piece that has no specific
          swamp faction alignment – it can be played with any set.  Sweet. You can also buy more
          game pieces from Barkeep Bess – she sells five, including another generic "Sw amp Chief"
          Leader piece, three high-value "Twin-Headed Snapper" pieces with the "Bog Brothers "
          special ability (pieces that amplify duplicate pieces when played together) and a
          "Decoy Gland" piece . In any event, the Old Trapper will mention a certain
          "Stjepan the Tinkerer" you  should look up later in Beetriot if you're serious about
          Bayou Bones. All this starts the quest  "Collect 'Em All Gators." Seriously, be sure to
          buy these pieces as soon as you can – you might not be  able to later, and missing out
          on the "Decoy Gland," "Gator-Pulper,"  "Bayou Bushwhacker" and "Cypress Creek Creeper"
          pieces would be a shame.

              It's finally time  to start exploring – the Beetriot Enforcers can wait, they're not
              going anywhere any time soon. We' ll start with the settlement, where one would expect
              to receive plenty of odd jobs, and then move on to exploring the surrounding  bayous,
              focusing on points of interest as we go. Whenever possible our area of exploration
              will be centered  around a nearby **Jury-Rigged Relay Antenna** (which also double as
              fast travel locations), but when  that's not concise enough, geographic features
              (a sunken bio-dome, a gator graveyard, a  abandoned stilt-village) or simple
              directional bias (the north-eastern fetid swamp) will be used .
            scavenging_tips: >
              Anywho, first things first, head down the rickety walkway  from the tavern to the
              east a bit – there are a few floating crates tied to the docks worth looting, but  as
              a general rule every box, crate, and sack won't be pointed out (unless they have
              something  particularly noteworthy inside, like a rare 8-track tape or some intact
              Pre-Calamity snack cakes) – where  you'll find your old pal the **Scrap Merchant**.
              You remember him? He was almost eaten by a Swamp  Terror. Seems he salvaged some of
              his stock, but skiff repairs take time and are expensive (especially with  the 70s
              tech constraint making new parts hard to fabricate), so he's eager to sell off what
               goods he has while he waits. While it's nice to catch up with him, he doesn't really
               sell much of interest… unless you installed the "Retro Renegade Armor" DLC, in which
              case,  he'll have a full set of that reinforced denim and patched leather gear in his
              inventory. It's the best armor  we'll immediately have access to, and if you've got
              the Scrip, it's worth  buying.
            notice_board_discovery: >
              Turn around and follow the walkway west, looting dilapidated shacks and grabbing 
              glowing swamp herbs as it pleases you. It's a good way to score some questionable
              food,  crafting components (like **Rusted Cogs** and **Frayed Wires**), and perhaps
              a few  Scrip. Posted on a cypress tree to the south of the walkway you'll find the
              notice "WANTED: Unt ainted Honeycombs. Will pay top scrip. Large quantities welcome.
              Tomira, the Herbalist,  by the Bubbling Bog." Good to know.
            notice_board_details: >
              Continue west until  the walkway forks. At the fork you'll find the **Notice Board**
              – that staple of desperate settlements which bestows  quests upon us. Even better,
              just looking at the Notice Board (even without taking any of the notices) will  update
              your map with a variety of "Unexplored Locations." These range from **Mutant Nests**,
               **Guarded Stashes**, **Marauder Camps**, and other optional places worth exploring to
              score loot and  experience. The notices worth grabbing are "Contract: Wailing in the
              Cistern" which starts a quest of the same  name, and "Brother Missin'" which starts
              "Missing in the Muck." If you save and reload your game , new notices might appear
              (written on different scraps of weathered plastic or metal), but since none of them
               start new quests, there's not much point in bothering.

          - quest_name:  "The Burnt-Out Bait Shack (Twisted Firestarter)"
            introduction: >
              From the Notice  Board head south to find a very angry, grease-stained individual,
              **"Wrench" Willy**, cursing as he tink ers with a sputtering generator outside his
              forge (a converted pre-Calamity shipping container). Talk to the poor guy  and, as one
              would expect, he's rather snippy. Keep cool and he'll tell you that  somebody set his
              bait shack on fire – an act of arson he feels was brought on by tensions with locals
              who think  he's hoarding Pre-Calamity tech or, worse, consorting with the "Invisible
              Women" from  the conspiracy theories. Offer to help him for a price (or out of the
              goodness of your Erpenthrope heart ) and he'll agree to give you whatever he has left
              (which ain't much) to find  the cause of his misfortune. This begins the quest
              "The Burnt-Out Bait Shack."

                  First, note the **Grindstone** (an old,  repurposed engine flywheel) to the
                  north-east. Using it is free, and will sharpen your Machete, giving  you the
                  "Keen Edge" boon for 15 minutes. Score. Head behind Willy's forge and search  to
                  the south-east using your Erpenthrope Senses to spot some melted plastic and
                  unusual scorch  marks on the ground. Investigate them and Gene will deduce the
                  arsonist's clumsy actions.
               - step_description: >
                  Further south-east Gene will find footprints, which seem to belong to a  large
                  man wearing distinctive, patched boots. Follow them or less east to a
                  sickly-looking cypress tree , where Gene will detect the smell of cheap moonshine
                  and stale cigarette-surrogate (rolled swamp weed) –  a common combination for
                  Lickskillet's less savory elements. Keep following the tracks east to reach a
                   muddy embankment, then north-east until they terminate near a half-sunken canoe.
                  As drunk as our  arsonist was, he was at least wise enough to try and cover his
                  trail by taking to the water.
              -  step_description: >
                  Loot a rusty footlocker to the north and pass under a low-hanging stilt- house
                  to find where the tracks continue, north of the stilt-house. Signs of a struggle
                  are noted –  apparently our arsonist was attacked by **Grindylows** (small,
                  vicious water humanoids) and lost  his boots in the scuffle. The trail continues
                  to the west and onto the main walkway that runs through L ickskillet. Follow the
                  wounded arsonist's trail to a shack just south of the Mudlapper 's Tavern.
            confrontation: >
              Head inside and Gene will comment that we'll be able  to spot our arsonist by the
              wounds he bears. Search the eastern room (a lean-to made of  scrap metal) to find
              **Napp**, who is obviously drunk, injured, and reeking of moonshine. Talk  to him and
              he'll confirm Willy's suspicions – a combination of paranoia about Erpenthropes  and
              a belief that Willy was using an LLM to design his fishing lures (a serious taboo)
              led the arson ists to torch the business of a suspected "Automaton-lover." Knowing
              that he's in trouble,  however, he'll offer to give you his prized collection of
              Burt Reynolds 8-tracks to let him go. 
            outcomes:
              - outcome_title: "Let Napp Go"
                description: "If you accept,  Willy will be upset you couldn't find the arsonist, but he'll still offer his tinkering services to you … which is really the point of all this."

                   Alternatively, you can attempt to apprehend him. Doing so will provoke him to
                  attempt to fist fight you. You  can indulge him and pummel him into submission,
                  or you can use the **Bayou Charm** Sign to  subdue him and get him to come along
                  peacefully. In the former case, you'll appear back near Willy's  forge, in the
                  latter case, you'll have to escort Napp to him. Either way, the  outcome is the
                  same – Willy calls over some Lickskillet "Regulators" (local toughs who  maintain
                  a semblance of order), who decide Napp's arson and suspected Automaton use warrants
                  him  a trip to the "Re-education Pits" (a euphemism for being fed to the gators). 
                  Once they're gone, Willy decides Erpenthropes ain't so bad after all, and  will
                  offer to work his forge for you.

             tinkerer_access: >
              One way or another, we have a tinkerer at our disposal, which allows  us to repair
              our gear (especially the delicate 70s tech components), craft new items from
              schematics ( if we find any), break down old junk for components, and of course,
              peruse his wares. Dism antling hides (from mutated creatures), salvaged tech, and
              inferior weapons is a good idea, as it 's a fine way to score components at little
              cost. You also are able to turn more refined components into  more generic ones
              (e.g., **Intact Circuit Boards** into **Salvaged Wires** and **Plastic Sh ards**),
              but at this point in time, there's little need to do so. Consider dismantling all
              your  Junk, while leaving Crafting Components and Alchemy Ingredients alone. For more
              information on crafting, see the section " Scrap-Smithing & Swamp Brews."
            loot_and_next_steps: >
              Of  particular interest in his inventory are the **Expanded Gator-Hide Saddlebags**
              (for your skiff, not  a literal gator), which will increase your maximum inventory
              weight by 30, a boost of 50%. They  cost nearly 200 Scrip, however. Also, you might
              have – or nearly have – the  components required to upgrade your starting rags to the
              **Patchwork Bayou Vest**, depending on how diligently you looted the sh acks in
              Lickskillet. All of this costs Scrip however, and right now the best way to earn
               Scrip is by selling the strange swamp herbs we pick (some have medicinal or
              narcotic value). They 're plentiful, they grow everywhere, and each one is worth a
              Scrip or two. Hunting non-GE g ators or mutated swamp deer works, too, especially
              if you use the **Spitfire** ability to save wear  and tear on your Machete. Or…
              we could start exploring. That's an option, too. There 's nothing stopping you from
              hunting game, killing mutants, and picking herbs while we explore, either. In  fact,
              it's recommended! Yeah… let's do that.
