  background_and_hook:
    narrative: |
      The player encounters Skeeter Thibodeaux , a grizzled but generally amiable owner of a small, independent alligator processing shack on the outskirts of Lickskillet . Skeeter's business, like many mom-and-pop operations, relies on a steady, if modest,  supply of GE alligators from the nearby Saurian Sanctuary (during open seasons) or carefully managed local "ponds" charged  by solar arrays. Lately, his prize "Gatoraid Sonic Lure Mk II" – a vital piece of  1970s-aesthetic tech used to call in his semi-domesticated GE gators for processing or solar recharging – has  been malfunctioning spectacularly. Instead of emitting the usual soothing, gator-attracting frequencies (allegedly based on Gram Parsons ' pedal steel licks), it's been emitting ear-splitting screeches, unsettling the gators and attracting unwanted  attention from... something else.

      Skeeter is worried. The Meat Oligarchy is always looking for an excuse  to squeeze out smaller operators, and unreliable tech leading to missed processing quotas or, worse, rogue gators, could be  just the ammunition they need. He also fears the strange new "critters" the malfunctioning lure seems to be agitating  in the deeper swamp.

  objectives:
    - title: "Talk to Ske eter Thibodeaux"
      details:
        - 'Skeeter explains his plight with the "Gatoraid Sonic L ure Mk II." He might demonstrate its malfunction (a quick, painful burst of noise).'
        - "He' ll ask the player to investigate the lure and the nearby solar charging array it's usually plugged into, suspecting a  power surge or faulty wiring."
        - "He'll also mention hearing strange, aggressive chattering from a nearby dense  swamp patch after the lure goes haywire."
    - title: "Investigate the Gatoraid Sonic Lure Mk II &  Solar Array"
      details:
        - 'The player examines the Lure (see Entity Functional Profile below). It'' s a chunky device with wood paneling, oversized dials, and a VU meter that''s currently pegged in the red.'  # Escaped single quote
        - 'Using "Witcher Senses" equivalent (perhaps "Swamp Savvy"  or "Bayou Brainwave"):'
        - "  The Lure itself shows signs of internal component damage –  a fried capacitor, maybe a loose vacuum tube (if the 70s aesthetic goes that deep)."
        -  "  The solar array junction box it connects to has evidence of tampering or unusual wear – chewed wires, strange sticky residue." 
        - "If the player has repair skills/parts, they might attempt a temporary fix, but Skeeter will suggest the  problem might be more than just the Lure."
    - title: "Follow the Disturbances into the Swamp" 
      details:
        - "Based on Skeeter's information and clues at the array (tracks, residue), the  player heads into a designated patch of dense swamp."
        - "The environment gets more ominous. They might hear the  agitated chattering."
    - title: "Confront the Source of the Tampering"
      details:
         - "The player discovers a small nest of Vampire Bunnies, agitated and unusually bold."
        - "It seems  the malfunctioning Lure's high-pitched frequency, while scaring gators, is deeply irritating to the Vampire Bunnies, driving  them to chew on anything nearby, including the solar array wiring. They might also be attracted to the specific energy discharge."
       player_choice_conflict:
        options:
          - title: "Eliminate the Bunnies"
            description:  "Combat encounter. Vampire Bunnies are fast, surprisingly vicious, and might have a minor draining attack."
          -  title: "Pacify/Relocate (Harder)"
            description: "If the player has specific knowledge (from  a Swamp Witch, perhaps?) or a rare item, they might be able to lure the bunnies away or calm them.  This could involve finding a specific plant they like or using a counter-frequency."
          - title: "Ignore & Focus on Repair  (Risky)"
            description: "The bunnies might continue to cause problems."
    - title: "(Conditional ) Repair or Modify the Gatoraid Sonic Lure Mk II"
      details:
        - "If the bunnies are dealt  with, the player can return to the Lure."
        - repair_option: "With the right components (sc avenged or bought), the player can repair the Lure to its original function."
        - modification_option: " A clever player might realize they can *modify* the Lure. Perhaps they can tune it to emit a frequency that  specifically *deters* Vampire Bunnies while still attracting gators (or a different frequency for each). This might involve repur posing a component from a defeated bunny or another piece of 1970s tech. This creates the Sonic Gator Caller reward ."
    - title: "Report Back to Skeeter"
      details:
        - "Explain what happened and the solution ."
        - 'Skeeter expresses his gratitude, pays the player, and gives them the unique "Sonic Gator Caller " if they successfully modified the Lure (or a simpler reward if they just repaired it/killed bunnies). He might also share  a rumor about the "Invisible Women" being behind tech malfunctions to stir up trouble for small businesses.'
