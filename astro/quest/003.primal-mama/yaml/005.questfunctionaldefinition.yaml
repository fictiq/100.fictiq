   name: Swamp-Bloat Blues
  id: QST_PM_LKSK_001
   giver: Mama Agnes "Aggie" Thibodeaux
  location: "Aggie's Gator Ranch, outskirts of  Lickskillet"
  suggestedPlayerLevel: 'Low-Mid (focus on investigation, minor combat/ hazard)'
  logEntryInitial: |
    Mama Aggie, a weathered but tough-as-nails g ator rancher near Lickskillet, is losing her prized sun-soakers. Her genetically engineered alligators are  falling ill with something she calls 'Swamp Bloat' – they get sluggish, their solar chromatophores dim, and they eventually wash  up belly-up. She's desperate, fears ruin, and suspects everything from bad swamp water to the machinations of the big  Beetriot meat oligarchs. She needs someone to find out what's killing her gators before her whole operation goes  under.
  worldContextIntegration:
    description: This quest leverages several core Primal Mama elements.
     elements:
      - "Alligator Biogenesis & Solar Dominance: The sickness directly affects the GE alligators' solar  energy absorption."
      - "Lickskillet vs. Beetriot: Highlights the struggles of mom-and- pop operations against potential oligarchy pressure."
      - "1970s Tech Aesthetic: Clues and solutions might involve retro -tech components or diagnostic tools."
      - "Swamp Environment: The investigation will involve exploring the bayou." 
      - "Potential for Supernatural/Strange Science: The cause could be mundane, a result of the Calamity 's lingering effects, or even involve fringe elements like Swamp Witch byproducts or misapplied bio-engineering."
   phases:
    - phaseNumber: 1
      title: The Sick Sun-Soakers
      objective: "Investigate  Mama Aggie's ranch and examine the afflicted GE Alligators."
      details: |
        Player meets Mama Aggie,  who explains the situation, her fears, and her limited resources. She might offer a rusty, 1970 s-style "Bio-Scanner" with flickering analog readouts.
        Player uses their "Primal Senses " (or the Bio-Scanner) to examine sick/dead alligators.
      clues:
        -  "Noticeably dull, almost cloudy, solar chromatophores."
        - "Unusual, faint humming or crackling  sound from their internal bio-batteries if the scanner is sensitive enough."
        - "No obvious external wounds or  parasites beyond what's typical for swamp life."
        - "Strange, almost metallic sheen or residue on the scales  of the worst-affected gators, near their solar absorption arrays."
      challenge: "A few overly stressed,  sick gators might become briefly aggressive if approached carelessly."

    - phaseNumber: 2
      title: Water , Weeds, and Worries
      objective: "Investigate the environment around Aggie's ranch for potential  contaminants or anomalies."
      details: |
        Player explores the water sources, feeding areas, and nearby swamp. 
      clues:
        - "Discover a patch of unusually vibrant, almost pulsating, algae or fungus downstream from  an old, half-submerged structure. The 1970s Bio-Scanner might go haywire near it, displaying  erratic energy readings."
        - "Optional: Find discarded, corroded tech components (e.g., old solar  capacitors, wiring with faded 1970s color-coding) near the strange growth, suggesting illegal dumping."
      challenge : "Potential for hostile swamp critters (regular gators, snapping turtles, maybe even a stray Vampire Bunny if near a known  Witch's territory, though not directly related to the bloat). Navigating murky water."

    - phaseNumber : 3
      title: The Glowing Gunk
      objective: "Identify the strange algae/fungus and  its connection to the Swamp Bloat."
      details: |
        Player collects a sample of the "Glowing G unk" (the pulsating algae/fungus).
        Analysis (either by the player if they have bio-skills , or by taking it to a contact – perhaps a reclusive "Swamp Doc" in Lickskillet who still uses old -school chemistry sets, or even cautiously approaching a Swamp Witch if desperate):
      discoveries:
        - | 
          The Glowing Gunk isn't directly toxic. Instead, it's a bizarre bio-organism that  *thrives* on specific energy frequencies or waste particulates leaked by *aging or improperly shielded solar-to-bio- energy conversion units* – the kind used in some older or shoddier GE gator models, or from dumped solar  tech.
        - |
          The Gunk forms a film on the gators' solar chromatophores, interfering  with energy absorption. The "metallic sheen" is the Gunk. The humming/crackling is the gator' s system struggling. The "bloat" is a systemic failure due to energy starvation.
      challenge: "If  approaching a Swamp Witch, this involves a social challenge, barter, or completing a small, weird task for her."

     - phaseNumber: 4
      title: Root Cause and Resolution
      objective: "Find the source of  the pollutant feeding the Glowing Gunk and deal with it."
      details:
        paths:
          - path ID: A
            title: Illegal Dumping
            condition: 'If clues pointed to dumped tech, trace it back.'
             outcomes:
              - "A forgotten pre-Calamity dumpsite disturbed by swamp erosion."
               - "A local scavenger operation carelessly discarding hazardous parts."
              - "Potentially: a front operation for one of the Beetriot  meat oligarchs, cutting corners on waste disposal from a clandestine \"experimental\" gator parts workshop. (This escalates the quest )."
          - pathID: B
            title: Faulty Local Infrastructure
            condition: "The source might be a damaged , leaking solar relay station or an old, buried power conduit from Lickskillet's early post-Calamity days , built with subpar 1970s-era shielding."
        resolution:
          neutralizeGunk : "Apply a specific counter-agent (perhaps a concoction from the Swamp Doc/Witch, or a chemical mix the  player can synthesize if they have the recipe and components) to affected areas and gators. This might be a temporary fix  if the source isn't addressed."
          addressSource:
            - "If dumpsite/scavenger : Report to Lickskillet's (likely under-resourced) local enforcers, or confront the scavengers." 
            - "If Oligarchy: Gather proof (e.g., branded components, shipping manifests found on a 19 70s-style microfiche reader) for Mama Aggie. She might want to leak it to a rival, use it  as leverage, or just know who her enemy is. Direct confrontation is likely too dangerous for her/player at this stage ."
            - "If faulty infrastructure: Report to Lickskillet authorities. Player might need to jury-rig a temporary  shield or reroute something using available 1970s tech parts."

  coherenceProtocolAdherence:
    alethic: |
       The quest operates within the established rules: GE gators exist and are solar-powered; 1970s tech  aesthetic is present in tools and potential problem sources; environmental hazards are plausible in a post-Calamity swamp. The  "Glowing Gunk" is a new, strange biological entity, consistent with a world that has Swamp Witches and Vampire  Bunnies.
    deontic: |
      Mama Aggie's struggle reflects the "friction" with meat  oligarchies. Player actions (reporting dumping, confronting scavengers) interact with local law (or lack thereof). No direct  violation of major prohibitions like cattle consumption.
    axiological: |
      Values pride in local enterprise (Mama Agg ie), potential distrust of big corporations (Oligarchs), and ingenuity in problem-solving with available tech.
    epist emic: |
      The quest involves uncovering hidden knowledge (the nature of the Gunk, the source of pollution).  The reliability of information from different sources (Aggie's fears vs. scientific analysis) can be a minor theme.
