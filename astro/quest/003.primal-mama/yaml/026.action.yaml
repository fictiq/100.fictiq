i_quest_overview_narrative_hook:
  purpose: "Define the quest's core  concept, its place in the world, and how the player becomes involved, ensuring it reflects Primal Mama's unique atmosphere."
   quest_giver:
    entity_id: "NPC_LICK_Agnes_01"
    name : "Mama Agnes Weatherwax"
    location: "Her modest, somewhat ramshackle alligator farm on the outskirts  of Lickskillet, identifiable by the hand-painted sign \"Agnes's Awesome Alligators - Solar Strong! \" with a fading picture of Burt Reynolds giving a thumbs-up."
    core_functional_identity: "A  resilient, fiercely independent mom-and-pop alligator farmer. Embodies traditional swamp ingenuity and self-reliance. Her primary function is small -scale alligator breeding and meat processing. She values her autonomy and her prize GE Alligators. Limited by resources compared to the big  meat processors."
  preamble: |
    The humid air of Lickskillet hangs thick with the usual smells  of smoked gator, swamp gas, and cheap cologne. But today, there's an undercurrent of distress. Mama Agnes , a pillar of the small farming community known for her surprisingly efficient (if sometimes temperamental) solar-powered GE g ators, is in a state. Her prize breeding bull, "Sunshine," a magnificent 20-foot specimen with  custom-fitted 1970s-style solar-absorption panels (complete with faux wood grain), has vanished from his pen . Sunshine isn't just a gator; he's the key to Agnes's new line of "Solar  Supreme" hatchlings, her best shot at staying afloat against the ever-tightening squeeze of the Beetriot meat oligarchies. 
  player_hook: |
    The player might overhear distressed muttering at the Lickskillet general store, see  a hastily scrawled notice on the community board (chunkily typed, of course), or be directly approached by a  tearful (but still feisty) Mama Agnes, who's heard the player is "someone who gets things done , and ain't afraid of a little mud an' conspiracy."

ii_quest_objectives_progression:
   purpose: "Detail the steps required to complete the quest, ensuring logical flow and consistency with world rules and entity functions." 
  objectives:
    - title: "Objective 1: Talk to Mama Agnes"
      details: | 
        - Learn the details of Sunshine's disappearance. Agnes suspects foul play, possibly from "GatorCorp"  (a major meat oligarchy) or desperate poachers. She'll offer a modest reward of Crowns and a batch  of her famous "Solar-Kissed Gator Jerky."
        - Player may notice the 1970s -style security console for the pen is fried (chunky buttons, flickering CRT display showing "SYS.ERR 3 05: VOLTAGE IRREGULARITY").
      authentication: "Consistent with Lickskillet's socio-economic  tension (Deontic/Axiological – mom-and-pop vs. oligarchy), 197 0s tech aesthetic (Alethic). Agnes's motivation (keeping her farm) is key to her Functional Profile."

     - title: "Objective 2: Investigate Sunshine's Pen & Surrounding Area"
      details: |
         - Use "Primal Senses" (world-specific term for heightened awareness/tracking, possibly learned or innate ) to find clues.
          - Faint scent of unusual chemicals (not typical swamp smell).
          - Damaged section of  fence – looks cut, not broken by gator strength.
          - Large, non-alligator tracks leading away from the  pen towards the deeper swamp AND fainter vehicle tracks (old, beat-up airboat?) towards a disused service  canal often used by GatorCorp transport.
          - A dropped, cheap data-chip (1970s  8-track tape style) with corrupted, partial schematics for a basic gator tranquilizer dart system. The tech  is crude, but the design philosophy is suspiciously *not* 1970s – too sleek, too efficient  beneath the surface.
      authentication: "Establishes multiple possibilities. The data-chip hints at the Automaton/ LLM user stigma (Deontic – using \"aberrant\" tech design if not actual LLMs). GE  gator properties (Alethic – Sunshine is too big/smart to just wander off without cause)."

    -  title: "Objective 3: Follow the Trail / Gather Information in Lickskillet"
      details: |
        -  Player can choose which lead to follow first: the swamp tracks or the canal/GatorCorp angle.
        - Talking to  Lickskillet Locals:
          - Old Man Tiberius (local drunk, surprisingly observant): Saw an unfamiliar, quiet  airboat near the canal around the time of disappearance. Mentions it didn't have the usual "Burt Reynolds Air -Thrust" roar (a common, loud engine type). Auth: Local color, gun ownership/vehicle norms.
           - Jilly Sue (nervous GatorCorp clerk on her smoke break): Denies everything, but a successful persuasion/intim idation check (or offering her a rare pre-calamity chocolate bar) reveals GatorCorp has been "acquiring" independent  breeders' stock aggressively, sometimes using "less than savory" methods. Mentions a "Special Projects" division that uses weird , quiet tech – LLM-designed stuff, she heard, making her shiver. Auth: Oligarchy friction, Autom aton/LLM stigma.
      authentication: "Information gathering consistent with world's social dynamics."

    - title: " Objective 4 (Swamp Trail): Encounter Maw Maw M Learn (Swamp Witch)"
      details: |
         - The swamp tracks lead to an area known to be the territory of Maw Maw M Learn, a reclusive Swamp Witch.
         - Maw Maw M Learn (Entity ID: NPC_SWMP_MawMaw_01): Ancient , Cthulhu-goth-Southern vibe. Core Function: Guardian of her swamp patch, purveyor of esoteric  services, breeder of vampire bunnies. Capabilities: Ritual magic (divination, curses, charms), extensive swamp knowledge, commands  vampire bunnies. Limitations: Reclusive, distrustful of outsiders, requires payment/favors (often bizarre). Values: Balance  of the swamp, respect for old ways.
        - Maw Maw is not hostile but demands a "toll" for information:  retrieve three "Glow-Moss Tufts" from a nearby haunted cypress grove (Spectral Interaction – Alethic modality) or deal  with a particularly aggressive alpha vampire bunny that’s been bothering her prize-winning pitcher plants.
        - If player  helps, Maw Maw performs a ritual (using a 1970s-style transistor radio that picks up "spirit  frequencies") and reveals Sunshine isn't stolen, but *wandered off due to sickness*. She senses a "buzzing  sickness" from his "sun-skin" (solar panels). She points towards the old abandoned Solar Relay Station deeper in the swamp. 
      authentication: "Integrates Swamp Witch entity, their unique magic, and the world's spiritual miasma. Vampire  bunnies as a tangible element."

    - title: "Objective 5 (Canal Trail/GatorCorp): Investigate  Disused GatorCorp Holding Facility"
      details: |
        - The canal leads to an old, seemingly abandoned Gator Corp holding facility. The 1970s aesthetic is strong here – flickering neon sign, chunky keypad access (bypass able with tech skill or finding a code).
        - Inside: Some low-level GatorCorp thugs (using standard, noisy  weaponry – consistent with gun norms). They are jumpy, expecting someone. They were told to guard a "special delivery " that never arrived.
        - Evidence: Empty tranquilizer dart casings (matching the tech on the data-chip), a half -eaten (non-cattle) burger from a Beetriot chain, indicating recent presence of someone from the city.
         - A data-terminal (wood-paneled, with a green phosphor screen) can be hacked to reveal communications  about "Project Sunstone" – an attempt by a rogue GatorCorp R&D scientist (who is an LLM user) to  steal Sunshine for his unsanctioned experiments to create hyper-efficient (and aesthetically non-compliant) solar gators. He  planned to use the holding facility but Sunshine got spooked/sick and escaped.
      authentication: "Reinforces oligarchy' s reach, the 1970s tech, Automaton/LLM user stigma, and potential internal conflicts within Gator Corp."

    - title: "Objective 6: Track Sunshine to the Abandoned Solar Relay Station"
      details: | 
        - Both leads (or player's deduction) now point towards the Relay Station.
        - The station  is dilapidated, overgrown. The air crackles with misdirected solar energy. Sunshine is found weak, his solar panels sparking  erratically (a clear 1970s tech malfunction – bad wiring, a blown capacitor stylized like an old car  battery).
        - The rogue GatorCorp scientist, Dr. Aris Thorne (Entity ID: NPC_GCORP_Th orne_01), is here, trying to fix Sunshine with his "heretical" sleek, minimalist tools ( contrasting the 1970s aesthetic).
        - Dr. Thorne: Function: Rogue scientist, believes  in pure efficiency over aesthetics. Capabilities: Advanced (non-70s) tech knowledge, some Automaton support ( a clunky 70s-skinned drone that speaks with an LLM's perfect syntax – creating social discomfort). Limitations : Socially ostracized for his methods/LLM use, limited combat ability, reliant on his tech.
       authentication: "The 1970s tech aesthetic constraint as a point of failure and plot. The conflict between aesthetics and advancement ."

    - title: "Objective 7: Confront Dr. Thorne & Decide Sunshine's Fate"
       details: |
        - Dr. Thorne explains he "rescued" Sunshine, believing Agnes's "archaic" tech was  killing him. He admits he wanted to use Sunshine for his project but now just wants to save him. He believes Sunshine 's original 1970s solar panels are inherently flawed and need his "upgraded" (non- compliant) replacements.
      player_choices:
        - "Side with Thorne: Allow him to install his new  panels. Sunshine is saved and becomes hyper-efficient, but Mama Agnes might be ostracized for owning an \"aberrant- tech\" gator. Thorne might offer compensation or future tech help."
        - "Repair the Old Panels: Use  technical skills (or find parts/manuals in the station) to fix Sunshine's original 1970s panels.  Sunshine is saved, tradition upheld. Thorne is furious/disappointed. (This could involve a mini-game of matching  chunky wires or replacing vacuum tubes)."
        - "Turn Thorne in to GatorCorp (or Lickskillet authorities ): Results in Thorne's arrest. GatorCorp might \"confiscate\" Sunshine for \"study\" (bad for Agnes) or  reward the player (and still take Sunshine)."
        - "Kill Thorne / Incapacitate Thorne & Take Sunshine: Combat . Player takes Sunshine back, but the panel issue might remain if not addressed."
      authentication: "Player agency impacting outcomes , reflecting world values (tradition vs. progress, aesthetic compliance)."

    - title: "Objective 8:  Return to Mama Agnes"
      details: |
        - Report Sunshine's fate and your actions.
         - Rewards and consequences vary based on choices.
          - "Sunshine returned safe (original tech): Agnes is overjoyed, reward  + jerky + local hero status in Lickskillet."
          - "Sunshine returned (Thorne's tech): Agnes  is conflicted, reward + some social awkwardness. Possible future plot hooks with Thorne's tech."
          - " Sunshine lost to GatorCorp: Agnes is devastated, minimal reward, player reputation in Lickskillet suffers."
          -  "Thorne dealt with: GatorCorp might send a \"thank you\" (or a threat)."
      authentication: "Actions  have logical consequences within the world's systems."
