     level_equivalent: 'High'
    description: |
      Our stated goal is to talk to Old Man  Croaker about our next move after the ambush at the Gator Farm... but really, it's about everyone processing what  went down. Do so, then pay your respects at the memorial bonfire if you wish. When you're done,  head north along the main channel to meet with Clem, Mama Mambo, Old Man Croaker, and possibly that slick  Beetriot tech-broker, Silas.

      Mama Mambo, a Swamp Witch of considerable power, will propose seeking  out some… unconventional allies from the deeper, wilder parts of the bayou – perhaps rogue Erpenthrope clans  or isolated witch covens that even *she* finds unsettling. Conventional tactics clearly didn't cut it against Brutus Clamp' s enforcers at the Gator Farm. Her bargaining chip might be access to a rumored cache of pre-Calamity schematics  for advanced solar collectors, something incredibly enticing, especially with Mayor Beauregard of Beetriot trying to monopolize all energy production . Clem will interrupt your scheming, demanding a say in *her* destiny before ultimately taking off in a huff in  her custom airboat.

      - id: 'clem_confidence_1'
         title: "Clem: Primal Spirit or Swamp Fright #1 - Gator Tail Tussle"
         context: "After Clem and Old Man Croaker have a tense exchange outside the remnants of the Gator Farm's main lab (still  smelling of burnt circuits and ozone), you'll get a chance to make a timed decision."
        options:
          -  text: "Relax, kid. You ain't gotta wrestle every gator in the bayou."
            con sequence: "Causes Clem to doubt her burgeoning strength."
          - text: "Think I know what might lift your  spirits, gator-girl."
            consequence: "Bolsters Clem's primal spirit. Leads to a  'Gator Tail Tussle' mini-game."
        mini_game_note: "If latter option picked: Ind ulge in a 'Gator Tail Tussle'—using discarded (regenerated) GE Alligator tails,  you'll have a playful throwing match. Pick up more 'ammo' from conveniently placed molted tails."

       - id: 'clem_confidence_2'
        title: "Clem: Primal Spirit or Swamp  Fright #2 - Beetriot Politics or Bayou Vengeance"
        context: "Whatever you say, Clem  will shake you awake by your hammock later, proposing a bold plan to get even with Brutus Clamp and the forces that  hit the Gator Farm, which starts the quest 'Sawtooth Butte Showdown.' After she explains her plan (which involves  hitting Clamp's personal stronghold on Sawtooth Butte), you'll get a timed dialogue response."
        options:
           - text: "Gotta visit Mayor Beauregard in Beetriot first."
            consequence: "Suggests travel to Beet riot en route to the deep swamp to see the Mayor. Opens Clem's eyes to political possibilities."
            leads _to_location: 'Beetriot'
            if_chosen_scenario:
              description: "If Clem goes  to Beetriot, not only will this open her eyes to the stark contrast between the elite's luxury and the swamp 's struggle (and her potential place in challenging it), but Mayor Beauregard will offer you the other half of  your 'finder's fee' for that pre-Calamity data-slate you recovered last month."

                prompt: "This presents another chance to influence Clem via a timed dialogue option."

                    consequence_on_clem: "Bolsters Clem' s conviction."
              aftermath: "After the decision, have a tense chat with Beauregard's smarmy aide,  then leave with Clem, who'll be rather riled up... by Beetriot's decadence, and possibly your pragmatism , depending on whether you took the Old Bucks or not."
          - text: "Alright, Sawtooth Butte it is." 
            consequence: "Skips going to Beetriot entirely. Keeps Clem from ever seeing the opulent, corrupt heart of  the oligarchy."
    next_quest_triggered_by_choice: "Sawtooth Butte Showdown"

   - title: "Sawtooth Butte Showdown"
    level_equivalent: 'High'
    entry_ description: |
      Clem and [Player Name/Erpenthrope Name] will land their airboat near Sawtooth  Butte, a jagged rock formation jutting out of the southern cypress maze. Nearby is the "Whisperwind Channel"  signpost, currently inaccessible due to high spiritual interference (ghosts are thick here). Talk to Clem a bit, then  head along a nearly submerged boardwalk to the south-east a short distance before following her up some rickety stairs and to  a stilt-village clinging to the Butte's base, currently in the throes of a "Jerry Reed Jubilee ." Chat with some surprisingly friendly (if heavily 'shine-influenced) swamp folk until they refer you to Granny Fang, the  local Swamp Witch elder, who can grant access to the higher paths of Sawtooth Butte.
    location_details: 
      jubilee_village:
        description: "Stilt-village at the base of Sawtooth Butte,  hosting a 'Jerry Reed Jubilee'."
        points_of_interest:
          - type: "Swap Meet Vendor "
            details: "Sells 'Bog Brew' and 'Muscadine Wine' (for 'White Lightning' spirit  crafting), copious amounts."
          - type: "Scrap-Welder"
            details: "Journe yman level craftsman. Repairs 70s-tech gear, dismantles/sells salvaged components, crafts new items. Shack  built into an old airboat hull."
      trail_to_granny_fang:
        description: |
           Head along a trail north of the village, past shrines adorned with Burt Reynolds posters, and you'll run into a couple of  surprisingly articulate Bog Babies… and perhaps that reclusive Swamp Sprite, Flicker, if you previously helped her relocate her glowing fungi patch. Chat  with the cryptid(s), who will try to warn you away from the Butte with surprisingly coherent (if high-pitched) arguments , and when that fails, will point you towards Granny Fang’s shack. Continue north-west, between some moss -covered, ancient-looking pylons (remnants of pre-Calamity infrastructure?), and over a swaying rope  bridge, then north through another encampment of Jubilee revelers.
        secondary_vendor:
          type: "Swap Meet  Vendor"
          details: "Mostly sells questionable alligator jerky and 'lucky' raccoon bones."
    granny_fangs_ trial:
      title: "Granny Fang's Trial"
      description: |
        You'll find Granny  Fang in a shack adorned with alligator skulls and flickering, jury-rigged neon signs, who will be quick to send Clem off to  "commune with the Ancestor Spirits" (a task for young Erpenthropes). You, however,  are not so lucky, and will have to agree to complete a trial to have the "honor" of an audience with  the Butte's guardian spirits (and gain passage). Fair enough. The trial will be set. Take a swig  of her "Sight-Beyond-Swampwater" brew and take a leap of faith from the designated outcrop.
       steps:
        - task: "Dive into murky, bioluminescent water."
        - task: "Shoot two aggressive , mutated Catfish ('Whiskered Biters' - level equivalent) with your spear gun."
        - task : "Swim east into an underwater cavern lit by strange, solar-absorbing crystals."
        - task: "Activate your Erp enthrope Senses (or specially tuned 70s sonar goggles) and snatch the 'Ancestor''s Tooth'  (an ancient, fossilized gator tooth amulet) from the silty bottom."
        - task_optional:  "Loot a submerged, pre-Calamity strongbox in the cave."
        - note: "No  sense in exploring the cave too much, though; the brew's making your head spin."
      alternative_paths _to_granny_fang:
        - path_description: "Swim to and scale some slippery ledges to the west . For extra grit, head south along precarious-looking catwalks to find a rogue, cybernetically-enhanced Bull Gator  Alpha (level equivalent) near a cave entrance. Lure it to open ground. Defeat it, then head through its  cave lair (filled with scavenged 70s tech parts and bones), turning south at a fork. Exit cave, run  south-west along catwalks, scale a ledge, head uphill to the east to return to the stilt-village, then  find Granny Fang."
          encounter: "Cybernetically-enhanced Bull Gator Alpha"
        - path_description: "If  not tangling with cyber-gator, follow a trail north, then east from the water where you dove for the Ancest or's Tooth. Climb two ledges, head east up stairs made of salvaged boat hulls. You'll be  north of Granny Fang's shack. Talk to her and present the Ancestor's Tooth."
      completion: "Gr anny Fang will grunt approvingly and grant you access to the path leading up Sawtooth Butte."
      objective_reward :
        objective: "For completing Granny Fang's trial"
        reward: '300 Bayou Cred  / Experience'
    ascent_and_first_encounter:
      description: |
        Follow Granny Fang's  acolyte, a quiet woman named Marica with unsettlingly reflective eyes, up the mountain to some heavy, rust- covered metal doors (clearly pre-Calamity). She'll manipulate a series of chunky levers with a practiced hand , and the doors will groan open. Head into the cavern complex and travel north-east, then north, dropping down a ledge. 
      encounter:
        name: "Papa T-Bone"
        type: "Hulking, territorial Erpenth rope (level equivalent)"
        trigger: "Comments on the Ancestor's Tooth, then attacks mistaking intentions."
         behavior: "Stomps, throws rocks, roars. Defeated by harpoon gun or Erpenthrope wrestling ."
        aftermath: "When he yields (or is incapacitated), [Player Name] and Clem will see to the division  of labor and split up."
    split_paths:
      clem_vs_bile_sisters:
         character: 'Clem'
        path_description: "Head north-west, drop down a ledge, examine  chasm. Leap into chasm, swim south-west to hidden landing. Continue down narrow, root-choked passage south -west to vast, geothermally heated chamber."
        encounter:
          name: "The Bile Sisters" 
          type: "Two corrupted Swamp Witches allied with Brutus Clamp"
          context: "Found in a vile ritual  involving stolen solar accumulators and vampire bunnies in cages. Forms shift from alluringly retro (70s swamp disco)  to monstrous when Clem makes her presence known, and violence shortly ensues."
          combat_tips: |
            Straight forward for emerging Erpenthrope. Clem regenerates vitality quickly. Stay mobile.
            Weeping Wisp (t aller one): Acts like mutated Mud Skipper, dissolves to oily puddles and re-emerges to fling corrosive swamp gas bombs at  you. Telegraphs attacks.
            Clem's resilient hide shrugs off the worst of the goo.
            Use two  fast claw strikes or tail whips, then dodge. Sisters may teleport in a puff of fetid smoke or counter-attacks with enchanted  shivs.
            Primal Fury Meter full: Use "Alligator Death Roll" attack (hold down [Attack Button])  to score some cheap hits—just be far enough away when you start it, as it takes time to charge.
             When the first one falls (the Bloated Brewess, being slower and relying on area-of-effect curses,  makes her an easy first target) the fight becomes even easier.
      player_vs_brutus_clamp: 
        character: '[Player Name]'
        preparation: "Equip best 70s-style grenade launcher  (loaded with 'Swamp Gas' canisters) equipped and make sure you have healing poultices and solar-charge packs for  your gear ready."
        path_description: "Head north along a treacherous cliff-side trail and cross a narrow , natural rock bridge. Once across the bridge immediately turn east and touch a Resonance Point (a naturally occurring solar energy focusing crystal,  humming with power) – another helpful buff for the upcoming encounter. Continue up a narrow trail to the north-west, scale a ledge , then leap over a fissure in the path."
        encounter:
          name: 'Brutus "The Bruiser"  Clamp'
          type: "Mountain of an Erpenthrope clad in scavenged industrial armor plating (complete with unnecessary  wood paneling accents)."
          context: "Indulging in… well, it looks like he's trying to hotwire  a giant, pre-Calamity satellite dish with a bunch of terrified technicians."
          phase_1_combat: " Deceptively easy at first—he'll lazily swing his humongous, jury-rigged hydraulic pylon  hammer, which, when wielded one-handed is just too slow to hit a seasoned swamp fighter. Wait for him to attack , then dodge around him (or use your own Erpenthrope dash if you are one), and hit him a few times in  the exposed joints of his armor. Repeat until he's at half health."
          phase_2_combat: | 
            He'll roar, drop his makeshift shield (a reinforced manhole cover), and activate a salvaged, back -mounted thruster pack (spewing oily smoke). Now sporting a two-handed grip on his pylon hammer and  using short, uncontrolled bursts from his thruster, he attacks much faster.
            Spam dodge—do nothing else  aside from maybe trying to apply a "Rust Mite" grenade (if you have them) or activating your personal solar-shield  (if equipped). Be wary, as he'll use the thruster to erratically dash, sometimes appearing behind you, forcing  you to change the direction of your dodge.
            He'll unleash a flurry of activity, and your job is  to survive and look for an opening when his thruster pack sputters. Shortly, he'll tire himself out  (or his thruster will overheat), giving you the opportunity to land a good hit or two. Repeat this process until  he falls, his retro-futuristic armor clattering on the rock.
    main_objective_reward:
       objective: "For avenging the Gator Farm ambush"
      reward: '1000 Bayou Cred / Experience '
    post_battle_choice_solar_geode:
      context: |
        [Player Name] and Clem  will meet up, sharing a moment of grim satisfaction after their dual victories. When the conversation turns towards the future say "Not quite yet , kid.", as this will allow you to exploring Sawtooth Butte further.
        Return to where you fought Brutus Clamp and loot  his dented armor.
      item_found: "Pulsating 'Solar-Charged Geode' – a  rare crystal that hums with stored solar energy."
      dilemma: |
        Head back down from Saw tooth Butte, past the Resonance Point and cross the rock bridge to the south. Follow the trail until you find a swamp  folk elder named Stregomir arguing with other villagers, who are now worrying about how their settlement's water purifier ( powered by similar, weaker geodes) will function without a fresh power source.
      options:
        - action: "Give them  the one you got from Brutus."
          consequence: "The villagers are grateful, and their water purifier is restored ."
        - action: "Keep it for yourself."
          consequence: "If you consume it (by crushing and inhaling  its energized dust), you'll gain two Primal Essence points (Ability Points)."
      rhetorical_question: " Doesn't seem like much of a choice when those ability points could mean better solar-powered punches, does it?" 
    return_to_lickskillet_and_fallout:
      description: |
        Clem and [Player  Name] will take the airboat back to Lickskillet, where you'll see the outcome of your choices  during the quest "Now or Never" (if that was a quest involving choosing between helping the mages or the Witch Hunters –  substitute "Swamp Witches" or "Rogue Tech-Priests" vs. "Oligarchy Enforcers"  or "Purity Cultists"). The Meat Oligarchy's enforcers have either finished their crackdown on independent gator po achers, or, in their failure, they've turned to blaming the "Invisible Women" (the popular conspiracy theory ) for the unrest. In "The Rusty Mug" or "The Singing Crawdad Saloon," (run by a  charismatic bard named "Dandy" Dan) you'll learn that Old Man Croaker is waiting for you at his shack deep in  the Bayou, but there's plenty more to do before we talk to him.
    next_quests_un locked:
      - "Final Preparations in the Bayou"
      - "Clearly Corrupted"
      -  "Payback's a Bayou Bitch"
      - "The Great Escape from Beetriot's Gulag"
     open_world_note: |
      Finally, choices that aren't just about Clem's mood! We also have free  run of the accessible swamp regions for the first time since we started the "Isle of Mists" equivalent (perhaps  "The Phantom Cypress Grove" quest). Since we've gained a good bit of experience and salvaged tech since then,  we should be able to handle just about every unfinished side job or bounty on the Lickskillet notice board. Of  particular interest ware the high-end Erpenthrope artifacts or schematics for Master-Crafted 1970s retro -tech gear, which will serve us well and might be worth going after.
    player_choice_prompt:  "Either go on some salvage runs for rare components, hunt some legendary cryptids, or skip to the next main story  quests... all of which are related to the quest 'Final Preparations in the Bayou.'"
